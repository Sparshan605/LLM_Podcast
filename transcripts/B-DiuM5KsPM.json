"03:12", "slow the spread and allow our backup our", "03:15", "public health system to catch up at a", "03:18", "certain point we have to come out of", "03:20", "that tactical pause we have to come out", "03:22", "of that retreat and start engaging in", "03:25", "the enemy a little bit now we do that", "03:27", "slowly when we do it carefully and so I", "03:29", "think that's the I like to look at it", "03:31", "that way as the conversation about how", "03:32", "to reopen society at a certain point we", "03:35", "have to move away from risk containment", "03:36", "and room move into a risk mitigation", "03:38", "strategy and we're ramping up our", "03:40", "production of things like ventilators of", "03:42", "PPE of testing capability in order to do", "03:46", "that now there's some talk of when this", "03:52", "is going to end and I don't know how you", "03:55", "even make that distinction how does one", "03:57", "make a decision and it seems like one of", "04:00", "those things where once it starts once", "04:02", "you lock a country down and tell people", "04:04", "stay away stay home don't go to work", "04:07", "don't do anything unless it's very", "04:08", "essential like

there's a lot of", "04:23", "different ways to think about that from", "04:24", "from the public health perspective I", "04:26", "hear them", "04:27", "say certain things like after 14 days of", "04:31", "a downward trend in cases then we can", "04:34", "start reopening when the R is less than", "04:38", "1 then you can start reopening so R", "04:41", "being less than 1 means for every", "04:42", "contagious person they infect less than", "04:44", "one other person right now that numbers", "04:46", "are at just over 2 ok so there's there's", "04:49", "an obvious spread that occurs that I", "04:52", "have I think those are valid assumptions", "04:55", "I definitely question using those as our", "04:58", "standards I would like to see us use", "05:00", "other standards as well such as are we", "05:03", "at a point where we're testing enough", "05:05", "and we have enough ventilators and", "05:06", "hospital bed space and PPE to actually", "05:10", "fight the virus alongside reopening", "05:13", "there our society because I think we", "05:15", "have to come to terms with a very", "05:16", "certain truth which is we cannot", "05:19", "indefinitely lock down those costs are", "05:21", "enormous and they're not just cost to", "05:23", "our 401ks and our jobs I mean there's a", "05:27", "public health cost there too you know I", "05:29", "speak with doctors here in Houston we", "05:30", "don't we don't have a huge case number", "05:32", "in Houston where our hospitals are like", "05:34", "50% empty right now and they can't do", "05:37", "much needed surgeries procedures because", "05:40", "you know what's called an elective", "05:43", "surgery is gonna be kind of a gray area", "05:44", "so a lot of stuff isn't getting done", "05:46", "from a public health side also there's", "05:48", "there's there's I think the obvious", "05:50", "public health crisis when people don't", "05:51", "have jobs there's divorce race there's", "05:53", "suicides we have to really take all of", "05:55", "this into account as we as we talk about", "05:58", "when to reopen society yeah we you and I", "06:01", "privately had this conversation through", "06:03", "text messages about the way reporters", "06:07", "are using this moment to criticize Trump", "06:10", "with in ridiculous ways and one of them", "06:14", "was this questioning of whether or not", "06:19", "he should describe these drugs that have", "06:22", "some promise which many doctors are", "06:24", "describing hydroxychloroquine with z-pak", "06:27", "and zinc apparently is a combination",

is that these", "06:41", "are rare opportunities that someone has", "06:43", "to talk to the president and they're", "06:45", "using it to chastise him for bringing up", "06:48", "drugs that do show promise and hope he's", "06:51", "not telling people to go take it he's", "06:53", "not advocating it he's not pretending", "06:55", "that he's some sort of a medical", "06:56", "professional he's just talking about", "06:58", "some things that show promise in the", "07:00", "medical community you know what what is", "07:03", "your take on all this because this is a", "07:05", "it's a weird situation that he finds", "07:07", "himself in with the press this very", "07:09", "strange and antagonistic position yeah", "07:16", "you know the press needs to figure out", "07:19", "who they want to be and it's actually", "07:22", "like chapter two in my book it's called", "07:24", "who is your hero and that in that", "07:26", "conversation is about who we think we", "07:28", "should be like what what kind of people", "07:29", "do we think we should be what does it", "07:31", "mean to be a good American a good", "07:33", "citizen the press believes it is their", "07:35", "duty to only be adversarial to to", "07:39", "politicians mostly conservative", "07:41", "politicians they don't treat Democrats", "07:42", "the same way but and that is their job", "07:45", "okay I wish they would treat all all", "07:47", "politicians the same and intuitive to an", "07:50", "extent that is their job to be", "07:51", "adversarial to question what is coming", "07:54", "out of government but I would argue that", "07:56", "their main purpose is to simply educate", "07:59", "the public educate the public with full", "08:03", "that's a fax full context full", "08:06", "understanding of what's going on I think", "08:08", "on that point they're utterly failing", "08:10", "I'm into to a huge extent I think I've", "08:11", "been feeling for a long time but in a", "08:13", "time of crisis where it's so important", "08:14", "that they actually do that that that", "08:16", "more important thing of informing the", "08:18", "public they're really failing and they", "08:19", "they do they completely waste time I", "08:22", "mean how many reporters actually get", "08:23", "access to the president I bet there's", "08:25", "hundreds of thousands of reporters out", "08:26", "there good ones who would who would love", "08:29", "to be able to be in that press briefing", "08:31", "room and actually asked legitimate", "08:33", "questions that would inform the American", "08:35", "public but but they don't they play", "08:37", "these gotcha games you know the last", "08:38", "questions like what do you want to say", "08:41", "to people who are upset with you right", "08:42", "now", "08:43", "it's like what how is how does that a", "08:45", "good question how does a news right in", "08:48", "the middle of Japan I mean I mean it was", "08:50", "it's so utterly absurd", "08:53", "and an unnecessary actually whole list", "08:55", "of questions I don't wanna read of all", "08:56", "but they're there they're a complete", "08:59", "waste of time", "08:59", "and I think they're failing us miserably", "09:02", "and then there's the opportunism that", "09:03", "occurs like listen there's if you're", "09:06", "writing an op-ed if you're a journalist", "09:07", "writing an op-ed we'll say an opinion", "09:10", "journalists especially I fully", "09:13", "understand why you you might you might", "09:15", "say you might write in your report", "09:17", "okay the president said this today but", "09:19", "three weeks ago they said this so", "09:21", "there's been a change that's fine that", "09:24", "makes total sense that provides context", "09:26", "of the reader even it might be biased", "09:28", "and that whatever but but but - but -", "09:31", "onlys do that indirect questioning with", "09:34", "the president just to try and play this", "09:35", "gotcha game I it's not helpful it's not", "09:39", "help at all and it's not informing", "09:40", "anybody in the least you know you", "09:42", "mentioned the the president talking of a", "09:45", "verbal II about the chloroquine or", "09:48", "hydroxychloroquine and you remember the", "09:51", "the couple that ingested that out in", "09:53", "Arizona because that something something", "09:57", "similar to I think it's a core", "09:59", "chloroquine phosphate or something like", "10:01", "that it might be Mississippi cane its", "10:02", "points like that's ending yeah it's an", "10:04", "ingredients on fish bowl cleaner yeah", "10:06", "fish tank cleaner so they saw it and", "10:08", "they ingested it which was obviously a", "10:10", "terrible idea", "10:10", "nobody would nobody told them to do that", "10:12", "and then the media the media instead of", "10:15", "saying wow this is a shame that they did", "10:18", "this they blame the president and they", "10:22", "blamed the president for talking about", "10:23", "what what is a at least anecdotally a", "10:25", "proven way to to combat this disease we", "10:28", "don't know through clinical trials", "10:30", "whether in mass it'll actually work but", "10:33", "but to express optimism over it seemed", "10:38", "to be a punishable offense but the", "10:41", "outraged mob is it was fully invested in", "10:44", "this kind of outrage reasoning to to", "10:47", "tear down the president over this and", "10:48", "it's just it just feels so unnecessary I", "10:50", "mean oh it's right it's why I wrote this", "10:52", "book but the book is about outrage", "10:54", "culture an hour an hour like this sort", "10:56", "of weird new cultural need to just go", "11:00", "after each other in the worst of ways it", "11:03", "is there's a new ability to do that I", "11:05", "mean this is what is with these new to", "11:06", "that people have through social media", "11:07", "and through making these viral video", "11:11", "clips which is what each reporter is", "11:13", "hoping is they're going to accomplish by", "11:15", "being combative with the President and", "11:17", "trying to catch him on something they're", "11:18", "hoping that they're going to create this", "11:20", "viral video that's gonna accelerate", "11:21", "their career it's it's very self", "11:24", "aggrandizing it's and it's disturbing", "11:26", "that there's there's not someone who", "11:29", "stands out that does these sort of press", "11:32", "junkets that doesn't do that yeah and I", "11:35", "actually write about that exact point in", "11:37", "my book like this what we've begun to do", "11:40", "is reward this sort of I would say", "11:45", "overly passionate emotional behavior so", "11:48", "we've replaced sophisticated reasoning", "11:51", "with outrage you know we we've started", "11:54", "to change who we actually view as heroes", "11:56", "this is how I describe it we all have", "11:57", "hero archetypes okay and like and we", "12:00", "grew up this way and there's there's", "12:02", "like fictional characters like the Jedi", "12:03", "like it so that's like a hero archetype", "12:05", "or Superman we kind of look up to this", "12:07", "person or or like or like real", "12:10", "characters like Rosa Parks or Jesus like", "12:13", "there's there's people that we actually", "12:14", "look up to and we identify with and", "12:16", "there's certain attributes that we use", "12:18", "and we say I want to be like that and so", "12:20", "when I act in public I'm going to I'm", "12:23", "going to I'm going to access that", "12:24", "attribute I'm gonna be better and", "12:26", "according according to that archetype", "12:28", "and we sort of turn that on its head", "12:31", "and in our in our current outrage pop", "12:33", "culture like we see somebody who plays", "12:34", "the victim and we cheer them on", "12:37", "well reality what we used to do is see", "12:39", "somebody who overcame adversity who was", "12:41", "the true hero and then we cheered them", "12:42", "on we've totally reversed that yeah and", "12:45", "like so and so until you actually get", "12:47", "more points if yours more snarky if", "12:50", "you're meaner if you're if you're if", "12:52", "you're playing this kind of cheap-shot", "12:53", "game and like in my book I use this", "12:55", "example of like these is this group of", "12:58", "veterans they they were waiting for me", "12:59", "at my office I was going and I knew", "13:05", "something was off because veterans my", "13:06", "age they we never we're the like the", "13:09", "ballcap you know looking with the gold", "13:10", "letters that say veteran on it we never", "13:12", "wear that but these guys were wearing", "13:13", "that so that was that was my first sign", "13:15", "that something was different about these", "13:16", "guys but they just asked for a picture", "13:17", "and I figured that was it no we'd keep", "13:19", "going", "13:20", "but uh the second thing that was off was", "13:22", "like they they weren't they weren't", "13:25", "looking at the camera", "13:26", "they were fiddling as I was like posing", "13:28", "for this camera for this photo and I", "13:30", "thought that was strange and it turns", "13:32", "out they were just getting their own", "13:33", "video camera ready to record and then", "13:34", "they start following me and like just go", "13:36", "nuts like they lose their minds", "13:38", "I'm talking about Trump and you know", "13:41", "betraying the country and just all this", "13:43", "nonsense and so they were just trying to", "13:46", "have a gotcha moment with you yeah yeah", "13:48", "yeah this is what they do they're", "13:50", "they're an activist group and they'll", "13:51", "corner people like me and try and get", "13:53", "like a viral video going and and then", "13:56", "you know it's up to me at that point to", "13:57", "just like understand what's happening it", "13:59", "just kind of walks silently and I kind", "14:01", "of engage with them and some funny ways", "14:02", "but they were they were becoming", "14:03", "extremely emotional I mean their voices", "14:05", "started to crack it was which was you", "14:07", "know and what are they saying about you", "14:10", "or to you how could you how could you", "14:13", "let how could you betray the country by", "14:15", "supporting the president I mean things", "14:17", "like that it mostly sloganeering like", "14:19", "this wasn't a like a deep conversation", "14:20", "by any means but but that's the point", "14:23", "the point is is that they're rewarded", "14:25", "for that like overly emotional in motion", "14:29", "like you know filming while while", "14:31", "walking type of type of scenario and", "14:33", "then they like and then there's this", "14:35", "whole deal where I have to get in the", "14:37", "elevator because that's how I get to the", "14:38", "votes like I I leave my my office on the", "14:41", "fourth floor and Canon I take the", "14:43", "elevator down in the basement I walk", "14:44", "across like that's just my route and so", "14:47", "but what they do is as I

are", "30:38", "ways to do that but the thing has to", "30:40", "exist before you can afford it it has to", "30:42", "actually exist can I pause you for a", "30:45", "second then how do you implement that", "30:47", "without making putting a cap on the", "30:51", "amount that a drug can cost I mean how", "30:54", "do you make it more affordable well so", "30:57", "like well there's other bills

"31:10", "okay well once that patent ends what", "31:11", "happens is some pharmaceutical companies", "31:13", "do take advantage of the system and", "31:15", "maybe they continue to put out

a", "36:53", "hundred dollars for add the reason why", "36:55", "you would say that things shouldn't cost", "36:57", "too much for someone who's injured or", "36:59", "sick is because we want to take

to", "37:17", "make sure that if someone's sick or", "37:19", "injured and something's wrong that we", "37:21", "can take care of that we would like", "37:23", "everybody to do their share and we would", "37:25", "like everybody to chip in so that this", "37:28", "is possible but there's a big difference", "37:29", "between that and fixing the price on an", "37:32", "ad well no but not economically there's", "37:35", "no difference morally there is and I", "37:37", "agree with you morally we do have the we", "37:39", "have the same goal of getting everybody", "37:41", "out of quick care right but standpoint", "37:43", "but from an economic standpoint my point", "37:46", "still stands and you can apply that to", "37:48", "any industry I see what you're saying", "37:49", "but I think we're looking", "37:50", "the medical care is a basic human right", "37:53", "instead of just an economic issue the", "37:56", "reason I don't describe it is it it's", "37:59", "not in your

in other countries it's why", "38:11", "as we compare ourselves to other", "38:12", "countries right now all these places", "38:14", "with socialized medicine it's it's", "38:16", "important to look at some stats and", "38:17", "actually I have them here I could take", "38:19", "the time to pick them up but I'll but", "38:20", "all but I'll give you the bottom line up", "38:22", "front we have overwhelmingly per capita", "38:26", "more ICU beds in this country than any", "38:28", "other Western country overwhelmingly per", "38:32", "capita we have more ventilators than any", "38:35", "of these other people we're all we're", "38:36", "all freaking out right now because we're", "38:37", "worried about our ventilators and in our", "38:39", "ICU beds on a per capita basis our", "38:42", "system has way way more than the UK then", "38:46", "Italy than Spain and Germany all of them", "38:48", "like like orders of magnitude more okay", "38:51", "so okay also we're the ones who innovate", "38:55", "I mean the vast majority of research and", "38:57", "development new drugs that come out that", "38:58", "comes from this country so these are", "39:00", "these are facts that we can't escape if", "39:02", "we do price controls and", "39:04", "medicare-for-all is fundamentally a", "39:05", "system of price controls if we do that", "39:08", "economically speaking we absolutely will", "39:10", "reduce supply I understand the moral", "39:13", "argument you're making which is we still", "39:15", "want to help people yes we should we", "39:16", "should be looking for the ways to do", "39:18", "that but I want to be able to do that in", "39:20", "a way that doesn't undercut the", "39:22", "foundations of the good parts of our", "39:24", "healthcare system which is quality and", "39:26", "innovation if we undercut those things", "39:28", "we're the last country doing this we're", "39:30", "the last country in the world and truly", "39:32", "doing innovation the world is left out", "39:35", "to dry", "39:36", "see there the this what you're saying", "39:38", "makes a lot of sense is there a way to", "39:40", "do both is there a way to provide health", "39:43", "care to everyone but also encourage this", "39:45", "innovation encourage profit so you", "39:47", "encourage these companies to do all", "39:50", "these great things that you're", "39:51", "describing and and and maintain this", "39:53", "incredibly high level of healthcare that", "39:55", "we have right now that's certainly the", "39:57", "goal right and that that should be the", "39:59", "goal and this is why I think there's", "40:00", "there's got to be room for compromise on", "40:02", "the healthcare debate because you", "40:04", "can't compromise with the other party if", "40:06", "the goals aren't the same like I've come", "40:08", "to believe that our goals on immigration", "40:09", "are actually not the same okay so it's", "40:11", "hard to compromise on health care they", "40:12", "should be the same like because we we we", "40:14", "want everybody to have access to quality", "40:17", "health care now they have a very", "40:18", "different way of getting to that point", "40:20", "we have probably a much more complicated", "40:22", "we recognize how difficult it is to get", "40:24", "to that point while also ensuring that", "40:26", "we maintain quality and an innovation", "40:29", "and so what I'm working on personally is", "40:33", "is the primary care side of things", "40:35", "okay so primary care doctor is your", "40:37", "that's your first point of contact in", "40:39", "health care and the system that I think", "40:42", "works best for that is direct primary", "40:43", "care so direct primary care basically", "40:45", "means that you Joe you're a doctor you", "40:49", "can handle about 250 300 patients at a", "40:52", "time they all pay you a subscription fee", "40:54", "of about $75 a month and they have full", "40:57", "access to you so it's like less than a", "40:59", "cell phone bill this already exists this", "41:01", "model is prevalent it's growing I would", "41:03", "like to see it grow much faster okay how", "41:05", "do you do that well we can't subsidize", "41:07", "lower income people in order to do that", "41:10", "how we do that is very complicated", "41:11", "that's what I'm working out and within", "41:14", "our complicated system but that's an", "41:16", "idea to one make that free market model", "41:20", "actually take off so that people who", "41:22", "don't need help with their healthcare", "41:23", "costs like like you and me we can still", "41:25", "afford that just like we afford any", "41:27", "other monthly cost and you have access", "41:29", "to preventive medicine you have access", "41:31", "to telemedicine you actually have a", "41:33", "doctor-patient relationship that makes", "41:35", "it a lot easier to start solving the", "41:37", "rest of the problem making our insurance", "41:40", "market more competitive making putting", "41:42", "more choice in it directly subsidizing", "41:44", "those who need it but in a way that", "41:46", "looks a lot more like Medicare Advantage", "41:47", "so Medicare Advantage is a part of", "41:49", "Medicare that basically forces", "41:51", "competition and choice between insurance", "41:53", "companies it came out to be a lot", "41:55", "cheaper than we originally thought it", "41:57", "would in the early 2000s when when this", "41:59", "thing was created this was a Republican", "42:00", "plan because there's certain foundations", "42:03", "that I think we have to adhere to any", "42:05", "time we want to problem solve choice and", "42:07", "competition are among them you you can't", "42:09", "escape those things and I think when we", "42:11", "talk about Medicare for all it tries to", "42:14", "it tries to move past these essential", "42:17", "foundation and", "42:18", "whether of a free society that we have", "42:21", "to adhere to and and because the other", "42:26", "thing I I push back on a little bit is", "42:28", "the health care as a right statement and", "42:32", "I push back against that because with", "42:34", "that when you're calling something a", "42:36", "right what you're effectively saying is", "42:38", "that somebody else has a obligation to", "42:41", "serve you and it's hard to call", "42:43", "something a right when that right", "42:44", "requires the service of somebody else", "42:46", "don't make picky don't we already do", "42:48", "that with the firemen don't we do that", "42:50", "with the police department don't we do", "42:52", "that with public schools not exactly no", "42:56", "I mean we have public services that I", "42:58", "would I would distinguish those public", "43:00", "services from something like a Rex", "43:04", "quantum of care and I would distinguish", "43:06", "them to an enormous extent like but you", "43:08", "and here's why you can add a few hundred", "43:10", "thousand more people to a you know to to", "43:13", "the nation's population and it doesn't", "43:16", "change the mission of the military right", "43:18", "like it doesn't it doesn't take an away", "43:19", "thing away from them but these but", "43:22", "because of this sort of non-rival ii and", "43:27", "economics term but the sort of non-rival", "43:30", "attribute of these things it is", "43:32", "different right because there's only a", "43:34", "select number of doctors and we've", "43:35", "already said that once you put price", "43:36", "controls in there's going to be less", "43:37", "doctors because doctors will be paid", "43:39", "less they'll get burned out more they'll", "43:42", "then Possible's will be able to actually", "43:44", "never finish that point the reason price", "43:47", "controls reduce supply and we reason we", "43:49", "see supply reductions in other countries", "43:51", "is because well hospitals don't get the", "43:53", "same amount of money they're not going", "43:54", "to invest in that extra ICU but they're", "43:56", "not going to buy those extra ventilators", "43:58", "they're not going to hire those other", "43:59", "doctors a doctor doesn't want to be a", "44:01", "doctor because they don't make the", "44:02", "amount of money that they thought they", "44:03", "would make they're doing extra work", "44:05", "because there's more people who now have", "44:07", "access to them but there's less of them", "44:10", "so wait lines are huge and then and", "44:12", "they're seeing multiple more patients a", "44:14", "day doctor burnout increases quite a bit", "44:16", "that's the quick answer as to why why", "44:18", "that happens but does that kind of", "44:21", "answer your question it's getting really", "44:23", "that does yeah the human right issue we", "44:26", "we kind of moved around with that this", "44:29", "the the idea that it's different than", "44:31", "the fire department or", "44:32", "police department or well it's not a", "44:34", "right either actually the the fire", "44:36", "department is not necessarily a a right", "44:38", "as we would but it's a public service", "44:41", "that's provided to everyone now it is", "44:44", "but it but understand so let's call it a", "44:47", "public service then and let's call", "44:48", "doctor healthcare a public service okay", "44:50", "well if we were to do medicare for all", "44:52", "but wouldn't the result be the same if", "44:53", "it's provided for everyone", "44:56", "not from a practical standpoint just", "44:58", "because it's much easier again you could", "45:00", "add a hundred thousand people more to", "45:01", "your city and the fire department would", "45:03", "have marginally more more work to do you", "45:06", "know compared to like a doctor for", "45:09", "instance does that make sense like you", "45:11", "just it doesn't I think on a if you're", "45:13", "trying to compare them in that sense", "45:15", "that that non-rival attributes matter it", "45:20", "matters quite a bit if I'm describing", "45:22", "that so what you're saying is because", "45:25", "competition is necessary with medical", "45:28", "innovation and also like doctors profit", "45:32", "off of being exceptional so you you they", "45:35", "have incentive to being exceptional no", "45:39", "no what I'm saying is if you have if you", "45:41", "have ten doctors that's that are serving", "45:43", "a community every time that doctor is", "45:46", "serving somebody it means somebody else", "45:48", "can't see them well isn't that just as a", "45:50", "signal that we need more doctors and", "45:52", "more hospitals it is their understanding", "45:54", "it it would be yes but I'm saying that's", "45:58", "how it's different from a fire", "45:59", "department which is sort of lying in", "46:01", "wait for a fire to occur well if there", "46:03", "was more fires", "46:04", "yeah but it is unlikely most of the time", "46:07", "I'm just I'm trying I'm trying to", "46:09", "distinguish why those why those aren't", "46:11", "very comparable things like what why one", "46:14", "is more of a public service that that we", "46:17", "see to work well while the other", "46:19", "wouldn't necessarily be in friction and", "46:21", "you kind of just said it yourself it", "46:23", "would be a signal for there to be more", "46:25", "doctors which is why the free market", "46:28", "price price points are so important", "46:31", "because the only way to signal that is", "46:34", "to actually that demand raises prices", "46:38", "when the government tries to do that now", "46:40", "there's this theory of the socialist", "46:42", "that they would say the government can", "46:44", "just figure that out", "46:46", "I would say that they've tried that in", "46:48", "the past it never works it never it just", "46:50", "it never ever works the government can't", "46:52", "possibly be so omniscient as to know", "46:55", "every single price signal and and", "46:57", "anticipate every single piece of demand", "47:00", "and production that is therefore", "47:02", "required and so you know it's not just", "47:03", "healthcare that this is a problem it's", "47:05", "it's every aspect of society so if I can", "47:07", "go back to what you're saying earlier", "47:09", "you so what you're essentially saying", "47:11", "about socialism that socialism looks at", "47:14", "this problem it says hey let's make the", "47:16", "government take care of everything let's", "47:18", "take money from the wealthy people and", "47:20", "pour it into the government and that the", "47:22", "government will then have resources take", "47:23", "care of these issues and you'll you're", "47:26", "just looking at the first step of the", "47:27", "problem you're not looking at the", "47:29", "secondary or tertiary the instances or", "47:33", "things that are going to go sideways", "47:34", "once you do implement that first step is", "47:37", "that we're saying it's a hundred percent", "47:40", "what I'm saying I would I would add", "47:42", "social needs out some very important", "47:44", "things like like human nature for", "47:47", "instance and and this the this notion", "47:51", "that we need incentives socialism", "47:54", "doesn't believe and incentives doesn't", "47:57", "believe that we need incentive to do", "47:59", "things there's there's this there's this", "48:00", "utopian belief among the most hard-core", "48:05", "socialist that that humans will act in", "48:08", "this in this kind of philanthropic", "48:10", "manner no matter what like we're going", "48:12", "to do the most amount of work even if", "48:14", "that reward is is overwhelmingly taken", "48:16", "away from us and redistributed but of", "48:17", "course that's not how it would actually", "48:18", "function in reality yeah you would start", "48:21", "to you it just wouldn't right and so", "48:24", "you're now maybe for a few people a few", "48:25", "altruistic people would be the ones you", "48:27", "know doing all the work while everybody", "48:29", "else is like pretending to work which", "48:31", "was it happened in the Soviet Union you", "48:32", "pretend to pay us we'll pretend to work", "48:34", "right look that was the saying from the", "48:36", "Soviet Union that's I I think we", "48:39", "intuitively understand that and and and", "48:41", "and when that happened again the same", "48:42", "thing with Medicare for all if you're if", "48:44", "you have price controls your incentives", "48:46", "change and if we're if we're not really", "48:49", "serious about understanding that aspect", "48:51", "of these of these policies then we're", "48:55", "not thinking through them correctly and", "48:56", "I don't understand a lot of Democrats", "48:58", "would say well it's Medicare for all", "48:59", "it's not", "49:00", "socialism and I'm like yeah but it but", "49:02", "it has very socialistic tendencies and", "49:04", "it has these qualities that I've", "49:06", "described of not taking into account the", "49:08", "second third order effects of removing", "49:10", "human incentive of of forcing somebody's", "49:15", "services and because you're calling it a", "49:17", "right which means that you now have a", "49:19", "right to somebody else's services like", "49:20", "these are these are things that have", "49:23", "been proven not to work and and I think", "49:26", "we and I think we have to understand", "49:28", "that as we try to move towards the", "49:30", "mutual goal of getting everybody access", "49:32", "to health care", "49:33", "well it doesn't with everything but it", "49:35", "doesn't that work with the fire", "49:37", "department isn't the fire department in", "49:39", "a lot of ways a socialist institution no", "49:43", "no I again I still say it is not because", "49:46", "it is not under any obligation to serve", "49:49", "everybody that that demands its service", "49:52", "right it's therefore specific emergency", "49:54", "service as a as a public good but it's", "49:57", "there for fire if there's a fire they", "49:59", "come in and help you there's not a", "50:02", "financial incentive for them to do so", "50:06", "right but I mean but but on a practical", "50:09", "level on a practical level though", "50:11", "imagine the scaling that has to occur if", "50:14", "you're if you're doing that with medical", "50:16", "with medical care and I and I think", "50:18", "that's and I think that's the difference", "50:20", "with from an economic point and a", "50:22", "practical standpoint right so we're", "50:23", "talking about over what you're talking", "50:24", "about socialism overall not just over", "50:27", "I'm not just involving medicine you're", "50:29", "talking about socialism in general and", "50:30", "I'm saying isn't the fire department and", "50:32",

there's a", "55:10", "cost to it and it's a hell of a lot more", "55:12", "than the fire department and police", "55:13", "department the cost by by most estimates", "55:17", "is in the mid

my taxes I mean some people will", "56:16", "say that I don't actually believe them I", "56:17", "I bet once they got their taxes they", "56:20", "would totally change their mind but", "56:21", "let's

how do you get", "57:09", "people care well the main problem we", "57:11", "have with health care in this country is", "57:14", "that it cost too much that's", "57:15", "fundamentally the problem it is too", "57:18", "costly and so from the Republican side", "57:22", "what we'd rather do is actually target", "57:24", "the source of the problem make it easier", "57:26", "to get insurance cuz right now I mean", "57:28", "you know it's for so many Americans that", "57:32", "insurance is just too expensive if you", "57:34", "have it through your employer it's", "57:35", "usually pretty good people are pretty", "57:37", "happy with that but for the most part", "57:39", "it's too expensive which is why I go", "57:40", "back to my direct primary care idea", "57:41", "because once you hit once you solve the", "57:43", "direct primary the primary care issue", "57:45", "you make solving insurance much easier", "57:48", "you can talk then you can still protect", "57:49", "people for existing

improvements to the system that", "58:01", "make it affordable for people and get", "58:03", "people off access that they need well I", "58:07", "read of that sorry Brooke up there for a", "58:10", "second this whole connection of doing", "58:12", "things remotely sucks what did you can", "58:15", "you say that last night statement again", "58:17", "just still the last few words you said", "58:21", "you were talking about surance here's my", "58:24", "question yeah the whole thing like", "58:25", "insurance still has to pay for it then", "58:27", "it's still paying someone's still paying", "58:30", "for all this health care if the", "58:32", "insurance companies aren't making any", "58:33", "profit cuz they're paying for all the", "58:34", "health care then what happens then do we", "58:37", "fund the insurance companies I mean how", "58:39", "does all this stuff get evened out are", "58:42", "you referring to cases where you know", "58:45", "that the cost of somebody's care is so", "58:47", "astronomically expensive that even the", "58:49", "insurance company can't afford it well", "58:51", "look here's the problem right people", "58:53", "can't afford health care so we get them", "58:55", "insurance insurance takes care of health", "58:57", "care how did the insurance companies", "58:58", "make any money then well I mean they", "59:02", "make a profit just like just like", "59:03", "anybody else but but they're also that", "59:06", "they're they're also what we found is", "59:08", "especially with our experiments with", "59:09", "Medicare Advantage is when you pit", "59:11", "insurance companies against each other", "59:12", "in a in a free market they lower costs", "59:16", "you know they they are a natural there's", "59:20", "different there's different elements of", "59:21", "the health care system on one side is", "59:25", "driving up costs you know because the", "59:26", "doctor wants to keep doing more tests or", "59:27", "whatever it is or where a patient wants", "59:29", "to do more things the insurance", "59:31", "company's job is to say hold on a second", "59:34", "why are you doing this what is the", "59:36", "reason for this what's the outcome that", "59:37", "we expect from this so that naturally", "59:40", "drives that's that's a natural you know", "59:43", "bulwark against higher costs the", "59:46", "government was in a medicare-for-all", "59:47", "scheme the government would simply", "59:49", "replace that insurance company we we", "59:52", "should be very careful when assuming", "59:53", "that the government will somehow be", "59:55", "better at that than insurance companies", "59:57", "I'm not saying since companies are great", "59:58", "at all everybody doesn't seem to like", "60:00", "them but I also don't want the", "60:03", "government doing it I don't want to be", "60:04", "in a case like in Great Britain where", "60:06", "where the government will say you know", "60:09", "what your", "60:09", "Grandad's not on the ventilator anymore", "60:11", "we're done with that or your baby can't", "60:13", "get that care I mean we've all seen", "60:14", "these stories and we don't have that", "60:17", "issue in America but can I pause you", "60:20", "don't we have a problem with insurance", "60:22", "companies not want to pay for certain", "60:23", "things they might but they still but the", "60:27", "care still happens the hospital has to", "60:29", "eat that care a lot and there's there's", "60:31", "different funding mechanisms that", "60:33", "reimburse them yeah we have a really I'm", "60:35", "not defending our health care system I", "60:37", "want to be clear about that it's", "60:38", "definitely not perfect it's a huge", "60:39", "patchwork but no that doesn't that not", "60:43", "the way it happens over there because", "60:44", "over there like in Great Britain if you", "60:46", "actually nationalize the health care", "60:48", "system the way they do its when they say", "60:51", "you're not going to be on the ventilator", "60:52", "anymore there's no choice like that's", "60:55", "that that is that is the decision and", "60:58", "then that's what they have to deal with", "60:59", "and so it's it is different but don't", "61:02", "they have some private health care over", "61:04", "there as well I think they might have", "61:06", "elements of it and same with Canada but", "61:08", "but but not for basic care like so you", "61:11", "can eat fur for other kinds of health", "61:13", "care surgery sorry leo", "61:15", "yeah like elective stuff orthopedic", "61:17", "surgeries yeah and I'd have to really", "61:20", "get some details for you on what each", "61:21", "country does but it's it's it's limited", "61:24", "they limit what they can actually do I", "61:25", "don't want to get bogged down too much", "61:27", "in socialism but one of the things that", "61:28", "you said you said socialism has been", "61:30", "implemented before but it's never really", "61:32", "been implemented here right thank God", "61:36", "but this is what I was saying before", "61:39", "that I think that when people look at it", "61:42", "as an attractive notion one of the", "61:45", "things that attracts them to it is that", "61:46", "our system doesn't work that great and", "61:48", "that maybe this would be a system that", "61:50", "does serve people and there's a bunch of", "61:52", "buzz words and people use you know", "61:54", "wealth disparity economically", "61:57", "disadvantaged you know the working class", "61:59", "all these different these are words that", "62:01", "they use that this is maybe maybe", "62:04", "socialism would benefit those people and", "62:06", "there's more of them than there are the", "62:07", "elite and what do you say to that I", "62:12", "would say that there has been times in", "62:14", "this country where we had astronomical", "62:16", "tax rates and higher government control", "62:19", "and some things and we ended up with", "62:22", "skyrocketing inflation", "62:23", "and downward growth so I'm talking about", "62:26", "the 70s and the when Reagan came to", "62:29", "power we reversed a lot of that and", "62:31", "we've been in a pretty good good trend", "62:35", "ever since I I know that what I know", "62:39", "what people are saying and you repeated", "62:40", "it which is our system doesn't work well", "62:43", "well I want to actually want to push", "62:45", "back against the premise that our system", "62:47", "doesn't work the evidence for that is", "62:50", "not great I mean I think there's a lot", "62:53", "more evidence to suggest that we live in", "62:55", "the best time in modern history in", "62:57", "history in modern times it's it's hard", "63:00", "it's hard to argue otherwise so I would", "63:02", "agree there are certain there's I mean", "63:05", "there's certain problems that people", "63:07", "point to especially Millennials my", "63:08", "people my age housing is it is more", "63:11", "expensive our purchasing power isn't as", "63:13", "good with say things like housing and", "63:15", "health care these are true statements it", "63:18", "also depends on where you live the", "63:19", "problem Joe is people are identifying", "63:23", "issues they're not putting them into", "63:25", "context in perspective but even if the", "63:28", "right about the issues like hey our", "63:30", "purchasing power is lower with respect", "63:31", "to housing and health care two very", "63:33", "important things people are", "63:35", "misunderstanding why that is people", "63:37", "forgot to ask the question why is it why", "63:39", "is it that I can't afford this people", "63:41", "are instead jumping to a solution that", "63:43", "is frankly very shallow and simple which", "63:46", "is make housing cheaper make healthcare", "63:48", "cheaper how write a law say it's cheaper", "63:51", "well no that's not how it works we can't", "63:53", "just do that we have to first ask the", "63:55", "question like why did this happen so in", "63:57", "California let's talk about housing for", "63:58", "a second California and Texas don't have", "64:00", "the same problems and housing in Texas", "64:03", "is much easier to come by than it is in", "64:04", "California why is that well as it turns", "64:08", "out we don't have zoning here in Houston", "64:10", "you can build where you want to build", "64:12", "it's a much easier I talk to developers", "64:14", "who who develop here and develop", "64:15", "sometimes in California it's like four", "64:17", "times more expensive to develop because", "64:19", "of all the regulations in California", "64:21", "which means the housing itself is going", "64:23", "to be more expensive so what is it", "64:25", "government too much government control", "64:27", "frankly in San Francisco you can't build", "64:30", "anything else they don't allow building", "64:31", "high-rises full of apartment building so", "64:33", "it's no surprise that the supply is too", "64:35", "constricted and prices have to go", "64:37", "for the limp the intense amount of", "64:39", "demand that's out there we don't have", "64:41", "those same problems in Texas okay so", "64:43", "again it's like why is this happening", "64:45", "same with health care health care is not", "64:46", "a free market hasn't been and basically", "64:49", "forever and prices have gone up as a", "64:51", "result now health there's a lot more", "64:53", "complicated than housing and we've spent", "64:55", "a lot of time talking about it already", "64:56", "but we really have to ask ourselves why", "64:58", "something is is so expensive what we're", "65:01", "getting from that and then and then we", "65:03", "intelligently look at what are the", "65:05", "solutions to solve it California's a", "65:09", "mess in a lot of ways there's a lot of", "65:12", "problems but you really feel like the", "65:14", "the reason why San Francisco's housing I", "65:16", "mean it's gone up radically with the", "65:19", "tech boom I mean I think a lot of it is", "65:22", "supply and demand a lot of is just what", "65:24", "I mean but it's also people that have", "65:26", "ridiculous amounts of money and so the", "65:29", "wealth in San Francisco is so off the", "65:32", "charts that people are willing to buy a", "65:34", "stupid house for you know three million", "65:36", "dollars that really should be three", "65:38", "hundred thousand dollars in Texas yeah I", "65:43", "agree with you it is a supply and demand", "65:45", "issue and the supply hasn't caught up", "65:47", "with the demand that that's not that's", "65:48", "what I'm saying is like the the", "65:50", "government won't allow more supplies to", "65:52", "be built well the city to those yeah", "65:56", "that's fair but that's a and that's", "65:58", "totally fair and as a as a city people", "66:01", "in San Francisco might just decide we", "66:03", "don't want anybody else living here and", "66:04", "we don't want to build anything out but", "66:05", "what's weird they have no problem with", "66:08", "homeless people I mean the homeless", "66:12", "we've been to San Francisco I it's been", "66:17", "a while but but I have been there quite", "66:18", "a number of times and I was gonna say", "66:19", "like I spent ten years in San Diego San", "66:21", "Diego doesn't have these no well it's a", "66:23", "far more communal place and they just", "66:26", "they let big buildings get built you", "66:28", "know like I used to live in downtown San", "66:30", "Diego and when I was there it was one", "66:33", "way and now there's like 15 more", "66:37", "high-rises and the rent is basically", "66:40", "stayed the same", "66:41", "so which is good for renters it's bad", "66:43", "for owners and developers but you know", "66:45", "but the irony is like the populist kind", "66:48", "of left and right like a really mad", "66:50", "the owners and developers the owners of", "66:52", "capital right like kind of Marxist", "66:54", "screaming and yelling is all about but", "66:57", "the irony is that the policies they want", "66:59", "to implement help those people and if we", "67:01", "let more deregulation occur you're", "67:03", "helping the renters whose rent hasn't", "67:05", "changed in years and I know this like I", "67:09", "follow the market in San Diego very", "67:11", "carefully because we're still property", "67:14", "there and so I rent out to people I", "67:17", "haven't been able to I have not changed", "67:19", "the rent in years years and that's", "67:22", "because of upward supply and so again so", "67:24", "I guess my you're completely right it's", "67:26", "the supply demand issue in San Francisco", "67:28", "I thing is is like you have to choose", "67:30", "one or the other if you want prices to", "67:31", "go down you have to allow more supply if", "67:34", "you're comfortable with prices the way", "67:35", "they are and you don't want more people", "67:37", "moving into San Francisco well then fine", "67:39", "but you have to be comfortable with the", "67:40", "price is the way they aren't coming and", "67:41", "then deal with the homeless population", "67:42", "on top the homeless population is insane", "67:45", "I mean you've never seen anything like", "67:46",

you", "137:45", "look at what are the consequences of", "137:46", "allowing us to have things manufactured", "137:49", "over there what kind of karma do we take", "137:52", "on for when you look at

"139:45", "that we all have to kind of collectively", "139:47", "look at this and it's gonna take the", "139:49", "private sector as well", "139:51", "because Apple would tell you okay I'd", "139:53",

skills", "140:12", "that are necessary to engage in these", "140:14", "jobs there's a lot of technical skills", "140:16", "that we are not teaching because so this", "140:19", "gets to education
