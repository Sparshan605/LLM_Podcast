fighting and I think yeah", "02:46", "it's a poor shield in a sense you know", "02:48", "and sometimes if it hurts enough like", "02:53", "when I got my ribs cracked", "02:54", "I felt that right I can went through and", "02:57", "they like disrupted my force shield and", "02:59", "so sometimes that something would go", "03:00", "through like I saw your shield so my", "03:02", "force shield so yeah you're AB - your", "03:06", "mindset yeah this is like you're", "03:08", "fighting your you ready to accept all", "03:09", "sorts of things yeah like I could die or", "03:14", "even harder I could kill someone do you", "03:17", "think it'd be harder to kill someone", "03:18", "than to die and so where are you yeah", "03:21", "yeah because then you think about their", "03:23", "loved ones mmm so thinking about all the", "03:28", "people that loved you we fight think", "03:29", "about all the people that love you right", "03:31", "yeah and so when we fight I didn't I", "03:35", "didn't break any rules but I killed you", "03:37", "right think about all your loved ones", "03:39", "everybody that loves you that's attached", "03:41", "to you think about that all that pain", "03:46", "it's long because of what I did to you", "03:48", "right even though I didn't break any", "03:50", "rules have you ever been in a promotion", "03:52", "where someone died mm-hmm but that's", "03:56", "heavy right yeah I don't I think", "03:58", "probably why a lot of Fighters", "04:02", "I I have noticed like there's there's I", "04:05", "don't think the majority of fighters", "04:08", "look at what they do with the gravity", "04:11", "that that it deserves", "04:14", "hmm you know like you could kill", "04:16", "somebody like you need to think about", "04:18", "that and be okay with that not okay but", "04:21", "just understand like all right that", "04:24", "could happen and I'm gonna be cut", "04:26", "I'm consciously knowing this and", "04:28", "choosing to go forward they just think", "04:31", "oh I'm gonna fight it'll be fun it'll", "04:32", "you know whatever or it'll be hard or", "04:34", "I'm gonna like whatever they don't think", "04:36", "about these things is this something", "04:37", "that you thought about when you were", "04:39", "young yeah before I really got into it", "04:41", "so you this is a something you've been", "04:44", "contemplating even before you started", "04:47", "fighting you were aware of all the", "04:48", "possibilities yeah I okay all right I'll", "04:54", "say it so I was um it was about 28 I", "04:57", "think and I don't think I had my pro", "05:00", "boxing debut yet", "05:02", "and I took some mushrooms and I was", "05:06", "thinking somewhere along the trip I", "05:09", "started thinking about fighting and I", "05:11", "started thinking about like what could", "05:12", "happen to me and I think I started", "05:14", "thinking about the death of me", "05:16", "and then I started thinking about what", "05:18", "could happen to my opponent like what's", "05:20", "worse than that and I thought about I", "05:22", "could see like if somebody had fight and", "05:25", "I saw all the like like lines of gold", "05:28", "thread attached into them like from", "05:31", "their loved ones and then all the lines", "05:33", "got snipped when they died yeah I saw", "05:36", "this limb this mushroom trip and I was", "05:38", "just like and so then when I decided to", "05:41", "fight there's more intense you know and", "05:45", "more commitment and more resolve that's", "05:48", "heavy", "05:49", "yeah yeah but that is what it is right", "05:53", "and that's where I think rule there's", "05:57", "more power this idea of enforced", "06:00", "equality right ensuring that there is", "06:03", "such a high emphasis played or placed on", "06:06", "a quality quality that you have the", "06:08", "equal amount of men the equal amount of", "06:10", "women and the opportunities are", "06:11", "absolutely available as much to women as", "06:14", "they are do and this is enforced", "06:15", "you know this creates an environment", "06:18", "where there's less resistance now in an", "06:21", "environment where there's less", "06:22", "resistance perhaps women don't feel as", "06:25", "compelled to say I'll show you yeah that", "06:28", "is what seems to have but this is though", "06:29", "well here's a Nicki look here's an", "06:31", "example so there are fewer women", "06:33", "mathematicians in the end the higher", "06:36", "echelon it's okay but here's something", "06:38", "interesting about math", "06:40", "medical ability first of all it's very", "06:41", "rare so that's the first thing to keep", "06:43", "in mind now it looks like if you look in", "06:45", "junior high that give mathematically", "06:48", "gifted men and males and females are", "06:51", "approximately as common now there's a", "06:52", "little bit of debate about that because", "06:54", "there is some evidence that maybe at the", "06:56", "very upper extremes there's a male", "06:58", "advantage just like there's a male", "06:59", "disadvantage at the low end because the", "07:01", "male distribution for intelligence might", "07:03", "be flatter and so that's the greater", "07:06", "marry male variability hypothesis", "07:08", "there's been papers putting that forward", "07:10", "that have been retracted as a", "07:11", "consequence of pressure from politically", "07:13", "correct people even though greater merit", "07:15", "male variability is actually quite", "07:17", "common in the animal kingdom for a", "07:19", "variety of reasons men are more", "07:20", "expendable that males are more", "07:22", "expendable in some ways or you could say", "07:24", "that males are more likely to produce to", "07:26", "pursue high-risk high-return strategies", "07:29", "you can look at it either way and it's", "07:30", "certainly possible in any case the men", "07:33", "the males in junior high who happened to", "07:35", "be mathematically gifted are less likely", "07:37", "to also be verbally gifted whereas that", "07:41", "doesn't seem to be the case for the", "07:42", "females and so if you're a male math", "07:45", "nerd then math is a pretty logical", "07:48", "pathway for you because you don't have", "07:50", "as many other options whereas if you're", "07:52", "female math nerd you have other options", "07:54", "because you're all you're less likely", "07:56", "you're more likely to also be verbally", "07:59", "gifted and so that's enough to at least", "08:01", "in principle account for some of the", "08:03", "reason why there are fewer women", "08:04", "mathematicians than men mathematicians", "08:06", "they have other options they have other", "08:08", "options and there's lots of complex", "08:10", "there's lots of complex reasons like", "08:13", "this and so we have this reflexive idea", "08:15", "and this is very much the case because", "08:17", "this is like the core idea among the", "08:19", "feminist neo-marxist types is that if", "08:23", "there's differences in outcome that's", "08:25", "that's proof of prejudice and that's", "08:28", "support for the idea of the patriarchal", "08:30", "tyranny and that's like the core axiom", "08:32", "of the radical left is the patriarchal", "08:34", "tyranny as far as I'm concerned that's", "08:36", "that's God for them the patriarchal", "08:39", "tyranny it's like well if it turns out", "08:41", "that many of these differences in", "08:43", "outcome between men and women aren't a", "08:45", "consequence of the patriarchal tyranny", "08:46", "in fact even get bigger when you reduce", "08:49", "the tyrannical aspect of the patriarchy", "08:52", "and even the patriarchal aspect", "08:53", "but then it makes that theory not only", "08:56", "wrong but opposite of the truth which is", "09:00", "the worst kind of wrong and so you know", "09:03", "if men are more likely to produce pursue", "09:06", "careers in the STEM fields which seems", "09:08", "to be the case under conditions of", "09:10", "optimal freedom for men and women then", "09:12", "that's going to drive income disparities", "09:14", "because the STEM fields pay more and", "09:15", "they pay more partly because they're", "09:17", "scalable like it's really hard to scale", "09:20", "care for people you know like if you", "09:22", "work in a daycare you're gonna care for", "09:23", "three infants you're not gonna care for", "09:25", "fifty because you can't it's not", "09:27", "scalable but if you're like a software", "09:29", "designer it's infinitely scalable and so", "09:31", "there's there's a much wider range of", "09:34", "possible of possibility for generating", "09:37", "much larger much larger income pools and", "09:41", "much larger pools of wealth you know and", "09:43", "men are also more likely to work longer", "09:45", "hours and if you work 10% longer hours", "09:47", "you make forty percent more money", "09:49", "there's a nonlinear return on that's a", "09:51", "good thing for everybody who's listening", "09:52", "to know if you have a job you want to be", "09:54", "the guy or the woman who's working that", "09:56", "extra ten percent because the return on", "09:59", "that is nonlinear so that's a really", "10:00", "useful thing to know and I don't know", "10:03", "how it got distinguished we're proud", "10:05", "boys became this evil group of people", "10:08", "and and an tyfa is the good group of", "10:11", "people now I understand that proud boy", "10:13", "proud boys were infiltrated by like", "10:16", "nationalists yes Nazi white supremacist", "10:19", "whatever it is but those were constantly", "10:21", "being disavowed by Gavin Gavin never", "10:23", "wanted any of that happening but is", "10:26", "there wow you get in though here's the", "10:28", "question because this is my you saw my", "10:30", "last comedy special this is my criticism", "10:33", "about vegans it's not that they're", "10:35", "that's anything wrong with being a vegan", "10:37", "right when you have a group where", "10:39", "anybody can join you're gonna get a", "10:41", "certain amount of fucking idiots right", "10:43", "if you have a million people for sure", "10:45", "you have a hundred thousand fucking", "10:48", "idiots there's no getting around that", "10:50", "yeah so if you have a group where", "10:52", "anybody can join and you have a million", "10:54", "people in that group you're gonna have a", "10:55", "hundred thousand fuckin it fucking", "10:57", "idiots and those people are going to", "10:59", "define your group the worst behavior in", "11:01", "the group is where people are gonna call", "11:03", "to as an example that's it I think this", "11:05", "is also a symptom of the so", "11:07", "from media era today especially with", "11:08", "Twitter because you can't express", "11:10", "yourself and explain things 140 or 280", "11:13", "characters it just takes too much time", "11:15", "so they can say oh proud boys racist", "11:18", "scumbag Nazi that's a Gavin and there", "11:21", "are always a racist scumbag Nazi yeah", "11:22", "and all sudden that's the narrative and", "11:24", "everybody keeps pushing it and that's", "11:25", "the videos of people punching little", "11:27", "skinny people oh look at these people", "11:29", "they beat up the ante fuck yeah fucking", "11:31", "assholes", "11:31", "and Gavin's an asshole yeah that's", "11:34", "that's what it comes down to I've seen", "11:36", "it presented well you ask how it starts", "11:39", "and how it grows and how you become a", "11:41", "member by buying a fucking shirt that's", "11:43", "by buying a Perry Ellis shirt and", "11:45", "opening a chapter dude there are", "11:47", "chapters worldwide you see it it's like", "11:50", "here's the be proud boys Australia", "11:53", "here's the probability's England proud", "11:54", "boys fucking Japan like it's everywhere", "11:58", "and it never was supposed to get to that", "12:01", "point and regardless of how these people", "12:04", "act it now reflects on Gavin even though", "12:08", "he wanted to hang out in a bar with a", "12:10", "few people do his public speaking", "12:13", "without being hassled and that's it and", "12:15", "and I see the way the media manipulates", "12:18", "things I've been party to it myself", "12:20", "and I've seen Gavin presented in photos", "12:24", "where you look and go holy fuck its", "12:26", "Hitler like like they get him there's", "12:28", "one picture Gavin
