they've shown is the people that", "12:48", "are in critical care are in the ICU", "12:51", "there's a large percentage in some cases", "12:54", "over 80% of them are vitamin D deficient", "12:56", "versus the people who have sufficient", "12:58", "levels of serum vitamin C vitamin D in", "13:01", "their in their body those people it's", "13:03", "less than 5% so it was four percent of", "13:06", "them that were in the ICU the people", "13:08", "with sufficient vitamin D and more than", "13:10", "80% of people with deficient and vitamin", "13:12", "D is not just a vitamin apparently", "13:14", "according to her it's actually a hormone", "13:16", "and it regulates many things in the body", "13:18", "and most people are deficient from it", "13:19", "and in the nut United States more than", "13:22", "70% of people have insufficient levels", "13:24", "of vitamin D and 29% are deficient to", "13:28", "the point where it actually can cause", "13:29", "medical issues really my doctors is like", "13:33", "take here you take this vitamin D every", "13:35", "day walk it son that's not that's way", "13:39", "the best ways the Sun it's number one", "13:41", "yeah but if you can't get in the Sun all", "13:44", "the time vitamin D supplements do work", "13:46", "you know I've seen people argue this", "13:48", "like you really the best way supplements", "13:50", "are bullshit like no they're not they're", "13:52", "there okay", "13:53", "they're just not as good as the Sun", "13:55", "don't be stupid like look I've get my", "13:57", "blood tested I take vitamins and I find", "13:59", "out what my serum levels are that it", "14:01", "works you take vitamin D you get higher", "14:02", "levels it's really simple the Sun is for", "14:04", "sure better though", "14:05", "no one's gonna argue that but for black", "14:07", "folks it's even harder because you know", "14:10", "their their bodies are designed with all", "14:11", "that melanin to observe you know they",

that", "14:50", "vitamin D and it's so important and it's", "14:53", "one of many factors that they think or", "14:55", "is that play with people to get really", "14:57", "sick from this disease
