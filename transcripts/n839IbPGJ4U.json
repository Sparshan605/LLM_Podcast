and", "27:25", "that but I was so scared and paranoid of", "27:27", "being I was I was so scared of being", "27:32", "considered anything other than a", "27:33", "comedian that I liked for years and", "27:35", "years didn't date anybody in in comedy", "27:40", "at all because are worried that if I", "27:42", "showed up to a show with a guy who you", "27:45", "know potentially was more successful", "27:46", "than me then the first thought would be", "27:49", "she's the girl who's with that guy not", "27:51", "she's the girl who's going up next not", "27:53", "just that but she's with that God", "27:55", "because of this right yeah she's always", "27:57", "gonna be the pack when in fact there's a", "27:59", "lot of people with legitimate", "28:00", "relationships of where that's not the",

"28:09", "just one of those things", "28:10", "another prejudice that you have to sort", "28:12", "of overcome like if you'll actually like", "28:14", "someone and they have a comic though", "28:16", "what the fuck do you do", "28:18", "like you say if you like someone they", "28:20", "happen to be some big-time comedian like", "28:21", "what you supposed to not like him now", "28:23", "they like you or not like him that's", "28:25", "stupid - it is stupid but I was I was I", "28:28", "was terrified of I don't know I just I", "28:32", "think it was very eager to to impress -", "28:37", "I was very eager to prove myself and", "28:39", "maybe that is partly you know being a", "28:44", "woman I as much as I didn't find it", "28:46", "harder I did find myself wanting to", "28:49", "prove any stereotype that anyone might", "28:52", "have about me wrong right I don't I", "28:55", "don't feel as much of that as like a", "28:56", "mission anymore I doesn't but I think", "28:59", "you have a

"29:14", "am i what am I wasting my time and", "29:15", "thinking about this shit for so I think", "29:18", "it's harder for chicks to develop but I", "29:20", "think once they become good and once", "29:23", "they get out there there's a lower bar", "29:27", "III don't know I I think there's I think", "29:32", "the bar is this I think the bar is the", "29:36", "same height for most good people and", "29:41", "then there's like another bar that's", "29:43", "like higher for the great you know what", "29:45", "I mean I just think like hung the bar is", "29:47", "lower for women I think it's lower for", "29:49", "people who are not as famous not as", "29:53", "successful not as established not as", "29:54", "good but I don't know if that like I", "29:58", "just I don't know I think it's I think", "30:00", "the bar is the same for men and women I", "30:01", "just think it's a there's a there's a", "30:03", "few different bars what I mean by that", "30:05", "is that I think that it's it's easier to", "30:10", "get a lot of attention early on if", "30:13", "you're good--you're woman because", "30:15", "there's not that many of them yeah sure", "30:17", "I think it's yeah I mean I would I would", "30:19", "apply that to any person who's something", "30:23", "that is rare in comedy right this", "30:26", "facility but then you have to prove", "30:29", "yourself to prove yourself I mean and", "30:32", "then I don't know I I see comedy too in", "30:34", "these there's so many different factions", "30:36", "me there's people who are so great at", "30:37", "stand-up and then as a writer somebody", "30:40", "who tries to make like you know projects", "30:43", "and wrap them around people I also see", "30:44", "so many people who I though that's not", "30:46", "my favorite

kicking him in the head and", "91:32", "knocking him out would be worth losing", "91:33", "all the money and then getting more", "91:35", "money out could you imagine he would be", "91:37", "a goddamn folk hero if they got in close", "91:39", "if they got a nose and Floyd was like", "91:42", "sucking and Jukka on the outside and he", "91:44", "threw a jab to cover up a left high kick", "91:46",

maybe there's like a", "93:51", "small percentage chance that he just", "93:54", "runs in there and clips Floyd with a big", "93:56", "shot and rocks them and then takes him", "93:58", "out I don't know what that percentage is", "94:00", "but you ask a boxing expert there's like", "94:02", "four percent five percent right that's", "94:05", "what a boxing expert would say which I'm", "94:06",

got to think of", "106:37", "it as a knockout it's like a MMA but if", "106:39", "there's a standing eight count it would", "106:40", "have given it to him there or what he", "106:42", "should have done is probably taken knee", "106:44", "Kovalev probably should have taken a", "106:46", "knee and if he took a knee then he would", "106:47", "get a ten count that is considered a", "106:50",

happens", "107:07", "be it a you know horrific judgment which", "107:10", "I think happens a lot like to allow", "107:15", "there to be another fight like it just", "107:17", "seems to be like", "107:18", "something always fucking how that's why", "107:21", "when I have a lot of people over to", "107:23", "watch boxing like I hate I hate the", "107:27", "parts of the sport that seem like it's", "107:29", "fixed because I can appreciate the fight", "107:33", "as a whole even without an outcome I", "107:34", "think Denise is fixed no not this but I", "107:37", "just mean in boxing there always seems", "107:39", "to be something something happens that", "107:42", "would make a rematch more attractive", "107:44", "right but that's just the nature of", "107:46", "competition on a big

like sports to me it's really fun but", "108:51", "when friends come over and they", "108:53", "constantly see results that they to", "108:54", "understand they're done with the sport", "108:57", "you know whereas if you liked it more", "108:58", "you can be like is that happens the", "109:01", "problem is you're people pleaser and", "109:03", "trying to get these pieces I like", "109:04", "something that you like yeah you just", "109:05", "let them let them think it's fixed I've", "109:07", "had so many conversations with guys like", "109:09", "MMA's fix man just admit it oh I don't",

probably", "109:55", "more no they're very calm and dominant", "109:58", "both sports it's just people making", "110:00", "mistakes but my point is there are going", "110:02", "to be fixed fights there's going to be", "110:04", "people that do things just like there's", "110:07", "referees in NBA apparently they get", "110:09", "busted trying to stretch games out and", "110:11", "try to call
