know", "90:33", "there was so they", "90:33", "just decided that she was guilty and", "90:35", "they were going to try to win", "90:36", "and and that's the sick thing about it", "90:38", "is that these arson cases there is no", "90:41", "there was no crime there was a tragedy", "90:43", "but no crime nobody", "90:44", "and how long did she get away from", "90:46", "colwell she was in for 17

know sorry i'm going to step on your", "91:13", "word i was just going to say that what", "91:14", "happens with a lot of these forensic", "91:15", "sciences is they work they reverse", "91:17",

you're familiar with it you", "91:26", "know", "91:27", "you know the desired outcome so you", "91:29", "confirm that bias", "91:31", "so you know they then start looking at", "91:35", "a streak from a smoke stain on the wall", "91:40", "and knowing that the theory is that", "91:44", "there was a match struck and placed", "91:47", "against the wall", "91:48", "right they will say well that's why", "91:52", "you see it the pattern that you do of", "91:54", "that stain on the wall of smoke", "91:57", "where the reality is is that there are a", "91:59", "lot of different explanations for",

don't have experience", "92:20", "with it i mean look this is a big", "92:23", "i hadn't done any bite mark cases in all", "92:25", "of my cases", "92:26", "so i actually tried to approach it with", "92:29", "an open mind", "92:30", "and i'm i'm literally stunned at what", "92:33", "i'm finding out doing", "92:34", "research for the episodes because it", "92:36", "sounds like some wacky religion", "92:39", "you know that somebody invented in their", "92:41", "house and people buy it", "92:42", "so is all this stuff still in use", "92:45", "because", "92:46", "no one has exposed the fact that it's", "92:49", "all junk science or is it because it's", "92:51", "established", "92:52", "as a part of what they accept in trials", "92:55", "and they just haven't made the", "92:56", "corrections yet because if they did", "92:58", "then they would have to accept the fact", "93:00", "that all these other convictions that", "93:01", "were based on", "93:02", "this junk science would be open to", "93:05", "reinterpretation", "93:07", "in the trailer for junk science josh", "93:08", "addresses exactly that", "93:10", "and he does it very eloquently which is", "93:13", "that along with chris fabricant who is a", "93:15", "the strategic litigation director at the", "93:18", "innocence project", "93:19", "um it was actually a post i created in", "93:21", "honor of my dad who's not with us", "93:23", "anymore", "93:24", "um or i helped to create i should say", "93:26", "and he does an incredible job", "93:28", "but basically they keep using it because", "93:30", "the precedent is there right once it's", "93:32", "and josh talks about this and maybe we", "93:34", "could even play the trailer but um", "93:36", "sure you talk play the trailer yeah can", "93:38", "we sure can we pull it up on", "93:40", "on on the podcast app yeah jamie will", "93:42", "follow as soon as he finds it", "93:43", "yeah and then that'll that'll say it", "93:45", "more eloquently than i possibly can this", "93:47", "is so fucking hard to listen to", "93:48", "and then there's shaken baby syndrome", "93:50", "which we'll be covering on junk science", "93:52", "which is", "93:53",
