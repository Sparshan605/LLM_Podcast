the amount of", "12:27", "work and time and money that we put into", "12:28", "it most of the cars that we're building", "12:30", "on the show now we're putting at least a", "12:32", "hundred grand in and sometimes as much", "12:34", "as 300 really you know I mean what", "12:36", "building everything we're building now", "12:38", "this is when the new season comes out in", "12:41", "June people gonna be amazed you know", "12:43", "we're building this kind of stuff Wow", "12:45", "and it's wicked cool are you doing that", "12:47", "in 25 days yeah fuck man just put the", "12:50", "other good

diplomatically if it weren't for", "13:04", "employees vendors and customers business", "13:06", "would be great we we we don't do a lot", "13:10", "for the the customer", "13:12", "until we've built it for ourselves and", "13:14", "then we sell it to them but as far as", "13:16", "coming in off the street we just like", "13:18", "building what we want to build honing", "13:20", "our skills and then we find a buyer", "13:22", "every once in a while I'll have God come", "13:24", "in and go look I can this is what I want", "13:27", "but I can I won't call you I won't come", "13:29", "in there with a new steering wheel you", "13:31", "know mmm like it gets that's why a lot", "13:34", "of times cars do take seven months or a", "13:36", "year because the guy that's having its", "13:38", "built is in there every other weekend Oh", "13:40", "No maybe we move this over here and", "13:42", "paint it purple yeah I get it", "13:46", "ya know it does seem like he'll be way", "13:48", "better just build it how you like it and", "13:50", "then sell it well yeah I mean it's still", "13:52", "a business decision I'm trying to build", "13:53", "it to where I think it's gonna do the", "13:55", "most you know the most money at the end", "13:57", "of the day and stay true with what's", "13:59", "going on as far as that particular car", "14:02", "and what's going on in the marketplace", "14:03", "and technology and what-have-you", "14:06", "and we do get a lot of calls where", "14:08", "people come in okay I want that exact", "14:09", "same thing you know and so we'll build", "14:12", "another one well sometimes you you do", "14:14", "buy cars and then just sell them without", "14:16", "doing anything to it right yeah that's", "14:19", "what we call our B stories you know", "14:21", "we'll buy something bring it in maybe", "14:22", "just put some wheels on it or whatever", "14:23", "but usually it's just clean it up get it", "14:25", "run and sell somebody else to dream", "14:27", "because not everybody can afford a fully", "14:29", "built car right and or they want to do", "14:31", "it themselves so we get them a good", "14:33", "project I don't think people realize how", "14:35", "much money is involved in a fully built", "14:37", "car ridiculous", "14:38", "yeah like have you ever seen those rev", "14:40", "ology Mustangs I was looking at those", "14:43", "last night it's pretty intensive build", "14:45", "really really interesting stuff this guy", "14:47", "take it's it's essentially not really a", "14:50", "Mustang I mean it's kind of licensed by", "14:53", "Ford it looks exactly like a Mustang and", "14:55", "I was all Mustang parts but he's got", "14:57", "everything new it's just brand new like", "14:59", "a brand new you know

"15:14", "350 every part of it though all the", "15:16", "fenders everything's all newly", "15:18", "fabricated it's dead we're gonna do that", "15:20", "this season to where I'm gonna build a", "15:22", "car back to original like a 60 I'm", "15:25", "excited", "15:25", "do my Stanger forgettable Camaro but if", "15:27", "there's this guy's cars to me come the", "15:29", "fuck on that is yeah beautiful well", "15:32", "we're gonna build one that never existed", "15:33", "look how pretty that goddamn thing is", "15:35", "he's killing it I want to see what one", "15:37", "of those things is like in real life", "15:39", "he's even got push-button start you know", "15:42", "its senses when you're near the the car", "15:45", "so it'll unlock for you but it's the", "15:48", "just it seems like it's super high", "15:50", "quality build to the look how fucking", "15:54", "pretty that is well the trick is is how", "15:57", "much work goes into it because yes they", "15:59", "do make these

we're using all", "25:01", "the technology we're using the", "25:02", "independent suspension we're using all", "25:03", "the sensors all the the stuff that's in", "25:05", "that brand-new vet so we're exacting", "25:08", "control as well Wow how do you adapt", "25:10", "that over to an old car like that you", "25:13", "just go through the systems we've got a", "25:16", "guy working for us now that helped us", "25:18", "run our standalone Hellcat that they", "25:21", "said couldn't be done when we were built", "25:23", "the shark cat and so he just gets the", "25:27", "whole thing and starts eliminating", "25:28", "sensors or bad inger you know and we end", "25:32", "up with all the same technology so the", "25:34", "sensors understand when a wheel spinning", "25:36", "and then they compensate with brakes or", "25:40", "horsepower brakes you know though you", "25:43", "know get your stupid the stupid light", "25:45", "you know you can't do that so we'll be", "25:48", "able to turn it all on and off just like", "25:49", "a brand-new car Oh", "25:50", "so will you have different modes like a", "25:52", "race mode Street mode like that yeah but", "25:55", "what a lot of people try to do that I", "25:57", "can't stand is they'll take the", "25:58", "something with that idea no okay I'm", "26:00", "just gonna pull the body off and cram", "26:02", "this under there and weld it together", "26:03", "and hope it works and we make everything", "26:05", "adapt to the old car still work though", "26:09", "the way it's supposed to in a brand new", "26:11", "car", "26:11", "yeah I've seen you know there's there's", "26:14", "a guy online that has on Instagram gt500", "26:18", "super SWAT he took an old gt500 body and", "26:23", "put it on", "26:24", "gt500 from a modern

actually ways to add", "26:35", "it into there but you get into the", "26:37", "narratives yeah you get into the", "26:39", "geometry and the direction of the airbag", "26:42", "so beautiful that looks oh yeah but you", "26:44", "don't want to play with the R&D of", "26:47", "trying to put an airbag into something", "26:49", "like that unless you really really know", "26:52", "what you're doing because you don't you", "26:54", "know refraction of an inch off of being", "26:56", "where it needs to be that airbag could", "26:58", "do more damage than good it it's weird", "27:00", "though because you're dealing with a", "27:01", "totally different sized body too so I", "27:03", "wonder how he's doing this", "27:06", "it's easy it doesn't sound easy but it", "27:09", "is is it really have you done that", "27:11", "before we haven't but I understand the", "27:13", "process and really it's just cut massage", "27:16", "move in move out you know because", "27:18", "there's a company called mag motors you", "27:20", "ever heard of them I don't think I have", "27:21", "go to mag motors dot-com they have what", "27:25", "they're doing is they're putting a", "27:26", "carbon-fiber body on a modern gt500 but", "27:31", "they're using a 67 like Eleanor body but", "27:34", "they're making it out of carbon fiber so", "27:37", "it's that one's gross go to the silver", "27:39", "one that white one looks just to hate", "27:41", "the body so you really know overplayed", "27:44", "how dare you it's just - it's just been", "27:47", "done so many times but who cares it's", "27:48",

looking at it's like you need", "28:06", "to get it down a little bit you know get", "28:08", "a little more actually to get a deeper", "28:09", "dish on the wheel well I think what", "28:12", "they're doing is trying to use all the", "28:14", "geometry yes of the modern car correct", "28:17", "so you end up with something looks like", "28:18", "it could go four-wheeling a little bit", "28:23", "right yeah it's not it's definitely not", "28:25", "slammed yeah in terms of looks right yes", "28:30", "I mean I'm sure the car runs and drives", "28:32", "and performs unbelievably mm-hmm but", "28:34", "it's missing a little to me it's missing", "28:36", "awesome", "28:37", "you know that company classic", "28:39", "recreations no I don't think so they do", "28:42", "they're doing similar cars like that too", "28:44", "but they're doing it you know from the", "28:46", "ground up there's a lot of people doing", "28:48", "it because it's with technology coming", "28:51", "the way that it has it's it's not as", "28:53", "hard to do as it used to be mm-hmm it's", "28:56", "still too laborious task", "28:57", "don't get me wrong but you know you can", "28:59", "make all those systems work anything see", "29:02", "a guy like you that's a car guy you look", "29:04", "at an Eleanor and you look at it like", "29:06", "it's played but a person who doesn't see", "29:09", "them
