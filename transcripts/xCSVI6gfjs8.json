waiting for someone else to", "12:33", "do something and during the meantime", "12:34", "everyone's just trying to make money a", "12:36", "lot of money yeah unfortunately it's", "12:38", "sort of what happens with endangered", "12:40", "species the the more rare becomes more", "12:42", "valuable it becomes and so there's very", "12:45", "little incentive to do the right thing", "12:48", "and you know but this is happening with", "12:50", "all the fish stocks I mean I probably", "12:52", "gave our buy run a little organization", "12:54", "called the oceanic Preservation Society", "12:55",

slowly", "13:13", "go through all the fish docks until like", "13:15", "we're you know", "13:15", "like McDonald's used to do halibut", "13:18", "now it's Pollock which is a very small", "13:21", "you know white fish from Alaska and now", "13:25", "that's been you know how to to", "13:26", "extinction so we're going through these", "13:27", "fish stocks it's you know that's", "13:28", "shifting

stopped you know handing out", "13:37", "seafood guys and now I'm trying to sort", "13:39", "of preempt it so I don't think you know", "13:42", "the big question is there's seven and a", "13:44", "half billion of us on this planet soon", "13:46", "to be ten is there enough wild animals", "13:48", "to defeat us all there isn't you know", "13:51", "you look at the biomass of mammals on",

"14:03", "know so we can't all be eating wild fish", "14:05", "you know we think about that you know", "14:07", "you never go out and say look let's get", "14:09", "some land food they say you know we we", "14:12", "commodified you know see how that is", "14:14", "interesting right you know say land food", "14:16", "that's a really good point you know they", "14:18", "did at the turn of the century I mean", "14:20", "during the late 1800s rather there was", "14:24", "market hunting and North America and a", "14:26", "lot of the soldiers were done with world", "14:28", "with the civil war rather they were", "14:32", "hunting and they hunted all the deer the", "14:35", "bear the antelope the Buffalo and they", "14:38", "got down to like incredibly low numbers", "14:41", "you know elk to this day I think are", "14:43", "only in 10% of their original range that", "14:46", "that they were at in the 1700s and that", "14:49", "was all from market hunting from people", "14:52", "just going out buying you know meat from", "14:55", "these market hunters that have shot", "14:57", "these things and they didn't really have", "14:58", "refrigeration back then so it wasn't", "15:00", "like they could freeze it and store it", "15:01", "and they got down to these incredibly", "15:04", "low levels until Teddy Roosevelt and a", "15:07", "lot of other people that were", "15:08", "conservation minded realize like what", "15:11", "was happening here and they put a stop", "15:12", "to it all and then started enacting", "15:15", "programs to reintroduce these animals to", "15:17", "the the areas where their extirpated and", "15:19", "now you see historic levels of", "15:22", "especially white-tailed deer there's", "15:23", "more whitetail deer in America now than", "15:25", "were when Columbus landed", "15:27", "so so but that's Ben's except but it's", "15:30", "also that's a weird one too because", "15:31", "white-tailed deer almost a farm animal", "15:34", "because there's so many of them that", "15:36", "exist in Iowa and Kansas and around", "15:39", "farmlands like they literally exist in", "15:43", "fields and a lot of them live off of GMO", "15:46", "crops that's very strange", "15:48", "so like I have a buddy mine my friend", "15:50", "Doug doctorin who has this huge piece of", "15:54", "land in Wisconsin and he's like the deer", "15:57", "in my area are essentially eating these", "16:00", "GMO corn they're eating Monsanto corn", "16:03", "like this is so weird like the yeah", "16:06", "they're wild but they're also kind of", "16:08", "farm animals

it", "26:13", "would or there was a Caribbean but it's", "26:16", "pretty remote you have to get out", "26:17", "several miles to at the Great Barrier", "26:20", "Reef and it's if the further north you", "26:21", "go the more isolated as we went the", "26:24", "entire length of the Great Barrier Reef", "26:25", "and it didn't look it got slightly", "26:27", "better as you got north but there's

because", "27:48", "we're seeing it disappear in our watch", "27:50", "and that's what I'm trying to do is try", "27:52", "to not just create the awareness that", "27:54", "something's going on that we have to do", "27:56", "something but try to create action now", "27:59", "when you say semi treated sewage what do", "28:01", "you mean by that well that's that's what", "28:04", "they reported so it's it it smells like", "28:06", "sewage it smells like crap but if you if", "28:09", "you go to the website it says it's just", "28:10", "semi treated I don't know they they're", "28:12", "not you know putting it through the", "28:13", "aerators they're not going through the", "28:14", "whole system but it smells like shit to", "28:17", "me you know you come out of the water", "28:20", "and

you", "28:55", "were on the beach and you saw what was", "28:56", "going on there you wouldn't be sending", "28:57", "your kids Sarah you wouldn't be going to", "28:59", "Florida if you knew what was

can't imagine that", "29:09", "they would allow this and that I mean", "29:12", "how much more would it cost to treat it", "29:14", "versus semi treated how much more would", "29:16", "it cost", "29:16", "I don't know it's not let's do what", "29:18", "they're doing so good question saying", "29:21", "and then they that they close the beach", "29:23", "when the when the water shifts and the", "29:25", "wind shifts and heads towards the shore", "29:27", "and people get sick and they probably", "29:29", "don't even house Christ yeah I mean you", "29:31", "know we'd be out that when we were out", "29:33", "one out fall day that's what the calming", "29:35", "out fall is basically a sewer pipe you", "29:36", "know nothing's happening and all of a", "29:38", "sudden a destroyer to hear this Rumble", "29:39", "and then you see oh just this green Oh", "29:42", "God and it's in it we're not talking", "29:44", "like a little drain pipe to like", "29:46", "literally you could swim through it not", "29:47", "stand in it that it's big like four feet", "29:50", "five feet tall now why I mean why are", "29:52", "they allowing I mean does anybody have", "29:54", "an argument for why that's money money", "29:56", "matters cause because less it might cost", "29:58", "money to treat sewage Jesus Christ", "30:01", "though that's insane well there's a lot", "30:04", "of things like that but it seems like", "30:05", "someone someone should be held", "30:07", "accountable for that like whatever it", "30:09", "caught cost-benefit that they've decided", "30:13", "is worth polluting the ocean by pumping", "30:15", "sewage into it well you know that's a", "30:18", "good question when we did - now that I", "30:20", "recall this is like five years ago we", "30:21", "tried to get an interview with the key", "30:23", "people down there but try to like if you", "30:25", "if you're gonna talk to somebody about", "30:26", "this nobody wants to go on record to", "30:28", "talk about it because it's it's really", "30:30", "bad for tourism it's you know and it's", "30:32", "not good for the political your video of", "30:34", "it can we show video well this is yeah I", "30:38", "need to see it race it or it's and", "30:40", "racing extinction second film I did this", "30:46", "oh look at that", "30:48", "there we go oh that's so disgusting four", "30:51", "months ago maybe Wow Wow it is just a", "30:56", "gigantic", "30:57", "pipe pumping green shit into the ocean", "31:02", "was it green by the way quite sure it'll", "31:05", "be the color under the water - you said", "31:06", "there's a green when you saw it as well", "31:07", "right yeah yeah yeah well treated as", "31:12", "it's treated much better that way", "31:14", "well everything everything everything in", "31:16", "the spectrum there's a little bit of", "31:18", "blue or green look at all the food", "31:19", "coloring look at that that's fuck what", "31:21", "is that fish yeah fish sandwich they can", "31:25", "they can eat eat crowd Christ yeah and", "31:29", "build theirs then the fishermen fish on", "31:32", "a - oh Jesus Christ to catch fish that", "31:35", "are eating shit look at that that is", "31:38", "insane", "31:40", "well looking at this pipe and it looks", "31:43", "like like a cloud of poison is is being", "31:48", "jettisoned out of this pipe and into the", "31:51", "ocean then the important part is if you", "31:53", "came up you would see people on the", "31:54", "beach Oh God I mean and we're not", "31:57", "talking about like you know miles out at", "31:59", "sea we're

"that's why we do films is not just to", "32:58", "create the awareness and you know to try", "33:00", "to get something done about it when we", "33:02", "do we know when we did the cove they",

that", "40:39", "well he and his wife found out that", "40:41", "these animals are determined that these", "40:43", "at the end was like humpback whales are", "40:44", "singing you know these strange

actually singing you", "40:57", "know it was actually his wife Katie pain", "40:58", "that figured it out and he wrote up the", "41:00", "paper with it with another guy but like", "41:02", "joyously singing yeah like it like you", "41:05", "know she would have 100 humpback well we", "41:08", "have an issue with playing I can't but", "41:10", "yeah that sex had been sold so it's a", "41:12", "copy written yeah yeah a lot of times we", "41:15", "do that we'll get pulled off of youtube", "41:17", "oh okay", "41:18", "yeah because somebody owns that which is", "41:20", "hilarious right they own

were", "43:49", "going out to feed you know they from", "43:52", "their stock of of a farm raised salmon", "43:56", "they were feeding the animals but that's", "43:58", "you can't that's not sustainable cuz", "43:59", "their event there is so they move around", "44:01", "yeah you can't find them sometimes that", "44:04", "the solution seems to be to get rid of a", "44:05", "lot of the

this wasn't", "44:23", "like the 1930s or something like that", "44:25", "were they you know they had hundreds of", "44:27", "thousands of salmon just coming to this", "44:29", "wall and not

radio", "45:10", "so this is a I did reset the website but", "45:14", "it says that you can explore yourself to", "45:16", "find humpback whale songs and make your", "45:18", "own discoveries",

here", "45:30", "but it's a really cool looking site", "45:31", "anybody wants go check it out", "45:36", "[Music]", "45:40", "[Applause]", "45:44", "what's that heavy-duty pattern over to", "45:47",

know this is a nice room", "48:33", "you know we have plenty of water and", "48:35", "that you know if we needed food and we", "48:37", "had to do backflips for it after a", "48:38", "couple weeks

they'll never tell you that", "49:13", "they're starving an animal to get it to", "49:15", "do tricks but there's young enthusiasts", "49:18", "now know that the dr. imagine that if", "49:21", "you went to you know a university and", "49:25", "like his grades are down what should we", "49:27", "do starve them you imagine if that was", "49:31", "your kid you dad they don't we don't", "49:33",

really", "76:03", "hope people continue down that path you", "76:06", "know especially I mean it's they're", "76:09", "getting better at figuring out how to", "76:11", "charge them and better at battery", "76:13", "capacity and better and they're they're", "76:15", "better to drive I mean we were talking", "76:17", "about Tesla's I mean I have that Model S", "76:20", "I love that thing I mean
