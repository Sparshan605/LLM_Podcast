threatening", "41:04", "woman but how do you keep it fresh like", "41:06", "how do you how do you approach this with", "41:08", "the same sort of intensity and anxiety", "41:11", "that you had in the

get like more pressure and", "41:25", "anxiety off of like rematches I mean I", "41:27", "have all my other past experiences to", "41:30", "draw from so you know like when I", "41:33", "rematch tisha there was a lot of lessons", "41:35", "learned there and I have to kind of", "41:36", "apply those same lessons to going", "41:38", "forward or like other opponents where it", "41:41", "could be", "41:41", "there's many like a list of reasons to", "41:43", "underestimate this person like I have to", "41:45", "remember that anything can happen any", "41:48", "moment and any way it can be dangerous", "41:49", "and then at the end of the day you know", "41:51", "whatever's meant to be is meant to be", "41:52", "you know like", "41:53", "I remember one time like in the middle", "41:56", "of training camp I had like you know I", "41:57", "like my little yogi T's where they like", "41:58", "say like a little you know saying on it", "42:00", "and it was something like if it belongs", "42:02", "to you it'll come to you or something", "42:03", "like that and so it was just like kind", "42:06", "of that's how I feel about the belt it's", "42:07", "like you know don't go chasing the belt", "42:10", "you know just is the belts meant to be", "42:12", "yours it's meant to be yours and do", "42:13", "everything that you can to keep it and", "42:15", "do everything that you can to

got to do", "42:24", "anything though the whole quest has been", "42:26", "to see if like it just the mentality has", "42:29", "been let's see if I'm better than this", "42:31", "next person someone out there is better", "42:33", "than me someone eventually is going", "42:35", "maybe you know me someone out there is", "42:37", "better we just need to find out who it", "42:38", "is and it might be the next person even", "42:40", "if it's someone who we previously fought", "42:42", "it might be her so we have to be as the", "42:45", "the most ready possible because we don't", "42:48", "know who that individual is and also", "42:50", "like focusing on keeping the mentality", "42:53", "of like being curious", "42:55", "rather than having a need to know that", "42:58", "you're the best like just being curious", "42:59", "if you're the best I think that's a", "43:01", "healthy way to approach it rather than", "43:02", "needing to know like I am better than", "43:05", "you it's like I don't know cuz we're all", "43:07", "the same world you know human beings you", "43:10", "know like at the end of the day like if", "43:11", "it's meant to be it's meant to be but", "43:13", "you went into that fight wholly", "43:15", "confident that you were better than her", "43:16", "yeah no I mean I definitely feel like", "43:22", "I'm the better martial artists you know", "43:24", "I'm better than the better fighter too", "43:26", "and it's just there yeah I have a lot of", "43:29", "going for me but I just have to remember", "43:31", "these things that you know like truce", "43:33", "yeah yeah yeah stay focused keep stay", "43:36", "hungry now when it comes to strength and", "43:39", "conditioning how do you how do you how", "43:41", "do you parse that out like how do you", "43:43", "what how much time do you spend doing", "43:45", "that versus how much do you spend on", "43:46", "skill work it's almost like almost all", "43:50", "skill work I mean I shouldn't say all", "43:52", "but it's like the strain the", "43:53", "conditioning isn't something that we", "43:55", "like is is on the first on the priority", "43:57", "list it's kind of just like if we want", "43:59", "to change it up or do something", "44:00", "different like I started doing um sorry", "44:04", "we just got our bikes", "44:06", "it's been fun to do but it's I feel like", "44:08", "strange the conditioning should kind of", "44:09", "just be I don't know I I'm not I don't", "44:13", "really believe in all these like like", "44:14", "strain the conditioned culture i think", "44:15", "whatever you believe in is what you know", "44:17", "works for you and that it works right", "44:19", "but for me that's something that i don't", "44:22", "really i feel like a hamster in a wheel", "44:23", "if i'm going into like some guy telling", "44:26", "me to do these exercises and do this", "44:29", "station and go to this thing for this", "44:31", "amount of time like I just I want to be", "44:32", "free like I want to be you know running", "44:35", "outside I want to do something that", "44:36", "makes me happy and like or for example", "44:38", "like when we went to Indonesia and we

so I want to provide that", "81:25", "for other people and you know fighting", "81:27", "is the best", "81:28", "the quickest way I can do that I think", "81:30", "you know yeah for example I started", "81:36", "getting into like some crypto currencies", "81:38", "and stuff and there's this thing called", "81:40", "evergreen coin that's just like you know", "81:42", "one of the alt coins whoever no no it's", "81:44", "still pretty small whatever but it's", "81:46", "it's a salt like it's a sustainable", "81:48", "cryptocurrency that doesn't doesn't use", "81:52", "as much electricity and it kind of goes", "81:53", "into every kind of philosophy that I", "81:56", "agree upon you know it falls in line", "81:59", "with my beliefs in it there's just a lot", "82:01", "of aspects about it that I really like", "82:03", "and so that's something that like you", "82:05", "get you can it's good for charities so", "82:08", "like if you hold some evergreen coin", "82:10", "like you can get some stock in it from I", "82:14", "sound kind of stupid trying to recite", "82:17", "all this information but yeah like you", "82:19", "just you can generate money with it and", "82:21", "then you can donate it to charity and it", "82:23", "works that way so these are just a bunch", "82:27", "of different things that you would like", "82:28", "to let people know about and help people", "82:31",

"82:39", "these things and I think it just you", "82:41", "know over time it's just kind of kind of", "82:43", "fall into place you know just doing", "82:44", "things like you know the Indonesian",
