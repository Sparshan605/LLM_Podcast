"07:20", "running in a good clip but yo yeah", "07:22", "records yeah I mean we got it good we we", "07:25", "managed to basically predict it so well", "07:27", "that III think that was probably my top", "07:29", "speed which I dare eight point seven", "07:31", "knots eight point seven miles per hour", "07:32", "I was basically cruising along the top", "07:34", "which is how which is like a

me not", "07:44", "necessarily the way yeah and when you", "07:46", "get but but actually you made a good", "07:48", "point in terms of when you get wind over", "07:49", "tide so if you've got ten knots going", "07:52", "this way but you even got a little bit", "07:53", "of wind and waves going this way it can", "07:56", "get choppy okay and and again sort of", "07:59", "looking at west Scotland wind over tide", "08:02", "you can get 40 knots coming straight", "08:04", "down the barrel but you're trying to", "08:06", "swim with the tide yeah so the wind is", "08:10", "coming at you but the tide is going the", "08:12", "opposite and as you can imagine that oh", "08:14", "my god yeah yeah so how do you predict", "08:17", "this this this tide that you have to get", "08:21", "right yeah I mean it's it's incompletely", "08:23", "in theory and this is what I realize", "08:25", "we're not when I sat down and we started", "08:27", "sort of plotting the great what is this", "08:29", "called again what is the the issue", "08:30", "that'll push you back oh just the tidal", "08:33", "yes what is it called", "08:34", "that area oh you say you gotta get right", "08:36", "oh it's at Penn and Firth pending for", "08:39", "the Penland handling for ya yeah and", "08:42", "that's that likes it renowned around", "08:45", "world but but equally if you imagine the", "08:47", "shape of Great Britain there's all sorts", "08:49", "of kind of compression where the water", "08:51", "will just come rush", "08:52", "through and as well as the pennilyn fur", "08:54", "you can get you know six knots around", "08:56", "Wales there's an island called scoler", "08:58", "and if you get that right you are", "09:00", "disappearing up you know and you're", "09:02", "winning you get it wrong again you're", "09:04", "just you're going backwards and four", "09:06", "more for me to do a continuous stage", "09:09", "swim if I'm going backwards I've got to", "09:11", "start where I was going backwards so for", "09:14", "me getting every single tide right and", "09:17", "that's why I saw what the team were", "09:18", "amazing those are the captain Matt was", "09:21", "just incredible that every night the", "09:23", "homework we okay here no did we crash", "09:27", "alright folks if you're listening or", "09:29", "watching we had a little technical", "09:31", "difficulty so this is not streaming live", "09:33", "will be uploaded later we were just", "09:35", "going over how you predicted you had to", "09:39", "and your team had to predict how the", "09:41", "tide was coming because if it went wrong", "09:43", "you'd get pushed backwards like 10 miles", "09:45", "an hour yeah basically and this is the", "09:47", "thing I think with the Great British", "09:49", "swim we were kind of taking swimming as", "09:51", "most people understand it and we were we", "09:54", "were removing it and putting in in an", "09:56", "arena that was so different so and I", "09:58", "think that's why it was it did so well", "10:01", "kind of online as well the community", "10:02", "around it because obviously swimmers", "10:04", "were interested but you know surfers", "10:06", "started to get involved because they", "10:07", "understood the waves sailors fishermen", "10:10", "you know all sorts of people started to", "10:11", "say you know sometimes in Great Britain", "10:14", "it's not safe to take a boat around the", "10:16", "top of Scotland you know for instance", "10:18", "never mind a swimmer so that's that's", "10:21", "why it was amazing that there on the", "10:23", "entire series it became a melting pot", "10:26", "and exchange of ideas because nobody", "10:29", "knew how to get a human body around the", "10:32", "coast of Great Britain it wasn't just", "10:34", "about swimming and that was what was", "10:36", "really cool how do they know like when", "10:39", "the tides are going one way or the other", "10:41", "how do they predict that yeah I mean", "10:43", "tides are so predictable so in theory", "10:44", "they change every six hours so in theory", "10:47", "when we sat down and we looked we know", "10:50", "that if you do six hours on six hours", "10:51", "off for 157 days you'll make it around", "10:55", "the coast of Great Britain you know and", "10:57", "that was the theory so you do this", "10:58", "biphasic sleep and you swim for 12 hours", "11:01", "a day but that's all theory there's", "11:03", "times when as I mentioned", "11:05", "whirlpools or or the tides might not", "11:07", "necessarily if you imagine sort of", "11:09", "that's Great Britain there", "11:10", "the tides don't necessarily go always", "11:12", "like this are they're not that", "11:13", "predictable sometimes if is kind of like", "11:16", "this like that's kind of Wales there the", "11:19", "tides will do this so you might you're", "11:20", "you're doing all these different things", "11:22", "that people are not gonna see what say", "11:25", "listening to it on audio so just try to", "11:26", "just describe it right is they're", "11:28", "basically rather than the tides just", "11:30", "going up and down and working with you", "11:31", "mhmmm sometimes it cross across yes", "11:34", "you're just kind of getting slapped", "11:35", "across the face one sides essentially", "11:37", "and it's not just helping you you're", "11:40", "gonna basically zigzag all the way up", "11:42", "the coast of Great Britain so as", "11:44", "predictable as tides are we found those", "11:46", "so much stuff that when we're out there", "11:48", "we were like whole it wasn't meant to do", "11:49", "that", "11:50", "or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be", "11:52", "there you know but it is and and that", "11:54", "was what was you know pretty yeah pretty", "11:57", "sketchy at some times you know that when", "11:59", "we were out there if a whirlpool just", "12:01", "decides to appear you've got there's not", "12:03", "really enough time to say hang on that", "12:05", "wasn't on the map can we look at that", "12:07", "can we speak to the Met Office and talk", "12:09", "about you know weather report no you", "12:10", "just you I've had to swim through it or", "12:12", "try and get out there as quick as you", "12:14", "could so when you encounter something", "12:16", "like that and you get stuck do you pull", "12:18", "out of the water and try back again", "12:19", "later at the same location you do but", "12:22", "quite often if it was there it's still", "12:24", "gonna be there oh it is what it is yeah", "12:26", "so sometimes there's there's no option", "12:29", "and perhaps the best example of this I", "12:31", "mentioned before bit it's called the", "12:32", "quarry a vacant so sort of west coast of", "12:35", "Scotland and it's a giant whirlpool and", "12:38", "and Matt the captain turned to me and", "12:40", "said look Ross you know I need you to", "12:41", "swim on I need to swim hard you know you", "12:43", "need to swim six hours you just need to", "12:44", "be clear of this whirlpool so as we were", "12:47", "swimming past it I set my watch and some", "12:49", "hard for six hours but about three hours", "12:51", "in I got stung by a jellyfish and I've", "12:55", "been stung by jellyfish a lot before", "12:57", "Eustace you know it's painful but it was", "12:58", "it was bearable but this one particular", "13:01", "jellyfish it just it was searing into my", "13:03", "skin it just it wouldn't stop throbbing", "13:06", "and so I carried on swimming three hours", "13:08", "past and it was just unbearable so I", "13:10", "popped my head up and I looked at Matt", "13:11", "the captain from the boat", "13:13", "I said Matt I'm so sorry I've been stung", "13:15", "you know I'm gonna have to stop I've", "13:17", "been stung by a jellyfish but the pain", "13:18", "just not going away and as I said that", "13:21", "to him he looked down I mean he said", "13:22", "yeah I know because the tentacles still", "13:24", "wrapped around your face so I've", "13:25", "basically been swimming for three hours", "13:28", "with a jellyfish on your face wearing a", "13:30", "jellyfish it wrapped into my goggles so", "13:34", "I took my gun peeled this fat tentacle", "13:38", "threw it away", "13:40", "and they're like that I'll show you in a", "13:42", "minute", "13:42", "there was a picture where my face sort", "13:45", "of changed shape and the goggles", "13:47", "wouldn't fit on my face anymore because", "13:49", "my eye sockets was so swelled and but I", "13:52", "knew that again for all of this", "13:54", "happening the quarry of ekend the giant", "13:56", "whirlpool was still to my left so Matt", "13:57", "was like you still need to swim you", "13:59", "still need to swim so I ended up putting", "14:00", "the goggles over my face and to try and", "14:02", "get them to seal I just punched them", "14:04", "into my face so you just had these", "14:07", "perfect ring and then I managed you're", "14:08", "so swollen yeah so you had to push them", "14:11", "through the swelling basically yeah so", "14:14", "you swim I made another hour we got", "14:17", "clear of the choreo vacance we managed", "14:18", "to clear this giant whirlpool i collapse", "14:20", "onto the boat and and this is the thing", "14:23", "it was at that point that I collapsed", "14:24", "exhausted face now a different shape to", "14:27", "when I started that particular swim and", "14:29", "and the team looked at me and they saw", "14:31", "how bad I was how how be an upper was", "14:34", "but they also knew that that the sea", "14:36", "just doesn't care and in six hours", "14:38", "the tide was going to change and I'm", "14:40", "gonna have to do that all over again", "14:41", "well and it was that kind of brutal", "14:45", "lesson from nature that from a sports", "14:48", "science background I'm interested in you", "14:50", "know rehab rest recovery nutrition", "14:52", "strategies all of this but with swimming", "14:55", "around Great Britain it very quickly", "14:57", "became apparent that the sea just", "14:59", "doesn't care it just doesn't care that", "15:01", "you need to rehab your shoulders it", "15:04", "doesn't care that the ligaments and", "15:05", "tendons in your shoulders are hurting", "15:06", "you might get impingement from swimming", "15:08", "too much you know none of this and", "15:10", "that's why it went from swimming as I", "15:14", "understood it and how a lot of people", "15:16", "understand it to something completely", "15:18", "like surviving basically in the water so", "15:20", "you're swimming schedule would be six", "15:22", "hours on and then you would try to rest", "15:24", "when would you eat during the swims or", "15:28", "between during the swims yeah yeah so", "15:31", "quite often just", "15:32", "you know throwing bananas at me and and", "15:34", "Wow salty bananas basically yeah yeah", "15:37", "just salty but I need to eat them while", "15:40", "you're in the water yeah yeah cuz it cuz", "15:42", "again going back to what we were talking", "15:43", "about with the pendulum first you could", "15:45", "get out and you could get on the boat", "15:46", "but sometimes in a really good tide if", "15:49", "you are just in the water you could be", "15:52", "making four knots you don't have to swim", "15:54", "but if you get in the freezing cold", "15:55", "water of Scotland and you are quite", "15:58", "happy getting hit in the face by", "15:59", "tentacles you can still make four knots", "16:01", "and so that's why so often it became", "16:04", "about something different than swimming", "16:06", "it was just it was just mental fortitude", "16:08", "it was physical fortitude it was", "16:11", "basically I always remember actually", "16:13", "first day of autumn I got up it was two", "16:17", "o'clock so it was a night swim two", "16:18", "o'clock in the morning and I left my", "16:19", "wetsuit out to dry and I had to scrape", "16:23", "just a thin layer of ice off the wetsuit", "16:26", "before I preferred it but if I didn't if", "16:29", "I didn't get in and I didn't spirit that", "16:31", "that way see then that would have been", "16:32", "you know 15 miles potentially that we", "16:34", "would have missed out on and then you", "16:36", "missed those 15 miles that the window of", "16:39", "opportunity to swim around Great Britain", "16:42", "because of the British summer being", "16:43", "notoriously unpredictable and quite", "16:44", "short we wouldn't have made it round", "16:47", "because even towards the end there was", "16:49", "two storms storm a lemon storm Callie", "16:52", "Allie and Callum who kind of stopped us", "16:56", "for those two days where we couldn't", "16:57", "swim because you just couldn't swim in a", "16:59", "storm it wasn't safe so when you were", "17:00", "swimming this was all during the summer", "17:02", "yeah yeah through the autumn and then we", "17:05", "finished November the fourth which was", "17:06", "going into the winter Oh as well and you", "17:08", "started what my June the first so for", "17:11", "since June you've been swimming yeah", "17:14", "basically that's so crazy yeah that's", "17:20", "interesting too you're not built like a", "17:22", "guide expect to be doing this right", "17:24", "you're built like a tank like that's not", "17:27", "normal like you're a big jack guy you", "17:29", "look more like an MMA fighter or a", "17:31", "powerlifter even right you don't look", "17:34", "like an endurance athlete", "17:35", "yeah which and we were just we were", "17:37", "speaking about it because I love the", "17:38", "episode with you in Ct Fletcher I loved", "17:40", "I love that and and you know as a big", "17:43", "fan of you know cab there you are look", "17:44", "at this fucking picture if someone said", "17:50", "that guy's gonna swim around that guy's", "17:52", "gonna swim for half an hour and he's", "17:53", "gonna have fun heart attack you're right", "17:55", "there was a lot yeah I'd probably be", "17:57", "inclined to agree with you but what I", "17:59", "find interesting is when you start", "18:00", "looking at the strength and stamina for", "18:03", "so often people believe the two couldn't", "18:05", "coexist right and Robert Hickson and his", "18:08", "is sort of research around concurrent", "18:10", "training they're basically saying if you", "18:13", "train for strength and stamina you", "18:16", "dilute the potency of the stimuli so", "18:18", "what I mean by that is if you know we", "18:20", "went into the gym just now and you know", "18:22", "me you and Jamie walked into the gym and", "18:24", "we were like okay okay let's let's go", "18:25", "and see what we're doing on in the squat", "18:28", "rack you know that's strength your", "18:29", "body's ability to generate force and we", "18:31", "trained that and then all of a sudden", "18:32", "okay now let's go over to the rowing", "18:33", "machine or let's go for a swim that's", "18:35", "got in swim 10k then all of a sudden our", "18:37", "bodies are gonna go well hang on", "18:39", "which one do you want us to adapt to you", "18:41", "know looking at you know molecular", "18:42", "biology which one do you want us to", "18:45", "adapt to strength or stamina and again", "18:46", "you dilute the potency that stimuli", "18:48", "however there's the theory that if you", "18:50", "separate them within the laws vert I'm", "18:53", "going off on a little bit of a tangent", "18:54", "here but please thank you good looking", "18:57", "at verkhoshansky so one of the greatest", "18:59", "strength and conditioning coaches to", "19:00", "every resist he talks about this idea of", "19:02", "adaptive energy saying that in any given", "19:05", "day you have a certain amount of", "19:06", "adaptive energy and if you are able to", "19:10", "fit both a training session that that", "19:13", "like I said causes your body to adapt to", "19:15", "both strength and stamina you separate", "19:17", "them under those conditions they can", "19:19", "coexist so you separate them by how much", "19:21", "time as much is needed for optimal", "19:23", "recovery so so yeah if we did and this", "19:26", "is that this is what I find fascinating", "19:27", "about MMA because you're essentially", "19:29", "saying to an MMA athlete I need you to", "19:32", "be strong fast quick I need you to be", "19:35", "muscular injured but I also need you to", "19:36", "have plyometric speed strength and their", "19:39", "bodies going you want us to be all of", "19:40", "those things right you know and that's", "19:42", "why quite often it's the athlete with a", "19:44", "higher work capacity who can you know", "19:46", "adapt to those looking at like you know", "19:48", "the Diaz brothers who just do triathlons", "19:50", "for fun you know they have this insane", "19:52", "work capacity", "19:53", "you know say so that's kind of your your", "19:56", "body's ability to perform and positively", "19:57", "tolerate training of a given intensity", "19:59", "or duration right so if you have the", "20:01", "Diaz brothers and you say okay we're", "20:03", "gonna now do weight training in the", "20:04", "morning but by the afternoon I also need", "20:06", "to go swim a 10k their bodies could", "20:08", "tolerate that whereas if you have", "20:10", "another athlete who perhaps you know", "20:12", "doesn't have that work capacity their", "20:14", "body's not going to positively tolerate", "20:16", "it right a person who's used to working", "20:17", "out maybe only an hour a day yeah", "20:19", "absolutely", "20:20", "so so that's essentially how I would", "20:23", "would approach anything like this but", "20:26", "what I found really interesting when", "20:28", "you're talking with with Ct Fletcher was", "20:31", "when you look at strength and stamina", "20:33", "it's it's so specific so you know said", "20:36", "principle specific adaptation to impose", "20:37", "demands you know you get good at", "20:39", "whatever you continually practice and", "20:41", "when you look at endurance in", "20:44", "weight-bearing sports absolutely you", "20:47", "know you can argue that that running for", "20:48", "instance is is just you know power to", "20:50", "weight ratio it's it's a series of", "20:51", "successive jumps and when you start", "20:54", "looking at that there's research that", "20:56", "will show adding and we did this with", "20:58", "the raw Marines back in England when you", "20:59", "just add one kilo of extra weight in a", "21:02", "backpack its effect on pulmonary", "21:04", "ventilation lactic threshold time to", "21:06", "fatigue all of those things just one one", "21:09", "kilogram that's it and so that's why", "21:10", "when you see Tour de France and people", "21:12", "like Chris Froome Bradley Wiggins you", "21:13", "know from Team Sky they are just looking", "21:15", "at the body saying okay your vo2 is what", "21:18", "it is your power to it your power to", "21:19", "weight ratio that's what we need to", "21:21", "improve we need to treat you like a", "21:22", "Formula One car and we need to take away", "21:24", "anything you know so when you look at", "21:25", "Chris Froome you know an unbelievable", "21:27", "athlete and they say well you don't need", "21:28", "biceps you don't need triceps so they", "21:30", "will remove those controlled muscular", "21:32", "atrophy and how do they approach that", "21:36", "intelligently I suppose looking at", "21:39", "anything from you know a calorie deficit", "21:40", "cell not to pick anything up ever kind", "21:42", "yeah there you go you know triceps they", "21:49", "don't run away exactly but I mean that", "21:51", "is that is the perfect example of you", "21:54", "know you know said principle specific", "21:56", "adaptation to impose demands that all he", "21:58", "does is he lives on a bike so as a", "22:01", "result his body is a byproduct of what", "22:03", "he continually practices just got a bike", "22:05", "muscles yeah", "22:06", "yeah and so so looking at that and sorry", "22:10", "going back to strengthen stand with it", "22:12", "when you look at running you could argue", "22:14", "that you know being jacked and being", "22:16", "heavier yes absolutely your power to", "22:19", "weight ratio is gonna impact you so for", "22:21", "instance I like to run but I don't stand", "22:23", "a chance against some of my friends who", "22:25", "are you know fell runners and they weigh", "22:26", "you know thirty kilos less than me how", "22:29", "much richer or exactly", "22:31", "yeah then lean longer just yeah you look", "22:34", "at an unbelievable specimen of a man you", "22:36", "go yes you were built for endurance mhm", "22:38", "but as soon as you go in the water", "22:40", "things might start to change a little", "22:42", "because now it's non-weight-bearing see", "22:44", "them how to weight ratios a little bit", "22:45", "different so then you could art and this", "22:47", "is all theory for the moment but looking", "22:49", "at the body shape to swim around Great", "22:51", "Britain because no one's ever done it", "22:53", "before so you can say okay what does", "22:55", "that body type look like and when", "22:58", "writing down a checklist you say we need", "23:00", "someone who can swim in you know 40", "23:03", "knots of wind wind over tide that we're", "23:04", "talking about so you're not going to", "23:05", "break on top of that as well you can", "23:07", "start to look at all of a sudden we need", "23:10", "someone who's never gonna take a day off", "23:12", "so I wasn't sick throughout those 157", "23:14", "days so there you start looking at", "23:16", "adaptive energy and and work capacity", "23:19", "that we just spoke about and then all of", "23:21", "a sudden you can start getting real into", "23:23", "the detail of looking at okay someone", "23:25", "with a higher muscle mass if they're", "23:27", "able to effectively swim and the", "23:29", "biomechanics are on point so that's not", "23:32", "you know this muscle mass isn't", "23:33", "interfering with their biomechanics", "23:35", "could it be argued that that stored", "23:37", "muscle glycogen can almost turn them", "23:39", "into a human whale you know they're yeah", "23:41", "you're right you put me into the pool", "23:43", "with Michael Phelps and he lapped me you", "23:45", "know he he - look at him swim it's", "23:47", "unbeliev he looks like a dolphin it's", "23:49", "it's beautiful but when it comes to", "23:52", "something like swimming around grouper", "23:54", "and it's just it's just an eating", "23:56", "competition you know with a little bit", "23:57", "of swimming involved and you just need", "23:59", "to make sure you don't break and that", "24:01", "goes back to the tides as well your body", "24:03", "working with ties if you can just keep", "24:05", "getting in the water for 157 days 12", "24:08", "hours a day and not break you'll make it", "24:11", "wearing great brand base so you think", "24:12", "the muscle Mouse aids you in that way I", "24:15", "would argue yes yeah I mean enough this", "24:18", "is purely anecdotal and I'd love to", "24:19", "actual", "24:20", "more research into this but but", "24:21", "certainly with a lot of athletes that I", "24:23", "train with there it's almost like a bell", "24:25", "curve so if you can imagine you know for", "24:27", "those listening like a bell curve like", "24:30", "that how do you describe that just I'm", "24:32", "just so like a horseshoe yeah yeah so", "24:35", "you can argue that here around endurance", "24:37", "so if you've got somebody who's you know", "24:39", "to use rich rods example an amazing", "24:41", "swimmer that over 10k he's gonna be", "24:43", "amazing because his efficiency", "24:44", "everything but then past this point so", "24:47", "when we start looking at the mileage", "24:48", "that we were covering so it sort of", "24:50", "English Channel swimmers 20 miles plus a", "24:52", "day at this point this leaner swimmers", "24:55", "gonna start running out of muscle", "24:56", "glycogen his biomechanics might break", "24:58", "down because he doesn't have the", "25:00", "strength to hold that position", "25:01", "continually all of those things the", "25:03", "waves start crashing in starting to swim", "25:05", "into 40 knots of wind what's gonna", "25:07", "happen are you gonna be would you favor", "25:09", "the the lean a quicker more streamlined", "25:11", "swimmer or would you argue that the guy", "25:13", "with more muscle mass here is gonna", "25:15", "continue to swim not necessarily at the", "25:17", "same pace but would continue not to", "25:19", "break I think it depends on who the man", "25:22", "with the muscle mass is because a lot of", "25:24", "guys with muscle mass they got that", "25:26", "muscle mass for doing very low reps high", "25:29", "weight I mean what what kind of exercise", "25:31", "do you do that gives you a bill like", "25:33", "that see and that's a good point I mean", "25:35", "I loved what you did with them was", "25:36", "dorian yates and i think when you start", "25:39", "looking at the the three mechanisms to", "25:42", "build muscular hypertrophy start looking", "25:44", "at metabolic stress so metabolic stress", "25:48", "being exactly what you just said lots", "25:49", "and lots of reps during it's been a", "25:51", "great example of that that is more", "25:53", "muscular hypertrophy the bodybuilding", "25:55", "centric work yeah that's metabolic", "25:57", "stress lots and lots of reps but then", "25:59", "you can also look at mechanical tension", "26:00", "so that's more your power lifters you", "26:03", "know really really high weight lower", "26:05", "volume just real strength your body's", "26:06", "ability to generate force that is what I", "26:09", "do", "26:09", "and yes it's shown to induce muscular", "26:12", "hypertrophy so to increase muscle mass", "26:14", "but arguably more functional you know", "26:17", "than when you'd be looking at a you know", "26:19", "bodybuilder mr. Olympia something like", "26:21", "that and then you have a muscle damage", "26:23", "which is more eccentric contraction some", "26:25", "more arguably sort of CrossFit so a", "26:28", "bodybuilder to achieve their physique", "26:30", "besides using steroids they have to you", "26:32", "lots of repetitions yeah is that the", "26:35", "idea", "26:35", "yeah that's it so so when you say what", "26:38", "do do I specifically use it's more", "26:40", "mechanical tension so more power lifting", "26:43", "cleans dead lifts is exactly yeah yeah", "26:47", "cuz you're not bit like a bodybuilder", "26:48", "but you you're built like someone was", "26:50", "very strong yeah yeah and I think that's", "26:52", "it where you start and that's not to say", "26:54", "you know when you look it you know to", "26:56", "use you as an example so if we had you", "26:58", "in the sports lab we would say okay what", "27:00", "is your strength deficit so your", "27:01", "strength deficit is is I'd say we had", "27:04", "you on you know the leg press and we", "27:06", "said Joe we want to we want to look at", "27:08", "how much force your legs can generate", "27:10", "with you just using basically your", "27:13", "training strength your training strength", "27:15", "is defined as the strength that you", "27:17", "would use just leg pressing not getting", "27:20", "you all like site of pre workouts", "27:21", "smelling salts none of that will just", "27:23", "say Joe go and leg press and you just", "27:26", "leg press and that's what you can", "27:27", "generate there but then in the sports", "27:29", "I'd back at local university we would", "27:31", "start using basically electric basic", "27:36", "using electrical impulses to to make the", "27:38", "muscles contract beyond what you could", "27:40", "generate yourself so that is what your", "27:42", "body could generate without you trying", "27:44", "to send those impulses bodies you the", "27:46", "actual the actual potential muscle the", "27:48", "the strength of the muscles themselves", "27:50", "how do you determine that like I said", "27:52", "basically electrocuting the muscles and", "27:55", "stimulating involuntarily and through", "27:58", "that do they measure it how so oh so", "28:01", "then that measures your your maximal", "28:03", "output with you not trying to use it", "28:05", "yourself it's involuntary so that is", "28:07", "something that you wouldn't have control", "28:09", "over so this what are they how do they", "28:11", "do that like essentially electrocuted", "28:14", "you but what kind of what is it like", "28:15", "electrodes a slap on your legs and they", "28:17", "force you to extend your legs yeah you", "28:19", "would have seen it yeah exactly that you", "28:21", "lift a weight with that yeah you can do", "28:24", "yeah so that's what they do", "28:25", "yeah yeah I've never heard of such a", "28:27", "thing yeah so you would be sitting in a", "28:29", "leg press and more the extensions and", "28:33", "then make your legs extend yeah yeah Wow", "28:36", "so they would monitor your strength so", "28:38", "the difference between that so all of a", "28:40", "sudden they'll say okay this over here", "28:42", "your training strength is what you could", "28:44", "do Joe when I was just saying okay", "28:46", "lift that right that's what you were", "28:47", "going okay I'll lift it and then over", "28:49", "here when it's involuntary that is what", "28:52", "you could actually do that's the", "28:54", "potential of the muscles what's usually", "28:57", "the higher number", "28:57", "oh absolutely well so it's always", "28:59", "involuntary really always yeah yeah", "29:01", "absolutely how much what and that's the", "29:03", "strength deficit mmm did you see what I", "29:05", "mean so okay so over here this is what", "29:07", "you could generate when you're just", "29:08", "going okay one two three and I'm lifting", "29:10", "it myself okay that done and over here", "29:12", "is what we do when it's involuntary now", "29:14", "if there's a big deficit okay so if", "29:17", "there's a huge deficit between the two", "29:19", "that means you're a pussy it means if", "29:27", "there's a large deficit between the two", "29:29", "it means that you have muscle mass but", "29:31", "you're not fully using it right so you", "29:33", "might see a large deficit between the", "29:35", "two if you had a bodybuilder for", "29:38", "instance because they've got a lot of", "29:39", "muscle mass but they're not using it", "29:41", "does that make sense why aren't they", "29:43", "using it because it's its strength is", "29:45", "functional so they've got all this", "29:47", "muscle mass but they're not recruiting", "29:49", "it they've not actually trained", "29:50", "strengths because strength is near a", "29:51", "muscular so when a bodybuilder does like", "29:54", "high repetitions and what was the type", "29:57", "of load that you were calling that how", "29:58", "they were that was causing hypertrophy", "30:02", "so that's metabolic stress metabolic", "30:04", "stress so just a sheer number of sets", "30:06", "yeah just constant", "30:08", "repetitions over and over and over again", "30:10", "with not that higher weight yes", "30:12", "yeah and that's meant but then", "30:13", "mechanical tension is when it's more", "30:16", "power lifting s right so there's your", "30:18", "difference between the two so the reason", "30:21", "being is meta but so when you start", "30:22", "looking at mechanical tension that might", "30:25", "produce an athlete who has a smaller", "30:27", "strength deficit right so when again", "30:30", "using you as an example if there was a", "30:32", "smaller strength deficit between what", "30:34", "you could voluntarily leg press in a leg", "30:38", "extension hair extension and then", "30:40", "involuntary there's a smaller deficit it", "30:43", "would like it either liken it to okay do", "30:45", "you have this much muscle mass but", "30:47", "you're using a lot of your potential", "30:49", "you're using it already it's almost like", "30:51", "you've got a Formula One car with a huge", "30:54", "engine but you're using it to its full", "30:56", "extent you know and and this is", "30:59", "why I'm going off on a slight tangent", "31:00", "here but this is why when you start", "31:02", "looking at bodybuilding centric work so", "31:04", "this idea of increasing muscular", "31:06", "hypertrophy it can be a good thing when", "31:08", "you understand that strength deficit so", "31:12", "you might have an athlete who you go", "31:14", "okay you have a small strength deficit", "31:16", "it's very small so for the muscle mass", "31:17", "that you have you're using it to its", "31:19", "absolute full potential it's like you", "31:22", "have a very small car but you are just", "31:24", "pushing down the accelerator so hard and", "31:26", "it can't go anymore which is a redline", "31:28", "exactly so the option that we have is to", "31:31", "increase the size of the car the option", "31:32", "we have is it increase the size your", "31:33", "muscle mass is a means-ends it does yeah", "31:36", "it does what kind of training were you", "31:40", "doing to increase your capacity for work", "31:43", "while maintaining the mass yeah and this", "31:46", "this guys it's a bit of a strange story", "31:48", "so this goes back to something I almost", "31:49", "call you know horsepower programming", "31:52", "which i think is it's so often lost now", "31:54", "I think training is very specific when", "31:56", "you go into the gym are you training for", "31:57", "strength speed stamina", "31:58", "whereas horseback programming I almost", "32:01", "borrowed from Soviet Union principle so", "32:04", "you start looking at general physical", "32:06", "preparedness as it was as it was known", "32:07", "and this is this just idea of you take", "32:10", "an athlete certainly younger athlete and", "32:13", "you're trying to increase their work", "32:14", "capacity by nonspecific movements so", "32:17", "you'll get at you're an athlete you're", "32:19", "handed a magic okay you're you're young", "32:22", "kid just growing up and then your", "32:24", "parents hand you to me I'm your coach", "32:26", "and I say okay I don't know if Joe's", "32:28", "gonna be big strong I don't know if he's", "32:30", "gonna be able to run far or fast I don't", "32:32", "know so what we're gonna do is just", "32:34", "create increase your song your muscular", "32:36", "efficiency and work capacity and so by", "32:39", "doing that it's kind of jumps throws", "32:42", "nonspecific these natural movement", "32:44", "patterns and we get you to do lots and",

"59:16", "someone gets him in it I mean he people", "59:18", "tap but he's he's not gonna just have", "59:21", "one arm posted mmm that's just not the", "59:24", "right way to handle but I think that's", "59:25", "because Connor had eaten bombs when I", "59:27", "was about twice so that's all technical", "59:29", "do you yeah so there's that almost as a", "59:31", "I don't know like a continuum than", "59:34", "technical yes you've just you know and", "59:36", "again I should point out you know again", "59:38", "I'm a complete layman when it comes to", "59:39", "mixed martial arts but I find it", "59:40", "fascinating the this adversity training", "59:43", "aspect so you're just saying he was", "59:44", "eating bombs before that", "59:46", "would that would have helped you know", "59:49", "that if he wasn't he didn't mean that", "59:51", "where does it cross over from being tea", "59:52", "would help if he wasn't as tired so like", "59:54", "if that choke was applied during the", "59:57", "first few seconds or minutes of my first", "60:00", "round I think he probably would have had", "60:03", "a good chance to survive okay okay", "60:05", "what's gonna put on Dean Lester he's Eco", "60:07", "choke and he's not it's not being done", "60:09", "well but this is a dif this is not an", "60:11", "easy kill Joe this is this is uh what", "60:15", "this is is I mean it's kind of an easy", "60:18", "kiyul but see where his hand is you got", "60:21", "to really get underneath see his left", "60:22", "hand that left hands got to go not just", "60:25", "there it's got to go under the chin", "60:26", "that's not good enough for a guy like", "60:28", "Dean you got okay now it's pretty", "60:30", "fucking tight now it's tight and he's", "60:32", "got to get further and further and the", "60:34", "further that left arm gets into jeans", "60:36", "neck mmm the more more there's gonna be", "60:39", "a possibility of him choking but Dean", "60:42", "has been fucking choked his whole life", "60:44", "which is but I do have to say that Josh", "60:48", "Barnett made him tap and Josh Barnett is", "60:51", "like one of the few guys that's made", "60:52", "Dean Lister tap and I think the first", "60:54", "time he tapped in a decade and Josh", "60:57", "Barnett got him in a scarf hold and I", "61:01", "thought that was in metamoris and Josh", "61:03", "Barnett who is he's a catch wrestling", "61:06", "specialist yeah go to the very end of it", "61:09", "here Josh Barnett gets ahold of Dean's", "61:12", "he gets it you see in this position", "61:14", "right here he's inside control which is", "61:17", "just impressive enough that Josh is able", "61:19", "to do this with a guy like Dean Lister", "61:20", "but then he gets him and what's uh he", "61:24", "probably has a different name for it but", "61:26", "it's uh we used to call it judo side", "61:28", "control it's quite a bit further down on", "61:31", "this you got to keep going keep going", "61:32", "keep going to keep going all the way to", "61:35", "the end so he gets a hold of his he's", "61:39", "got a head and arm choke here it is here", "61:41", "it is so he's got his head and his arm", "61:44", "trapped together and Josh who's an", "61:46", "enormous leap our 'fl is really neck", "61:49", "cranking him as much as anything and", "61:51", "then Dean was forced to tap but this is", "61:54", "at the end of a long match", "61:55", "and you know it could have been", "61:57", "exhaustion might have played a part in", "61:59", "it it most certainly was Josh's skill", "62:02", "and his ability to apply that technique", "62:04", "but the point is is a guy like Dean", "62:07", "Lister you're not gonna tap that guy", "62:09", "easy but this is an again again it with", "62:12", "sort of holding my hands up saying I'm", "62:14", "so sort of naive a huge fan of anime but", "62:17", "not necessarily any of the technical", "62:18", "aspects but what I love is when you look", "62:20", "at someone like you know Nick Diaz or", "62:22", "Michael Bisping mm-hmm you know people", "62:24", "don't understand his conditioning and he", "62:26", "will just wear people down massive", "62:28", "mental toughness - with what Bisping has", "62:30", "is just insane mental toughness", "62:32", "you know Bisping basically has one eye", "62:34", "well if you look at his eyes his one of", "62:38", "his eye actually and I hope he can get", "62:40", "surgery on it now because he is retired", "62:42", "he has oil like embedded in his eye to", "62:48", "protect his

he retired is he started", "63:00", "to see some irregularities in his vision", "63:02", "in his left eye so his good eye was", "63:04", "fucking up too but I mean Michael", "63:07", "Bisping is a fucking animal I mean he is", "63:09", "he's about as tough as it gets and he's", "63:12", "not like a spectacularly physically", "63:15", "talented guy like a John Jones or Yoel", "63:17", "Romero is just this unbelievable", "63:19", "specimen Michael's you know a really", "63:22", "good athlete unquestionably but it's", "63:24", "just tough", "63:25", "just fucking tough so to answer your", "63:27", "question there's there's us and you", "63:29", "could speak to this because what you're", "63:32", "talking about the ability to overcome", "63:34", "adversity like some people when you were", "63:37", "talking about that fatigue is an", "63:41", "emotionally driven thing that there's", "63:43", "this feeling that you get and you can", "63:45", "give in to that feeling where you're", "63:47", "like oh my god I fucking can't do this", "63:49", "anymore", "63:49", "and some people are more susceptible to", "63:51", "that than others and they give in to it", "63:54", "quickly I mean for a person here's", "63:56", "here's where you can experience this", "63:57", "like what whether or not your mindset", "64:01", "can affect your endurance get on a", "64:05", "treadmill or a

and", "74:10", "then I would do the Versa climber and", "74:12", "then I added in that air runner", "74:15", "treadmill which is what is it called Air", "74:18", "Assault", "74:19", "I think Air Assault treadmill yeah which", "74:21", "is a treadmill that you power yourself", "74:22", "you you your feet pushing on it and", "74:26", "pulling it is what makes it go fast it's", "74:28", "not like a treadmill that you keep up", "74:30", "with it's actually more difficult than", "74:31", "actual running 13% more difficult than", "74:34", "actual running on the street so I was", "74:38",

and", "75:04", "then I had all this energy and madness", "75:07", "like everything was changing like my", "75:09", "capacity for work changed everything", "75:12", "adapted", "75:13", "I got a little dehydrated one time and I", "75:15", "had pissed it looked like iced tea which", "75:16", "is not good so I started I'm panicking", "75:19", "and wondering about things like rhabdo", "75:22", "Milos's and kidney failure but I didn't", "75:25", "have anything wrong with that was just a", "75:26", "little bit of hydration but what's", "75:28", "interesting to go back what we were", "75:29", "talking about there you just perfectly", "75:30", "described that idea of giving a clear", "75:33", "cellular signal to the body so polarized", "75:35", "training yeah it was you know that 80/20", "75:37",

at strongman training you know", "76:27", "the some of the strongest guys and one", "76:30", "of these strongest guys in the world all", "76:31", "understood the benefits of cardio", "76:34",

again", "77:26", "- whether you know they knew it or not", "77:29", "they were almost creating an athlete", "77:31", "like they were creating athletes back in", "77:32", "the sort of Soviet Union era

that man", "78:36", "my man's weren't chucks he sets that the", "78:39", "cliff on YouTube where he sets the the", "78:41", "rowing record the indoor rowing record", "78:43", "and it was just because he didn't know", "78:46", "sir you know so what things basically", "78:49", "down there he's rowing and it sounds", "78:51", "like someone started an engine and it's", "78:53", "better like this he go and we hear this", "78:57", "so this they've just looked rows of the", "78:59", "mouthpiece look the whole thing they", "79:01", "have to hold it down in the end because", "79:03", "it's coming out of the floor", "79:05", "Christ these guys are standing on it it", "79:07", "sounds like a like just an that's a jet", "79:10", "engine right", "79:11", "all that power from a leg exactly well", "79:14", "no and his bear I mean that technique as", "79:16", "well I mean Brian doesn't mind me saying", "79:18", "it's not necessarily you know Olympic", "79:21", "rowing technique but he doesn't need it", "79:23", "because he's just got silly power", "79:25", "playing a hundred so the hundred well", "79:28", "there's a catch phase and it's more", "79:30", "you're almost treating it more like a",

looks", "79:48", "like a very tall man - he's huge", "79:50", "how big is this guy 686 yeah I mean so", "79:54", "that helps - right because the long", "79:55", "stroke absolutely it's just pure power", "79:58", "but anyway so they found that they", "79:59", "during this session I believe what", "80:01", "happened is they said well you know a", "80:03", "rower shouldn't make that sort of noise", "80:05", "he's basically two people put together", "80:07", "he's six foot what 401 654 425 - big", "80:14", "guys strapped together in one body he's", "80:17", "almost 200 pounds above the

basketball", "80:35", "background and and a still", "80:36", "look he didn't know that he was gonna", "80:37", "set the world record for Rowand so the", "80:39", "rowing record they go his one was twelve", "80:40", "point eight I believe it was 1308 broke", "80:44", "the rowing record but because he had", "80:46", "that neural neuromuscular background", "80:48", "that they said hey Bryan you're big and", "80:50", "powerful just this is a rowing machine", "80:52", "right he went oh okay there you go", "80:54", "congratulations there's a world record", "80:56", "Wow so it's that base that I think's", "80:58", "often I've heard you speak about certain", "81:00", "Eddie as well talking about breakdancers", "81:02", "making great yes you know be today and", "81:04", "again whether you know they had that", "81:07", "neuromuscular foundation they understood", "81:09", "proprioception where then oligomers", "81:11", "tends everything should work right", "81:13", "whereas if you had someone with a", "81:14", "similar work capacity or someone of the", "81:16", "same age everything was the same but", "81:18", "they didn't have that neuromuscular", "81:19", "efficiency you'd say okay", "81:21", "and again this is me so naively again on", "81:24", "don't claim to know anything about BJJ", "81:25", "but you go okay this is an armbar this", "81:26", "is and they kind of go okay let me try", "81:29", "and figure this out and you can see", "81:30", "there's like a Rubik's Cube they're", "81:31", "trying to piece it together but you get", "81:33", "someone again like Brian and you go okay", "81:36", "this is BJJ or something quite complex", "81:39", "that requires you and he I'm not saying", "81:41", "he wouldn't even fight it's too heavy", "81:47", "similar movement to deadlifts which is", "81:50", "very common it is he's used to that", "81:52", "movement it is yeah it is but I suppose", "81:55", "where you saw him you know that wasn't", "81:56", "actually there was no extension of the", "81:58", "back right he was bent over just ripping", "82:00", "there's another one again even to use", "82:02", "Brian is an example where he does I", "82:04", "believe I can't endure the name with a", "82:06", "ward now but he went up and Thor as well", "82:09", "another strong man did a I think it was", "82:12", "a clean and jerk there was a ward that", "82:15", "was predominantly clean and jerk and", "82:16", "there was this amazing crossfitter", "82:18", "technique was beautiful disappearing", "82:20", "under the bar over his head it was", "82:22", "amazing to watch and I think it was Thor", "82:24", "or Brian sure went in and just instead", "82:26", "of a clean injure and Joe honestly he", "82:28", "just basically upright rows the whole", "82:30", "thing and complete and they were like", "82:32", "well that's not a clean and jerk but you", "82:35", "just set a record so there's that", "82:38", "element to use an example as well with", "82:40", "with oh here we go here we go oh my god", "82:46", "okay there's another strong but there is", "82:48", "there's another one of those where you", "82:50", "see the CrossFit with this amazing", "82:53", "beautiful technique he's he's so far", "82:56", "from his chest it's crazy that he's", "82:58", "doing it like that and what is that 225", "83:01", "pounds in the fucking shit that is so", "83:07", "crazy - he could do that he's doing so", "83:10", "many reps right right that is insane but", "83:14", "he doesn't have a pause no back a so", "83:16", "that's meant to be a clean and jerk I", "83:18", "know so that's what I mean about that", "83:19", "neuromuscular efficiency that he's gone", "83:21", "okay here's a new sport come get", "83:24", "involved and he's got a key I see the", "83:25", "rules of your sport but I'm gonna do it", "83:27", "my way and didn't count well yeah I", "83:30", "suppose I mean if that would is just put", "83:32", "the weight above your head like that guy", "83:34", "did it normal that time right", "83:36", "yeah yeah but there's like this if you", "83:40", "put in you know Thor versus CrossFit", "83:44", "that then it will probably come up and", "83:45", "you get to see an amazing crisp", "83:47", "technique mmm and then equally Thor is", "83:50", "basically doing what what Brian was", "83:52", "doing just there I'll say here you go so", "83:54", "this is they keep putting on weight", "83:56", "until one of them I believe the", "83:58", "competition ears you keep not yeah", "83:59", "they're your CrossFit versus amounting", "84:00", "it's amazing technique disappears under", "84:02", "the bar you know incredible and then I", "84:04", "think you know Thor will eventually come", "84:06", "in and give it a go and basically just",

think one of the things that I", "90:09", "learned from teaching martial arts is", "90:11", "that women they learn technique better", "90:14", "many times than men do", "90:16", "because one they listen and two they", "90:20", "don't try to muscle things so women have", "90:23", "less of a problem with learning", "90:25", "something from a person and this is also", "90:27", "true about archery

"91:05", "they develop this pattern of proper", "91:07", "technique I noticed this with Taekwondo", "91:09", "and I think my friend John said he", "91:11", "noticed this with archery I think this", "91:14", "this this benefits them in sports", "91:16", "because like if you learn jujitsu really", "91:19", "the best people to learn from our", "91:21", "smaller men or women because they the", "91:24", "smaller people they don't have the", "91:26", "physical strength to pull it off on a", "91:28", "big guy hmm so what they have to rely on", "91:30", "is correct technique hmm but if you", "91:33", "learn jujitsu from a big guy man big guy", "91:36", "jujitsu is weird because they could just", "91:38", "grab your wrist and you can't get go you", "91:40", "can't let go and they can get away with", "91:42", "things like okay you go wrist control", "91:43", "and throw the legs up wrist control okay", "91:46", "wrist control on who where I try wrist", "91:49", "control on that big

gonna have to go against", "91:58", "his strength you're gonna have to figure", "91:59", "out a way to move around it you don't", "92:01", "have to go you're not gonna go through", "92:02", "it right that big guy if he was teaching", "92:04", "jujitsu let's just grab the neck and", "92:06", "then you squeeze it he's got the kind of", "92:10", "horsepower that a man like you know a", "92:13", "normal man can't imagine yeah do you", "92:16", "think that's changing a kenta to bring", "92:17", "it back to the US see I suppose because", "92:19", "now I mean with what Cormier is doing", "92:20", "and you know John Jones coming back you", "92:22", "know the lightweights are all moving up", "92:24", "to heavyweight do you think you know", "92:26", "gone are the days of the huge", "92:28", "dude who was just a physical phenom and", "92:31", "now the smaller technical dudes is that", "92:33", "there's a there's a thought with the 265", "92:36", "pound weight class and the consensus", "92:38", "thought seems to be that somewhere", "92:41", "around 240 pounds is the magic number", "92:44", "that's what they think they think that", "92:47", "240 pounds is the amount of weight that", "92:50", "you have where you're strong enough that", "92:52", "you can knock out any man but you have", "92:55", "more endurance than a man that may be", "92:57", "ways to 65 or heavier and cuts down to", "93:00", "265 okay now this has not been", "93:02", "substantiated the problem is there there", "93:05", "hasn't been a really super powerful", "93:09", "World Championship athlete that weigh", "93:11", "265 pounds there's been Brock Lesnar", "93:14", "but yeah Brock Lesnar's enhanced right", "93:19", "you're dealing with a guy who tested", "93:21", "positive for steroids he probably has", "93:24", "had things and then this is a new world", "93:26", "he's also 40 years old now so it's", "93:28", "impossible to tell what he would have", "93:30", "been like it threw knee if he was clean", "93:32", "and then you have guys like Francis and", "93:34", "Ghana who's 265 pounds massive knockout", "93:37", "artist natural 265 pounds but doesn't", "93:41", "have the wrestling base got exposed in", "93:43", "his fight with ste paimio CH if you", "93:44", "can't knock you out he's kind of doomed", "93:46", "and he tired out after the first round", "93:48", "okay so it's hard to say because there's", "93:50", "never been a 265 pound version of Cain", "93:53", "Velasquez ok Cain Velasquez my humble", "93:56", "opinion when I look at all of the", "93:59", "different heavyweights that I've", "94:00", "personally seen fight Cain stands out as", "94:02", "the best the reason why Cain stands out", "94:04", "as the best is because he has superhuman", "94:06", "endurance yeah and his ability to put a", "94:09", "pace on guys you would see these guys", "94:11", "just wilt under the pressure of and I", "94:15", "think with Cain you this is where it", "94:18", "gets really interesting what did him in", "94:20", "is probably what also brought him to the", "94:22", "top is his mental toughness because his", "94:25", "body started breaking down he started", "94:27", "having all these back injuries you", "94:29", "needed back surgery multiple back", "94:30", "surgeries shoulder surgery knee surgery", "94:32", "everything was getting fucked up and I", "94:34", "think it was getting fucked up because", "94:36", "he was working through pain and because", "94:38", "he has the ability to tolerate pain that", "94:40", "most people don't have", "94:41", "right he's just a fucking animal but", "94:44", "that's also probably what led to him", "94:48", "having this insane endurance mmm is the", "94:50", "same kind of mental toughness I'm sure", "94:52", "there's some genetic advantages as well", "94:53", "because they would talk about how he", "94:55", "would take months off and come back in", "94:57", "still fuck everybody up because he's", "94:59", "just that good but that also could be", "95:01", "attributed to the the cardio base that", "95:04", "he had from competing for many many many", "95:06", "many years at a high level and and being", "95:09", "known for that insane endurance mmm", "95:11", "perceptions of fatigue going back he", "95:13", "said if you could quantify that you'd", "95:14", "put cane up there with one of those", "95:15", "people yes he has that in abundance yes", "95:18", "and anyone else in the heavy weights", "95:21", "then would you say well Cormier for sure", "95:23", "has tremendous fatigue ability to", "95:26", "tolerate fatigue and tremendous", "95:28", "endurance and he breaks people you know", "95:30", "they call him the king of the grind and", "95:31", "but on top of that they would they both", "95:34", "have is tremendous wrestling technique", "95:36", "that the wrestling technique as well as", "95:38", "the endurance everything plays a factor", "95:40", "Jon Jones fits into that camp as well", "95:42", "Jon Jones has tremendous wrestling", "95:45", "technique as well striking technique", "95:46", "massive physical skills but also mental", "95:50", "toughness his mental toughness is", "95:52", "unchallengeable like you you absolutely", "95:55", "have to give it up to him he's had his", "95:56", "arm fucked up by Vitor Belfort", "95:59", "completely hyper-extended refused to tap", "96:01", "and then one up tapping Vitor with a", "96:03", "with a Americana I believe it was the", "96:05", "next round", "96:06", "and toe against Chael Sonnen I was", "96:08", "Thomas fuck even notice in Todd was", "96:11", "interviewing them I was interviewing him", "96:13", "he looked down oh shit look at my tone", "96:15", "he started going to shock was as bad as", "96:17", "turned upside down", "96:19", "it was completely turned upside down I", "96:21", "mean imagine that I mean if he wound up", "96:23", "going into the next round if he didn't", "96:25", "stop Chael Sonnen and his toe was that", "96:27", "fucked up and he wound up losing to", "96:29", "Chael Sonnen because his toe was bad mmm", "96:32", "that's insane he also went through that", "96:35", "fight with Alexander Gustafsson", "96:36", "where he wasn't really training very", "96:38", "hard for that fight and Gustafson won", "96:41", "the first couple rounds and then John", "96:43", "Jones won the last two to take it away", "96:45", "and and I watch that back obviously with", "96:47", "all the promotion at the moment and I", "96:48", "think was wink with Jana Jackson when he", "96:50", "starts shouting the heart heart you know", "96:52", "shouts and that was that that was the", "96:53", "decide I mean that's you know", "96:54", "that was the deciding factor that you", "96:56", "come out and you produce that yeah also", "96:59", "in John Jones's favor I believe he has", "97:02", "to fucking super-athlete brothers yeah", "97:05", "and they used to apparently beat the", "97:06", "shit out of each other all the time and", "97:08", "his brothers are bigger than him right I", "97:09", "think that is a factor because I think", "97:11", "that there's mental toughness that comes", "97:13", "from being around that kind of combat in", "97:16", "the household all the time yeah yeah I", "97:19", "think it's a bunch of different faiths", "97:20", "but it's it's hot you I don't know I", "97:23", "think you can teach that I don't believe", "97:27", "that mental toughness is something you", "97:29", "either have or you don't have I don't", "97:31", "believe that I think you can teach it", "97:33", "but you gotta want it and you gotta be", "97:36", "willing to learn you got to be able to", "97:37", "bring yourself to a state of mind where", "97:40", "you're unbreakable I think it's possible", "97:43", "I really do and some people just have", "97:46", "that that is that mean and I think", "97:48", "they've developed it over a long period", "97:50", "of time and once they finally got to", "97:52", "whether it's wrestling or jujitsu or MMA", "97:55", "they already had it and then they", "97:57", "accentuated it and and added on to it", "98:00", "and then it got stronger and then they", "98:01", "become known for it like that guy is", "98:02", "just an animal he's just a mentally", "98:04", "strong but I think that mental strength", "98:06", "comes from many life experiences and", "98:08", "probably probably the guidance of their", "98:11", "parents or some other role model in", "98:14", "their life that also showed them", "98:15", "incredible endurance and incredible", "98:18", "discipline and this this mental", "98:21", "fortitude I think you can teach it", "98:23", "though yeah I think you know I don't I", "98:26", "don't believe that it's something that's", "98:28", "just either have or you don't have I", "98:30", "think you either have it or you don't", "98:32", "have it but you can get it that's what I", "98:34", "think and you know I'm a huge fan of Dan", "98:36", "Hardy we've been chatting since the the", "98:38", "swim and I always go back to that armbar", "98:40", "with the George st.

"arguably of all time I mean the argument", "99:32", "is it's between him Matt Hughes and I", "99:35", "believe now tyron woodley is in that", "99:37", "camp as well was like that the greatest", "99:39", "welterweights ever but you what you get", "99:42", "out of Dan Hardy is a guy who's thought", "99:43", "things through I mean he it really comes", "99:45", "through in his commentary he's a very", "99:47", "very intelligent guy would you say he's", "99:49", "the same sort of cut from the same cloth", "99:50", "as call me a them because I know Brendan", "99:52", "spoke about this recently saying he's", "99:54", "the most intelligent fighter on the UFC", "99:56", "roster at the moment Cormier yeah but", "99:58", "his approach yeah in his approach and", "100:01", "how he will break people but again you", "100:03", "know when you watch you in the UFC and", "100:04", "betting and stuff you like you can't", "100:06", "help but love Cormier such a nice guy", "100:08", "but and this goes back to what I suppose", "100:11", "you said about the swim you know when it", "100:13", "was like oh you're very smart and stuff", "100:14", "but I see that in Colma he's the nicest", "100:16",

actually", "116:44", "and that that would be a really sort of", "116:46", "good point to make there that I always", "116:48", "think when people say I'm too old", "116:50", "now to train and stuff I'm not", "116:51", "absolutely not when yes granted when", "116:53", "you're younger elasticity in your", "116:55", "ligaments yeah higher testosterone", "116:57", "muscle mass ability to you know

know I think I can do", "118:41", "forty four peaks in the Lake District in", "118:43", "under 24 hours and they were no no no", "118:45", "that's not possible it's not possible he", "118:46", "said yeah so that was like a bet in a", "118:48", "pub you know and they're like yeah and", "118:49", "sure enough that's what he did and so", "118:51", "there's this race now called the bagram", "118:53",

this and what I love", "119:40", "about this is yeah yeah there you go", "119:43", "Kilian Jornet so the guy behind in the", "119:45", "blue set the record says there I needed", "119:48", "to suffer says Kilian Jornet after", "119:51", "breaking the record that has stood for", "119:52", "36 years 36 years Wow I needed to suffer", "119:55", "but but these guys and it goes back to", "119:58", "you know too often it's sports science", "120:01", "sports nutrition let's look at look at", "120:02", "your gait analysis running biomechanics", "120:04", "what Footwear are you using minimal", "120:06",

"120:19", "terrain like you could on this descent", "120:20", "on this picture for instance you could", "120:22", "be running down there struggling down", "120:23", "the rocks and you might not know that", "120:24", "just you know 50 meters to your right", "120:26", "there's a perfect sheep trail and that's", "120:29", "kind of the concept of fell running so", "120:32", "it's just a matter of

there is pacing", "120:40", "him basically because it's very easy to", "120:42", "get lost on there's no specific path", "120:45", "that you have to take you have to get", "120:47", "over it there's certain points that you", "120:49", "have to get you but then in terms of the", "120:50", "terrain and perhaps it no not really so", "120:52", "it's just point to point to point to", "120:54", "point how do they mark those points do", "120:56", "they have our cones well I mean this", "120:57", "year will be long established that to do", "120:59", "the Bob Graham you need to do that point", "121:01", "that point and then you come back to MU", "121:03", "Hall you know within hopefully 24 hours", "121:06", "and if you do it then you have you but", "121:08", "they're back please have your Bob Graham", "121:09", "these guys look like a guy that would do", "121:13", "that whereas you don't right this is my", "121:15", "point about you and during", "121:17", "it's like how your physique you don't", "121:20", "see a guy with your physique doing this", "121:22", "kind of stuff yeah you think that you", "121:24", "could do this kind of stuff running I", "121:26", "mean no I and I always say I'm not", "121:28", "self-deprecating and how much do you", "121:30", "weigh about 100 kilos which is a lot", "121:34", "considering 20 yes that's about 120", "121:36", "pounds yeah yeah so aren't yet the Bob", "121:39", "Graham is something complete different", "121:40", "and that goes back to what we were", "121:41", "talking about about power-to-weight", "121:42", "ratio right in a weight bearing sports", "121:44", "it was something like running cuz you're", "121:46", "so heavy", "121:47", "yeah oh you have a lot of power yeah do", "121:49", "you think it would be possible if you", "121:51", "put if you added more power to obviously", "121:54", "not now because you're getting off for", "121:55", "five months on a boat but if you built", "121:58", "your legs and your feet back up do you", "122:00", "think you could do this yeah I do you", "122:02", "think I'm just possibly on surf but", "122:04", "nowhere near I mean Kilian Jornet what", "122:06", "he's he's amazing I mean with Killian he", "122:08", "I believe don't come out he's almost", "122:10", "sort of semi-nomadic he grew up in the", "122:13", "hills semi-nomadic ya know so for him he", "122:16", "would run a marathon to go and get his", "122:18", "you know carton of milk in the morning", "122:20", "oh Jesus you know so when you are lining", "122:22", "up on a start line I mean if you're", "122:24", "racing it can you look over and you've", "122:26", "got a guy like that", "122:27", "fuck yeah you can't beat that guy but", "122:32", "he's but he is built for that this is my", "122:36", "bike so you but you don't think that", "122:38", "guy's built for swimming like if that", "122:40", "guy had to do what you did swimming wise", "122:42", "he would be at a disadvantage", "122:44", "over a certain difference going back to", "122:46", "the bell rang that somebody like that", "122:47", "and in my experience when I have raced", "122:50", "or swum with you know guys who are doing", "122:52", "you know 10 kilometer they they will be", "122:54", "quicker than me over 10 kilometers but", "122:56", "then it gets to a point when we're like", "122:58", "you thirty kilometers in where their", "123:01", "biomechanics just because of muscle", "123:03", "injures that starts to break down maybe", "123:05", "as well and this is so often overlooked", "123:07", "actually but you've got to train your", "123:09", "digestive system so again this is mainly", "123:12", "anecdotal but you know in strength based", "123:15", "sports you know a lot of guys won't", "123:17", "think anything about putting away 15,000", "123:20", "calories a day which is what I was doing", "123:22", "so I'm doing that while you're swimming", "123:24", "yeah 15,000 yeah 15,000 calories", "123:27", "what was it in a lot of it you were", "123:29", "sitting down once", "123:30", "got inside the boat yeah what were you", "123:32", "eating just it was so intuitive so it", "123:35", "was it was kind of strange because the", "123:36", "diet was calorie dense so you have to", "123:38", "make up for your calorie requirements", "123:39", "the day also looking at nutrient dense", "123:41", "cuz you got a care for your immune", "123:42", "system but equally palatability so when", "123:44", "my tongue was falling upon you know I", "123:46", "needed to look at that and even", "123:47", "seasickness who's not really spoke about", "123:49", "as well which is kind of like you need", "123:51", "something that hits those four points", "123:52", "and that's 15,000 calories a day so for", "123:55", "me that was quite often just like", "123:57", "porridge oats you know mixed with honey", "123:59", "mixed with almond butter and then even", "124:01", "like an oh here we go", "124:02", "yeah so this is you eating what's that", "124:05", "yeah oh there might be one there", "124:08", "somewhere yeah what is that in there Bo", "124:10", "beans mostly yeah and this is what just", "124:13", "got to the point where it was like what", "124:15", "can you just like what he's gonna so I", "124:17", "was just eating out the pan just trying", "124:19", "to shove it in your face yeah so I what", "124:21", "what would you eat like what would the", "124:23", "fool this this is probably quite a good", "124:24", "one yeah like so yeah there you go like", "124:26", "in terms of so essentially as a", "124:29", "nutritional sort of in theory the", "124:31", "framework you get what was that mask oh", "124:33", "so that was to stop the jellyfish", "124:35", "oh no but it doesn't matter like even", "124:40", "the mask is the giant jellyfish of", "124:42", "Scotland there'll be a pitch on there", "124:43", "somewhere they're kind of like six feet", "124:45", "long so when you're swimming at night", "124:47", "and you can't see them the tentacles", "124:50", "will they'll just kinda they'll get you", "124:52", "and so I got like they can go in your", "124:54", "mouth and you're in I got one in my ear", "124:56", "I got like wet willy by a jellyfish it", "124:58", "just kind of got me there so it's like", "125:00", "that that yeah they're trying to find", "125:03", "and adapt the same way with the mass but", "125:04", "nutritionally as well but also looking", "125:07", "it as a framework you're having your", "125:10", "protein which is pretty stable you know", "125:11", "1.7 grams per kg of body weight per day", "125:13", "you know that kind of stays the same so", "125:16", "then for the rest of the 15,000 calories", "125:17", "you basically need to make it up with", "125:19", "your two energy-yielding makarand you", "125:21", "change so carbs and fats and so for me", "125:24", "it was very calm dependent because when", "125:26", "you are swimming for a giant whirlpool", "125:28", "you can't say can I have some fats which", "125:30", "the body has to go a certain process is", "125:32", "gonna take longer no you just need", "125:33", "fast-acting carbohydrates but then", "125:35", "equally looking at MCTS so a medium", "125:39", "chain triglycerides as well which are a", "125:41", "fat so they have the calorie density of", "125:44", "a", "125:44", "but they're treated more like a", "125:46", "carbohydrate rather than long chain", "125:48", "triglycerides so there was a certain", "125:51", "amount of site so a lot of people would", "125:52", "say you know a fifteen thousand calories", "125:54", "that mean pizza or in everything it's", "125:55", "like well you know yes to an extent but", "125:59", "then place too much emphasis on that and", "126:01", "you're not caring for your immune system", "126:03", "as well right to get 15,000 calories I", "126:05", "think yeah I always point out that it's", "126:07", "using things like MCTS which will find", "126:09", "in coconut oil and certainly again not", "126:12", "to get too much on the science but", "126:13", "capric and caprylic acid which are", "126:14", "converted to ATP adenosine triphosphate", "126:17", "it's a molecular energy the muscles when", "126:19", "you understand how to use em see T's", "126:22", "like that it can be quite easy to make", "126:24", "up 15,000 calories you know you try and", "126:27", "make up 15,000 calories of vegetables", "126:30", "right yeah exactly especially you might", "126:33", "have like protein and then fruit and it", "126:35", "requires a different digestive enzyme", "126:37", "and then you're gonna tell me to go and", "126:38", "swim for a giant whirlpool and roll on", "126:40", "my stomach for 12 hours a day it's just", "126:42", "like with seasickness it's not gonna", "126:44", "happen yeah you just you must need a lot", "126:46", "of a really dense foods yeah and and", "126:49", "that's the thing that it goes back to", "126:50", "again this this bell curve that I've", "126:52", "spoke about but you know what quite", "126:54", "often a lot of endurance athletes that I", "126:56", "train with who are amazing they're", "126:58", "unbelievable they're sub-3 our marathons", "127:00", "they're incredible you know they're", "127:01", "they're the guys that will go and run", "127:02", "the Bob Graham but quite often they say", "127:05", "but Ross can just eat and it's just like", "127:08", "yeah that's often overlooked you know", "127:11", "that my body you know I didn't have a", "127:13", "sick day for out the whole swim that's", "127:15", "really was that attribute and I pop I", "127:17", "started at 92 kilos and you know when", "127:20", "you when you look at the pictures from", "127:22", "the start to the finish I just look like", "127:24", "just like hereok yeah but just also just", "127:28", "bulk because you are asking your body to", "127:32", "swim around Great Britain so it's not", "127:34", "just the fact that you are you don't", "127:36", "want to be in a calorie deficit can you", "127:38", "imagine how much microtrauma the body's", "127:40", "gonna go through so you're essentially", "127:42", "just trying to nurse the body saying", "127:44", "look I know this is horrible I know it's", "127:46", "cold I know I'm asking you to swim for", "127:49", "12 hours a day I know there's gonna be", "127:50", "jellyfish toxins I mean not something", "127:52", "off stung like and in 20 times in one", "127:55", "night in a single tide you know so it", "127:57", "got to the point where", "127:57", "I talked about my face or changing shape", "128:01", "but equally the toxins in your body your", "128:02", "heart would start beating faster and you", "128:04", "know so there was just this idea that", "128:06", "just eat just to look after the body so", "128:10", "when it comes to nutrition and were you", "128:12", "taking any supplements were you taking", "128:14", "vitamins yeah lots and and that goes to", "128:18", "like I said that calorie density mm-hmm", "128:20", "but also to make sure that you're making", "128:22", "the immune system yeah you're taking", "128:25", "everything from super green shakes you", "128:27", "know to multivitamins to protein shakes", "128:30", "just to make sure that you were", "128:33", "supplementing that calorie density I", "128:35", "think so often overlooked the higher", "128:37", "turnover of like phytochemicals enzymes", "128:40", "micronutrients what about fish oil", "128:42", "anything yeah mega threes yeah and", "128:45", "that's what just anything that you were", "128:48", "thinking well this is even two glutamine", "128:50", "to a higher turnover of amino acids so", "128:53", "after a for instance after training as", "128:55", "well you can have all the protein in the", "128:58", "world but if it has a low biological", "129:00", "value so I can I'm gonna try and keep", "129:03", "score but if you look at you know", "129:04", "immediately after a workout you know", "129:06", "your body's basically saying look when", "129:08", "you protein to repair and regrowth", "129:09", "protein synthesis and your muscles are", "129:10", "saying please but if you don't have a", "129:13", "high concentration of leucine", "129:14", "specifically so branched chain amino", "129:15", "acids leucine within that is what will", "129:18", "trigger to your motor receptors to", "129:19", "basically repair and regrow so quite", "129:22", "often you can have all the protein in", "129:23", "the world but if it's of a low", "129:25", "biological value if it's not very good", "129:28", "quality protein your body's not going to", "129:30", "assimilate it right so it's not about", "129:31", "the protein that you eat it's about the", "129:33", "protein you assimilate right so you", "129:35", "would take branched chain amino acids", "129:37", "post-workout yeah yeah and specifically", "129:39", "I said leucine just to make sure that I", "129:41", "was kick-starting that whole recovery", "129:44", "process because as soon as you got out", "129:45", "of the water after six hours there's", "129:47", "always the temptation just I want to", "129:48", "pass out I want to just go to bed I want", "129:50", "you know and it's just like no you've", "129:52", "got now what about your protein what", "129:56", "you're getting it mostly from a lot of", "129:58", "whey protein deficiency and also as well", "130:01", "you've got to think in terms of the boat", "130:04", "and Stocking food like a perishable you", "130:07", "know food so you know as much as I love", "130:09", "my barbecue ribs and everything", "130:11", "like that that wasn't gonna happen wrong", "130:13", "this small galley that we had on the", "130:15", "boat right so did you get any fresh food", "130:17", "eggs anything along those lines we did", "130:19", "yeah when we could stop in a harbor", "130:21", "would you know the team would go out I", "130:22", "never touch land but they could go and", "130:24", "quickly provision from land and bring a", "130:25", "bat but ultimately yeah it would it was", "130:28", "trying to find a way that was was", "130:31", "sustainable as possible that within the", "130:34", "parameters that we had", "130:36", "yeah and that was what was tricky what", "130:38", "about your joints I would imagine", "130:41", "repetitive stress of swimming would", "130:44", "wreak havoc on your shoulders yeah and", "130:47", "that's why this goes back to I suppose", "130:50", "this goes back and I lost a chance a", "130:52", "rich role about this actually where once", "130:54", "she developed that sort of horsepower", "130:57", "program that work capacity that was", "130:59", "talking about before from when I ran the", "131:01", "marathon pulling a car it was this is", "131:04", "such a strange story but I then there", "131:05", "again to raise money for that for the", "131:07", "Teenage Cancer Trust I I climbed a rope", "131:10", "but I think it was a 10 meter rope but I", "131:12", "repeatedly climbed it until I climbed", "131:14", "the height of Everest", "131:15", "so it was 8,848 meters and it was that", "131:19", "that actually taught me the movement", "131:22", "efficiency plays such an important role", "131:24", "in terms of endurance because you you", "131:27", "could be you could have the best", "131:28", "muscular endurance the world cardio", "131:30", "spirit injuries but if you can imagine", "131:31", "with a rope climb if you're solely", "131:34", "relying on your

going to give like the", "131:44", "weakest part so you'll write from that I", "131:47", "had the work capacity from the marathon", "131:49", "then from the rope climb I certainly", "131:51",

I", "132:07", "almost looked asleep but you know it was", "132:09", "really rolling and that's why I asked", "132:11", "you about swimming and even looking at a", "132:13", "bird again to use hims up

up that's a weird angle for that", "145:22", "kick very tight yeah yeah very tightly", "145:25", "and it wasn't a round it was straight so", "145:27", "it was basically like a jump spinning", "145:30", "back kick to the chin she's hard to", "145:32", "generate force", "145:33", "oh no no no no power yeah no as long as", "145:38", "he can get extension on his legs it's", "145:40", "just he had a jump and talk and spin", "145:43", "but the fact that he chose that angle", "145:46", "it's like he realized that the guy was", "145:47", "gonna see things that were coming around", "145:49", "yeah", "145:50", "so instead of coming around he had it", "145:52", "come up and and through the middle right", "145:55", "which is which made it much sneakier but", "145:58", "that's what we described me now is it", "146:00", "never intangible right yeah in", "146:02", "creativity yeah exactly I mean and what", "146:05", "I found it so interesting when you know", "146:08", "McGregor and

on I want to say Kimmel but I don't", "146:19", "think it was he was on a chat show and", "146:21", "he was talking about that spinning", "146:22", "capoeira Crescent yeah and he actually", "146:25", "did it he performed it and I was like", "146:26", "look if he lands that you know the same", "146:29", "way with Aldo would be like that is the", "146:31", "movement is is it you know you don't", "146:33", "forget cardiorespiratory endurance", "146:35", "strength everything that we talked about", "146:37", "there the metric saying you know heavy", "146:38", "what you got to be two four five you", "146:40", "know whatever the Milan no it's just", "146:41", "movement he would've reinvented again", "146:44", "well and I mean come is wrong I think", "146:46", "with yes he did try it didn't he and it", "146:48", "missed I think um I believe he did", "146:51", "through it I think he through it the", "146:53", "thing you know that technique is a legit", "146:56", "technique obviously wheel kicks most", "146:58", "certainly works yeah but it's not a high", "147:01", "percentage technique it doesn't it so", "147:03", "there's only been a few wheel kick", "147:05", "knockouts in in the UFC

"147:23", "you don't expect it right but that's but", "147:26", "but can you tell when someone has it and", "147:28", "doesn't is because it's an intangible so", "147:30", "if you said if at the start of the you", "147:33", "know barbozza and Etem fight you said", "147:35", "you know knockout by timing your", "147:37", "creativity you'd say like what would you", "147:40", "mean you know but if you could foresee", "147:42", "that the same way that you could", "147:43", "quantify that sort of mental fortitude", "147:46", "I think you start opening the door in", "147:48", "sports performance into
