access", "61:49", "over these projects he didn't want to", "61:51", "talk about it because then it shows the", "61:52", "fact that our democracy has been side", "61:55", "lined as Eisenhower warned us

who was kind of the chief", "62:53", "steward for Air Force one who I know and", "62:56", "he said I know about this but the whole", "63:00", "matter is the President Kennedy saying", "63:02", "this the whole matter is out of my hands", "63:03", "and I don't know why and this guy was", "63:07", "stunned in fact I'll tell you there's a", "63:09", "kind of a gruff Colonel Air Force guy", "63:11",

how are you going", "63:41", "to get this story out and that's why I", "63:43", "mean a few years ago I left medicine", "63:46", "which was a hard thing for me to do", "63:49", "because I mean I really love taking care", "63:51", "of you know real emergencies and trauma", "63:53", "how long did you do that for", "63:54", "hmm I was in that er of ten years and I", "63:56", "was chairman of

see one and we're in deep proper", "64:10", "trouble and and so someone has to do", "64:12", "this and but before I did that what you", "64:14", "have to understand is I went to everyone", "64:16", "I could I mean I went to these powerful", "64:18", "people I went to the UN and I went to", "64:20", "the British government the Ministry of", "64:21", "Defence and basically none of them", "64:24", "doubted this was all true frankly this", "64:27", "is what people need to understand there", "64:28", "was no laughter in the room they took it", "64:31", "very seriously but they didn't want to", "64:33", "stick their necks out and a friend of", "64:34", "mine who's a big business guy he said", "64:36", "well you know the way the world works", "64:38", "now everyone wants to be first to be", "64:40", "second when it's something tough I've", "64:43", "always felt that something along the", "64:45", "lines of alien contact if if they did", "64:48", "have information there's no reason to", "64:51", "let people know unless it's unavoidable", "64:54", "I always felt like unless they were just", "64:56", "gonna try to do some damage control and", "64:59", "redefine what's happening I didn't I", "65:02", "wouldn't think that they would ever come", "65:03", "out about it it just doesn't seem like", "65:05", "it would be something that would be", "65:07", "advantageous to just start

"65:23", "because so many people I mean between", "65:25", "five and ten percent of public have seen", "65:27", "one of these objects many of them very", "65:28", "close range let's get back to that", "65:30", "because this is what we had talked about", "65:32", "before when we got onto this people", "65:34", "think the earth is ten thousand years", "65:35", "old I think most of what people see is", "65:38", "bullshit I think most yeah yeah no", "65:41", "question about that most sightings I I", "65:45", "did a show once for CBS called game show", "65:47", "in my head and it was a hidden-camera", "65:50", "game show I would put it earpiece in", "65:53", "people's head and we were send them out", "65:55", "onto the street and they didn't know", "65:57", "what they had to do until they got there", "65:58", "and", "65:58", "we we said okay see that camera over", "66:01", "there that's where that works for you", "66:02", "there was a big news camera you're a", "66:04", "news reporter and there was just a UFO", "66:07", "sighting right above Hollywood Boulevard", "66:10", "the problem is the witness took off so", "66:13", "you need to grab someone who wasn't",

them", "66:24", "to tell you that they were abducted and", "66:26", "probed and I'm Sarah and we got people", "66:29", "to do it like that well yeah no I have", "66:31", "no doubt but you can do a shit yeah you", "66:33", "can you can always do that but I'm", "66:35", "talking about high-level military and", "66:37", "the residual I mean for example we have", "66:40", "multiple air of pilots for commercial", "66:44", "airlines and the Air Force and this is", "66:47", "one of the really great cases we have by", "66:49", "the way the Japan Airlines case over", "66:51", "Alaska in the 80s and the guy who is in", "66:54", "charge of investigations for the FAA it", "66:57", "was third from the top during the Reagan", "66:59", "era he actually left that agency and", "67:03", "brought the

was on civilian radar which way it", "67:18", "was on military radar they scrambled", "67:21", "f-16s it was on their radar and the", "67:24", "Japan Airlines 747 pilot has testified", "67:27", "to it and we have all of that in this", "67:29", "case I've noted this okay all right so", "67:32", "when we brought all that forward and", "67:34", "this guy came for he says I'm one of", "67:35", "these high-level government officials", "67:37", "who actually has seen all this and has", "67:39", "handled it but no one's asking the right", "67:41", "questions so when you pull all that", "67:44", "together and and then of course there", "67:46", "will be events like the this thing that", "67:48", "happened in Phoenix where you know", "67:49", "eventually the Governor of Arizona Fife", "67:53", "Symington came out later and at the time", "67:54", "he ridiculed it but he had actually seen", "67:56", "it and came out later ten years later in", "67:59", "2007 said yeah that was an ET craft", "68:01", "almost certainly and I saw it and tens", "68:03", "of thousands of people in the Phoenix", "68:05", "area saw it and it was photographed and", "68:07", "it was on radar and there were very", "68:09", "trained people so you know you have to", "68:11", "ask the question how many", "68:12", "like that have to happen and you know on", "68:15", "the other hand you know the things that", "68:17", "we have in physics that are that are", "68:19", "inferred through indirect measurements", "68:21", "like black holes or articles of belief", "68:24", "and faith or even the Big Bang Theory",

"68:32", "radar cases you have all this and so a", "68:34", "lot of this is what's going to be in the", "68:35", "film serious and because what I said to", "68:37", "people is that the fact that people", "68:39", "haven't seen this evidence doesn't mean", "68:41", "that it doesn't exist it does exist I", "68:43", "agree with you there are a lot of people", "68:46", "who will see things and

there are a lot", "68:56", "of things that are UFO sightings that", "68:58", "are very legit and that's why I don't", "69:01", "like the word UFO there are two", "69:02", "categories of UFOs that once you", "69:04", "eliminate all the nonsense you're", "69:05", "talking about and they're the ones that", "69:08", "are ATVs which is what they're called", "69:09", "the NSA extraterrestrial vehicles

the", "139:24", "film director and his crew were out", "139:26", "there last June a few months ago in 2012", "139:28", "when we had this disc fly over and then", "139:31", "a jet came in to intercept it and just", "139:32", "and that's gonna be in the film it's", "139:34", "really cool you have a video of that or", "139:36", "a moto that both really so you have a", "139:39", "video of this disc in the sky and then a", "139:41", "jet approaching a discount this be", "139:43", "coming out Colorado Springs so it's", "139:44", "coming out of that direction but yeah", "139:46", "it's really pretty cool and of course I", "139:48", "think when when the director saw this he", "139:49", "went wow and who put this video together", "139:52", "who made it who filmed it the film crew", "139:55", "the first serious so you Wow", "140:01", "so you know you have this you have like", "140:03", "we don't want to make sure that was real", "140:04", "clear this you have thousands of these", "140:06", "videos where there's one yeah if you go", "140:08", "again to this website you'll see that", "140:10", "there's a section for the with the", "140:12", "contact expeditions and the c-5", "140:14", "expeditions and a couple years ago we", "140:16", "were up till now there's a mountain", "140:18", "north of here called Mount Shasta", "140:20", "near the Oregon border in the Cascade", "140:22", "Range and and it's a volcanic Mountain", "140:24", "and we've gone up there a number of", "140:25", "years and we've had these objects that", "140:27", "have appeared and one of them was", "140:30", "actually in the field", "140:32", "we had our night-vision camera running", "140:33", "and it lifts it up and does this and", "140:36", "then there's like this corkscrew and", "140:37", "dematerialize", "140:38", "in the sky we have this on videotape and", "140:40", "it was during one of these expeditions", "140:41", "and it's a really amazing bit of video", "140:44", "is ball lightning a real phenomena oh", "140:48", "yes sure sure and that's not this is", "140:50", "clear skies no weather but coming up", "140:52", "from the ground but don't they but but", "140:55", "doesn't ball lightning to have something", "140:57", "to do with there's there's certain types", "140:59", "of visual phenomenon that have to do", "141:01", "with tectonic plates and pressure and", "141:04", "stress piezoelectric yeah what do you", "141:06", "know what that's very different also", "141:07", "that'll be just sort of a discharge like", "141:09", "an electrical dish or see it and that's", "141:10", "from the rocks and usually it's when", "141:12", "there's quartz the pressure of it and an", "141:14", "electromagnetic energy will build up and", "141:16", "it'll burst out but you know this is an", "141:18", "object and you can see it quite clearly", "141:19", "and it's though it's right at the edge", "141:21", "of the speed of light because it's kind", "141:23", "of coming in and out of this dimension", "141:24", "it's a really great video and there were", "141:26", "like 3040 people who saw this happen so", "141:29", "we do this I've been doing this for 22", "141:31", "years and what people do you show up", "141:35", "there Brian what is a was one of these", "141:37", "objects that came over I think that was", "141:39", "at melchester I'm not sure it's my laser", "141:41", "and it's this object that came right", "141:42", "over and you know we also trained people", "141:44", "to always go out with satellite charts", "141:46", "know what you know so you know when the", "141:48", "settle this is your footage mm-hmm of", "141:50", "this thing flying in the sky yep whoa", "141:53", "and that's your laser that's my I have a", "141:55", "big you know it's a one of these I got", "141:57", "one of those yeah it'll go well it'll go", "141:59", "100 200 miles into space do now when you", "142:03", "when you were filming this are you", "142:05", "trying to contact them like what each", "142:06", "other we had so we do the protocols", "142:08", "where you do the remote viewing set up", "142:10", "the vector to show them where you are we", "142:12", "play these electronic tones in the space", "142:14", "and then have electronic field detectors", "142:16", "out there so we'll have magnetic-field", "142:18", "detectors various laser detectors other", "142:22", "electromagnetic spectrum and those will", "142:24", "begin to go off and then we'll have an", "142:26", "object fly over like this object here", "142:28", "that was right near us it comes to", "142:29", "Triton outside so what people have to", "142:31", "understand is that if you have an object", "142:35", "that is coming in and out of dimensions", "142:40", "it's not going to necessarily look like", "142:42", "a 747 or even a flying saucer it's going", "142:45", "to be in various inter", "142:46", "forms and this is the weird sort of", "142:48", "effect most people don't

happens when you go", "143:00", "beyond the speed of light all right", "143:02", "you're gonna not have anything visible", "143:04", "but if you begin to have an energy", "143:05", "discharge into an area of space and it's", "143:08", "very close to this dimension you'll", "143:10", "start to give off an energy field our", "143:12", "corona and so one of the witnesses we", "143:15", "have was at a nuclear hot base out in", "143:18", "Oklahoma Becca years ago I think was in", "143:20", "the 70s and there was this object that", "143:23", "was in the shape of UFO but it wasn't", "143:24", "solid and it flew over the what they", "143:27", "call the hot you know with the Jets were", "143:28", "hot loaded with nuclear weapons and the", "143:30", "alarms went off he says this thing was", "143:32", "not solid like this is like your rock", "143:35", "salt it was you could have walked right", "143:38", "through it but it was in the shape of a", "143:40", "craft but it was shifted so that the", "143:43", "matter was all energy and of course", "143:45", "matter is energy so the physics behind", "143:47", "this gets into some really arcane stuff", "143:50", "probably beyond the scope of the show", "143:51", "but it's what I this is part of what", "143:54", "we're teaching people when we take them", "143:55", "out is how do these objects appear what", "143:59", "might you see and I was talking to an", "144:02", "actor here in town who had one of these", "144:04", "happen near his home and it was very", "144:09", "palpable very real but it wasn't he tell", "144:12", "us who the actor was no throat it no", "144:16", "there no but he you know these are there", "144:18", "a lot of people who've had these sort of", "144:19", "experiences they don't want to talk", "144:20",

"144:30", "really I said yeah", "144:31", "because if it's if it's not a Lockheed", "144:34", "Martin you know anti-gravity and it's", "144:38", "really a CT the weirder it is the more", "144:40", "likely it is to be et and this gets into", "144:44", "the whole question what are you looking", "144:45", "for so we trained people to know kind of", "144:47", "what to look for versus you know if", "144:50", "experimental aircraft normal aircraft", "144:52", "you know space objects and junk", "144:55", "satellites and then the stuff that's", "144:58", "the weird end of it so the weird end of",

and in that area where this", "156:18", "had happened there was this beam that", "156:21", "was up and did you see this with your", "156:24", "eyes or just no because this would have", "156:26", "been

like", "159:04", "people there are reports of that and in", "159:08", "fact reports of that and I think there's", "159:10", "a you believe that though oh yeah I", "159:12", "think Stan Romanek if you look at the", "159:14", "photograph he had of this thing I think", "159:18", "he was on Larry King or and some other", "159:19", "shows in this thing boo that goes up and", "159:21", "down he's got a
