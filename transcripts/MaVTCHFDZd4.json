"there's no that's real damage like he", "09:48", "went out cold instantly and then he got", "09:51", "punched in the face twice it's part of", "09:53", "what it's terrible but it's part of what", "09:56", "makes the sport so exciting is that you", "09:58", "realize these guys are so brave to face", "10:00", "these potential consequences you know", "10:03", "makes it it makes it it's like an added", "10:05", "element of danger that makes it exciting", "10:07", "it's very true but it's man I feel so", "10:12", "bad for him with that when I saw that", "10:13", "because it kind of brought back memories", "10:14", "for myself I was like ah I know exactly", "10:17", "what that moment feels like I don't", "10:18", "remember it but I know exactly what that", "10:20", "moment feels like

like you know in those movies", "10:30", "when it goes it was at this very moment", "10:33", "he fucked up and out like a light man", "10:41", "and I didn't like come to and like I", "10:43", "mean I woke up but I didn't come to like", "10:45", "actually remember like shit I wasn't a", "10:47", "fist fight and I lost like really bad", "10:49", "like really quick when I got to a", "10:52", "hospital", "10:53", "that's when you realized it yeah I heard", "10:54", "Ben say the same thing I was like this", "10:56", "is not just me I guess it's just a", "10:57", "really bad knock out him shooting", "10:59", "forward and Maz Vidale jumping into him", "11:01", "like a car crash man in monster dolls", "11:03", "running full clip that's a 40-yard dash", "11:07", "running full clip and perfect placement", "11:11", "the knee I mean you don't get a cleaner", "11:12", "knockout no and just the way he did it", "11:15", "like he was showing the video of him", "11:17", "practicing it and saying he had like", "11:19", "three different scenarios of how that", "11:20", "situation could have went that's like", "11:23", "masterful thinking tactical like there's", "11:26", "not a lot of people who are that's to", "11:27", "reboot when it comes to the game and I", "11:28", "think the way he broke that down was", "11:30", "just super impressive and he kind of", "11:31", "lulled him to sleep like his hands", "11:32", "behind his back I loved every second of", "11:34", "that because you weren't sure what was", "11:35", "about to happen I was on the edge of my", "11:37", "seat that was my main event fight and", "11:39", "then he just comes out takes a side", "11:40", "stuff like just drifts off to the right", "11:42", "and then boom 40-yard dash and finding", "11:45", "chaos it was just as much a main event", "11:47", "for me too because it's so important for", "11:49", "the welterweight division", "11:51", "yeah whereas like John Jones versus", "11:53", "Thiago Santos it was an interesting", "11:54", "fight and turned out to be a great fight", "11:56", "but it was an interesting fight because", "11:58", "you're like okay how is John Jones gonna", "12:00", "beat this guy and is this guy gonna be", "12:02", "wild enough to catch John Jones but when", "12:04", "you looked at it on paper John was a", "12:05", "prohibitive favorite yeah when you", "12:07", "looked at a screen versus moskvin all", "12:09", "you're like man I don't know yeah when I", "12:11", "looked at Holly and Amanda I'm like", "12:13", "Holly's a great champion and she's a", "12:14", "great fighter but Amanda's so goddamn", "12:16", "good it's almost like she doesn't have", "12:18", "anybody else left to fight it's not like", "12:20", "Holly had made this incredible case for", "12:22", "her being the one to challenge Amanda", "12:24", "next it was just that Amanda's kind of", "12:26", "cleaned out that bantamweight division", "12:27", "yeah she fought one person she beat me", "12:30", "and Anderson and I felt like she", "12:31", "struggled with that fight the only way", "12:33", "she I felt like she done really well", "12:35", "when she was able to get Megan down to", "12:37", "the ground but when she was in a clinch", "12:38", "she ate a lot of knees this is Holly and", "12:40", "and she tried to do the same thing the", "12:42", "previous fight was cyborg and she ate a", "12:44", "lot of knees in the clinch trying to", "12:46", "slow cyborg down it just didn't work out", "12:47", "in a favor so when that matchup was", "12:49", "announced I was like", "12:50", "Holly's gonna either stay on her bike", "12:51", "the entire time and just try to point", "12:53", "fight or it's just not gonna end up good", "12:55", "and sure enough that's what happened", "12:57", "yeah I thought she was gonna probably", "12:58", "try to stay on her bike as well and", "13:00", "throw kicks from the outside but I guess", "13:01", "a man that had planned for it that's why", "13:03", "she caught her with her leg up", "13:06", "you know if you see the way she landed", "13:07", "that round kick she caught her with her", "13:08", "leg up like she was like like pressing", "13:10", "with that side kick and then boom yeah", "13:13", "that roundhouse kicked right across the", "13:14", "top and Holly is such a good girl she's", "13:16", "such a good person yeah I was almost too", "13:19", "nice but then you feel bad for yeah but", "13:22", "I know what you mean is she did I she", "13:24", "didn't make a great case like you said", "13:26", "for the title fight but there was really", "13:28", "no one else for her to there's nobody", "13:30", "well once she beat up Raquel Pennington", "13:32", "the way she did and then when she goes", "13:34", "up and destroys cyborg it's like who", "13:36", "else is there", "13:37", "I mean Raquel Pennington is like as", "13:39", "tough as they come yeah and she she was", "13:41", "battering her the way she wished she put", "13:44", "away Ronda the way she put away Mischa", "13:46", "she just smashes people it's scary I", "13:49", "think it's it's her", "13:50", "Siobhan Coe cyborg and then everybody", "13:53", "else I think you're a hundred percent", "13:54", "right I think that's an interesting", "13:56", "fight she might just saw I don't know if", "13:58", "she can make 125 but if she just I don't", "14:01", "know she's a big girl yeah but if she", "14:03", "decides or Shevchenko decides to step up", "14:06", "one more time to 135 and tries to become", "14:08", "champ champ and beat her I mean they had", "14:10", "a really fucking close fight especially", "14:12", "that second fight yeah if I was very", "14:14", "very close I didn't know how to even", "14:16", "really score for but uh yeah and", "14:18", "Valentina made a case at the end that", "14:19", "she thought that she had won but it was", "14:20", "a very good fight as Shevchenko", "14:23", "obviously when you see her knock out", "14:24", "Jessica who used to be a top", "14:26", "bantamweight contender herself she's one", "14:28", "of the rare girls that like Amanda and", "14:30", "like cyborg can flatline women with one", "14:33", "shot the scary man is scary those those", "14:36", "ladies hit hard yeah and her kicking", "14:39", "technique is just exemplary you know I'm", "14:42", "a Valentino it's just so good on

initial time", "102:28", "period then from there you have a chance", "102:31", "to you go at it for a certain amount of", "102:33", "time still someone gets tapped and you", "102:35", "start out in

just really didn't like that much", "103:07", "was uh the back control position because", "103:10", "you see a lot of the times the guys will", "103:12", "escape and let the guy end up in mount",

lot of", "104:18", "the pathways he creates a lot of control", "104:21", "yeah there's no rocking yeah exactly", "104:23", "look even here even here he still got", "104:25", "that leg he still got that leg and you", "104:28", "were always in a bad spot with a guy", "104:30", "like Gio who's a he's an armbar while", "104:32", "he's it just to Jiu Jitsu master but", "104:34", "what weight is this 45 I think it's 45 I", "104:37", "believe and Gio like his brother Richie", "104:41", "they started out as break dancers these", "104:44", "guys are strong as fuck they're crazy", "104:47", "physical

that", "105:11", "spiderweb and now he's got like a figure", "105:12", "four but he had a fig for us like a", "105:15", "little loose now but he had it was yes", "105:16", "really loose it's called the arm crush", "105:18", "yeah so he was going for like an biceps", "105:20", "mm-hmm okay", "105:21", "and then really it almost snaps your", "105:24", "forearm nice socks", "105:25", "tremendous
