just it wasn't doing that as", "07:56", "much or I was noticing it I was noticing", "07:59", "I was missing that or wanting it more I", "08:01", "think that's really what it comes from", "08:02", "is growing as a person and realizing I", "08:06", "think everybody's afraid to take chances", "08:08", "and do something new in their life", "08:09", "because they're identified a certain way", "08:11",

and", "09:26", "from pretty bad shape it was like bee", "09:29", "stings it was like he got a new lease of", "09:30", "life like he got a big dose locally in", "09:34", "the hip which fixed all his
