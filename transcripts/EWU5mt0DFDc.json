very famous", "101:29", "where times of cars speeding around the", "101:32", "Nurburgring has always been like the", "101:33", "benchmark okay like denial four-minute", "101:35", "mile it's a big deal like I have a gt3", "101:37", "RS which is a like really essentially a", "101:40", "race car for the street and that", "101:41", "supposedly goes around the Nurburgring I", "101:46", "think somewhere in the neighborhood of", "101:47", "seven minutes and forty something", "101:50", "seconds this K new Tesla just did it's", "101:53", "seven minutes and 20 seconds oh wow", "101:55", "that's so that's 20 plus seconds faster", "101:58", "yeah Porsche race car that's insane", "102:01", "because it doesn't have to shift doesn't", "102:03", "have to shift and it has this crazy", "102:05", "power the power and the acceleration", "102:08", "it's not like anything I've ever", "102:09", "experienced in my life I've had all", "102:11", "kinds of muscle cars I've got all kinds", "102:13", "of different things like you know I've", "102:16", "had big cars and small cars that thing", "102:18", "is a totally different animal yeah", "102:20", "animal this is all news to me I thought", "102:22", "it Tesla went bankrupt", "102:24", "it's fucking nuts you're doing these", "102:26", "shows tonight yeah I'll bring it and", "102:28", "then what roads will drive it at all", "102:30", "don't do words for me I don't know you", "102:32", "need experience all right I appreciate a", "102:34", "Salesman yeah apparently it's capable of", "102:38", "doing that seventh oh hey we did it", "102:40", "no what do you mean it says it's", "102:42", "possible it broke it did a 724 there", "102:46", "right now broke the brokedown win during", "102:48", "the race what what it's not a Rory", "102:51", "during the time trial well they", "102:53", "definitely for sleeve one they complete", "102:56", "Porsche passed them with are they racing", "102:58", "watch a video of the Porsche passing a", "102:59", "brokedown Tesla on the Nurburgring that", "103:01", "is that this is bad today's Tesla like", "103:04", "that they're doing okay this is worse", "103:07", "for Elon than the weed smoking no it", "103:09", "makes sense", "103:10", "all right you if you're going around a", "103:12", "track on a car that has a it's all", "103:15", "batteries and heats up they they had", "103:17", "real concerns about that this is their", "103:19", "tweet says it can't achieve it it didn't", "103:21", "say it achieve it well how do we know if", "103:23", "it can if it didn't data from our track", "103:25", "tech indicates but I thought they had a", "103:27", "second one what are some improvements", "103:29", "705 may be possible but they definitely", "103:31", "did 723 or something like that which is", "103:34", "still insanely impressive yeah yeah pull", "103:37", "up", "103:38", "Nurburgring laps a Tesla 723 but", "103:42", "no there's more than one test this was", "103:44", "the second they started doing it a", "103:46", "couple of days ago mm-hmm what they're", "103:48", "trying to do is beat Porsches electric", "103:50", "car Porsche has his badass new electric", "103:52", "car that they just came out to take on", "103:54", "yeah minute one test that completed that", "103:56", "lap a very on official time of 7:23 how", "103:59", "did you say very unofficial it says very", "104:01", "unofficial how's that mean so like they", "104:03", "probably left it to Tesla to measure it", "104:05", "maybe right that's probably it means not", "104:07", "a judge how do you know anything about", "104:10", "Nurburgring I just from playing video", "104:12", "games in the video game tracks it's a", "104:14", "dope track in this video game do they", "104:17", "make you do they have an official that", "104:20", "gives you like the ready set go", "104:22", "like how do they do that I'd be like the", "104:24", "video game Grand Turismo yeah yeah that", "104:28", "makes sense like you would have to have", "104:30", "an official you couldn't trust you know", "104:32", "like what companies lie about how much", "104:35", "their gas like guzzlers right cars I", "104:38", "didn't didn't that happen Volkswagen", "104:40", "they lied about the gas mileage they got", "104:42", "in trouble a that was it emissions or", "104:43", "gas mileage I think was emissions yes", "104:46", "right so companies will lot still", "104:47", "definitely live up to acceleration", "104:49", "informal a timed informally timed on the", "104:51", "circuit at 7:23 stop watch was timing", "104:55", "but made by a correspondent of the", "104:56", "German publication Auto Motor and sport", "104:58", "okay so they at least had a journalist", "105:01", "that was doing it the Tesla did have the", "105:03", "advantage of using race compound tires", "105:05", "doesn't account for the almost twenty", "105:07", "second advantage over the Porsche ty can", "105:09", "mmm besides lap times 7 42 yeah they're", "105:13", "a burger I've got another way even the", "105:15", "Porsche one that's 742 that is fucking", "105:17", "insanely fast for a four-door car yes", "105:20", "mainly crazy so they're all insanely", "105:22", "fast and if you could find the", "105:24", "difference between the Tesla and the", "105:25", "Porsche in daily driving I think you're", "105:27", "an asshole because you're probably", "105:28", "driving way too fucking fast you know", "105:31", "you could tell the difference between", "105:32", "723 which is insane yeah 747 right that", "105:37", "sucks it broke down though well I think", "105:39", "those things overheat uh-uh I think", "105:42", "you're not supposed to drive them like", "105:43", "that I think you're supposed to drive", "105:44", "them like you would drive a regular car", "105:46", "still pretty cool that it did it no it's", "105:48", "it's pretty incredible and this is like", "105:51", "the the reality of electric cars is that",

"106:12", "like the amount of juice you can get out", "106:14", "of a battery yeah if they did that and", "106:16", "had them like thousands of miles of", "106:18", "range instead of like the really good", "106:21", "one today I think is like 315 I think is", "106:25", "the most you can get 315 miles okay but", "106:28", "that's if you don't drive like a dick", "106:29", "right right well let me sorry Jamie I", "106:32", "just recently heard through something I", "106:34", "was looking up someone else mentioned on", "106:35", "the podcast that I did sudden about", "106:37", "solid state batteries being worked on", "106:39", "right now have you ever heard anything", "106:40", "about that", "106:40", "no it sounds like it would be useful for", "106:42", "this I don't even understand his stall", "106:44", "what does that mean I don't know it's", "106:45", "like how solid-state hard drives are", "106:47", "completely different from hard drive", "106:50", "just maybe the same kind of thing I", "106:52", "don't that's where I'd really didn't", "106:53", "understand I was looking it up and I", "106:55", "felt like I felt a simulation because", "106:56", "the guys name is good enough the", "106:58", "scientist is 97 years old and he's done", "107:03", "a bunch of I mean how much think about", "107:06", "how much you need batteries and how", "107:07", "little do you know
