is that", "10:54", "there's a mix of fear of that of that", "10:58", "unknown of creative", "10:59", "known and an excitement for it because", "11:02", "there's something in human nature that",

problem is", "11:58", "so I started with more philosophy almost", "12:02", "it's where if you think Sam Harris is", "12:06", "the last couple of years has started", "12:08", "kind of thinking about artificial", "12:09", "intelligence and he has a back on you", "12:13", "know science but he's also a philosopher", "12:15", "and I started there by reading Camus and", "12:17", "Nietzsche or

different", "14:30", "version of it which was not able to", "14:32", "create and the one that was not able to", "14:34", "create was much more of more of a", "14:36", "servant and there's this battle

2001", "14:48", "Space Odyssey sort of you've seen ex", "14:51", "machina yeah I seen it so because of", "14:53", "your I've listened to your podcast and", "14:55", "because because of it I've watched his", "14:57", "second time because the first time I", "14:59", "watched it and Neil deGrasse Tyson", "15:00", "moment where it was you said there's cut", "15:03", "be cut the cut the shit got the shit", "15:06", "moments yes for me for me the it did the", "15:10", "movie opening is everything everything", "15:13", "about it was", "15:14", "I was rolling my eyes why are you", "15:16", "rolling your eyes what was a cut that", "15:18", "shit moment so that's a general bad", "15:22", "tendency that I'd like to talk about", "15:24", "amongst people who are scientists that", "15:26", "are

"15:47", "machina no spoiler alerts is in the", "15:51", "middle what like a Jurassic Park type", "15:53", "situation where is like in the middle of", "15:55", "land that yawns yeah we don't really",

inside", "16:05", "this compound he appears to be working", "16:07", "alone right and he's like literally he's", "16:09", "like doing curls I think like dumbbells", "16:12", "and drinking heavily",

blissfully ignorant yeah so I", "16:55", "watched it I go this movie's awesome", "16:57", "yeah and you're like I know too much", "16:59", "yeah and not too much but that's that's", "17:02", "a stupid way to think for me so once you", "17:05", "suspend disbelief say okay well right", "17:07", "those are those are not important", "17:09", "details yeah but it is important I mean", "17:11", "they could have gone to you or someone", "17:12", "who really has knowledge in it and", "17:14", "cleaned up those small aspects and still", "17:16", "kept the the theme of the story that's", "17:19", "right they could have but they would", "17:21", "make a different movie so but slightly", "17:24", "friend I don't know if it's possible to", "17:26", "make so you look at 2001 Space Odyssey I", "17:29", "don't know if you've seen them yes", "17:30", "that's the kind of movie you'll start if", "17:33", "you talk to scientists that you'll start", "17:35", "making those kinds of movies because you", "17:39", "can't actually use jargon that makes", "17:41", "sense because we don't know how to build", "17:43", "a lot of these systems so the way you", "17:45", "need to film it and talk about it is", "17:47", "with mystery it's this Hitchcock right", "17:49", "type like you almost you say very little", "17:52", "yes leave it to your imagination to see", "17:55", "what happens", "17:56", "yeah here everything was in the open", "17:58", "right even with in terms of the actual", "18:00", "construction of the brain that when they", "18:02", "had that foam looking and whatever gel", "18:06", "brain right yeah he said that if they", "18:08", "gave a little bit more subtle mystery I", "18:12", "think I would've heard that movie a lot", "18:13", "more but the second time really because", "18:15", "of you you say I think it's your", "18:17", "favorite sci-fi movie it's absolutely", "18:19", "one of my favorites I had one of my", "18:21", "favorite movies period I loved it", "18:23", "yeah so I I watched it again and also", "18:26", "Sam Harris said that he also hated the", "18:31", "movie and then washed again and liked it", "18:32", "so I gave it so I get I give it a chance", "18:35", "why would you see a movie again after", "18:37", "you hate it because maybe you're", "18:42", "self-aware enough to think there's", "18:44", "something unhealthy about the way I", "18:45", "hated the movie hmm like you're like", "18:48", "introspective enough to know it's like I", "18:52", "have the same experience with Batman", "18:53", "okay I watched which one Dark Knight I", "18:58", "think Christian Bale Christian Bale and", "19:00", "so to me the first time I watched that", "19:04", "is a guy in a costume like speaking", "19:08", "excessively with an excessively low", "19:10", "voice I mean it's just something sit", "19:12", "with like little bunny ear not bunny", "19:14", "ears but little ears it's so silly but", "19:17", "then you go back and okay if we just", "19:19", "accept that those that's the reality of", "19:22", "the world we live in", "19:23", "what's the human nature aspects that are", "19:26", "being explored here what is the the",

if you can just suspend", "19:42", "that that's beautiful now I get the", "19:44", "movie can become quite fun to watch but", "19:47", "still unto me not to offend anybody but", "19:51", "that superhero movies are difficult", "19:54", "still difficult for me to watch yeah who", "19:56", "was talking about that recently was it", "20:00", "Kelly Kelly Slater no yesterday", "20:03", "yesterday

anybody could do that voice yeah so", "20:27", "but I contradict I'm I'm a hypocrite", "20:31", "because Game of Thrones or Tolkien's", "20:35", "Lord of the Rings I'm a talk it's", "20:39", "totally

time like Star", "21:11", "Wars is harder for me and you're saying", "21:13", "Star Wars is a little more real because", "21:15", "it's it feels feasible like you could", "21:18", "have spaceships

advance", "22:36", "but the problem is a lot of movie", "22:38", "producers think that they're smarter", "22:40", "than people they just decide I just put", "22:42", "it in there the average person is not", "22:43", "gonna care I've had that conversation", "22:44", "with movie producers about martial arts", "22:46", "and I was like well this is just", "22:48", "nonsense you can't do that", "22:50",

that", "24:20", "Kubrick faked the moon landing goes from", "24:23", "the little boy having the rocket ship on", "24:25", "his sweater to the the number of the", "24:29", "number of the room that things happened", "24:32", "this is like a bunch of like very", "24:34", "bizarre connections in the film that", "24:36", "Kubrick unquestionably engineered", "24:39", "because he was just a stupid

interesting I mean", "25:05", "but that probably speaks to the reality", "25:07", "of Hollywood today that the cut the shit", "25:12", "moments don't affect the bottom line of", "25:14", "how much the movie makes well thien", "25:16", "really depends on the film right I mean", "25:18", "the cut the shit moments that Neil", "25:19", "deGrasse Tyson found in gravity I didn't", "25:22", "see because I

so angry he reads the negative", "26:01", "comments as we've talked about yeah I", "26:04", "actually recently because of doing a lot", "26:07", "of work with artificial intelligence and", "26:09",

that's the camp I kind", "28:21", "of sit in and a lot of those folks tend", "28:24", "to roll their eyes and just not engage", "28:26", "in Chinese discussion in the future", "28:27", "their idea is", "28:29", "is saying it's really hard to do what", "28:33", "we're doing and it's just really hard to", "28:35", "see how this becomes intelligent and", "28:39", "then there's another group of people who", "28:40", "say yeah baby you're being very", "28:42", "short-sighted that you may not be able", "28:45", "to do much now but the exponential the", "28:50", "hard take off but you know overnight it", "28:52", "can become super intelligent and then", "28:54", "it'll be too late to think about mm-hmm", "28:56", "the problem with those two camps", "28:58", "as with any camps Democrat Republic any", "29:01", "camps is they don't seem maybe seem to", "29:04", "be talking past each other as opposed to", "29:06", "both have really interesting ideas if", "29:09", "you go back to the analogy of touch of", "29:13", "death of this this idea of MMA right so", "29:18", "I'm the in this analogy I'm gonna put", "29:20", "myself in the UFC for a second in this", "29:23", "analogy I'm you know like ranked in the", "29:25", "top 20 I'm working really hard my dream", "29:27", "is to become a world champion I'm", "29:29", "training three times a day I'm really", "29:31", "working I'm an engineer I'm trying to", "29:32", "build my skills out and then there's", "29:34", "other folks that come along like Steven", "29:36", "Seagal and so on that kind of talked", "29:39", "about other kinds of martial arts other", "29:42", "ideas of how you can do certain things", "29:44", "and I think I think Steven Seagal and", "29:48", "could is not mine beyond to something I", "29:51", "think we really need to be open-minded", "29:53", "like an ancient civilizing talks this", "29:56", "team or somebody talks to Steven Seagal", "29:58", "right the well Anderson Silva thinks", "30:03", "Steven Seagal is I would put this in a", "30:07", "respectful way he Anderson Silva has a", "30:10", "wonderful sense of humor and Anderson", "30:14", "Silva is very playful and he thought it", "30:17", "would be hilarious if people believed", "30:20", "that he was learning all of his martial", "30:22", "arts from got it he also loves Steven", "30:26", "Seagal movies legitimately so treated", "30:28", "him with a great deal of respect he also", "30:30", "recognizes that Steven Seagal actually", "30:33", "is a master of Aikido he really does", "30:36", "understand Aikido and was one of the", "30:38", "very first Westerners that was teaching", "30:41", "in Japan", "30:43", "speaks fluent Japanese was teaching at a", "30:46", "dojo in Japan and is you know a", "30:50", "legitimate master of Aikido right", "30:52", "the problem with Aikido is it's it's one", "30:57", "of those martial arts that has merit in", "31:01", "it in a vacuum they give you if you're",

it falls", "31:26", "horribly short let's see this is the", "31:29", "point I'm trying to make you just said", "31:30", "that we've investigated all the", "31:34", "intricacies you said all the intricacies", "31:36", "of hand-to-hand combat I mean you're", "31:38", "just speaking but you want to open your", "31:41", "mind to the possibility that Aikido has", "31:45", "some techniques in practice that are", "31:47", "effective yeah when I say all that's", "31:49", "your you're correct that's not a correct", "31:51", "way of describing it because there's", "31:53", "always new moves that are being like for", "31:56", "instance in this a recent fight between", "31:59", "Anthony Pettis and Tony Ferguson Tony", "32:02", "Ferguson actually used Wing Chun in a", "32:05", "fight he he trapped one of Anthony", "32:08", "Pettis Azur hands and hit him with the", "32:10", "elbow he basically used a technique that", "32:13", "you would use on a Wing Chun dummy and", "32:15", "he did it in an actual world class mixed", "32:19", "martial arts fight and I remember", "32:20", "watching it wow going this crazy", "32:22", "motherfucker actually pulled that off", "32:24", "because that's it's a technique that you", "32:26", "just rarely see anybody getting that", "32:29", "proficient at it that that fights in MMA", "32:32", "and Ferguson is it extremely creative", "32:35", "and open-minded guy and he figured out a", "32:37", "way to make that work you know world", "32:39", "class fight so and let me then ask you", "32:42", "the question there's there's these", "32:45", "people who still believe quite a lot of", "32:46", "them that there is this touch of death", "32:48", "mm-hmm right as soon as possible deep so", "32:51", "do you think it's possible to discover", "32:54", "through this rigorous scientific process", "32:56", "that is MMA that started pretty recently", "32:59", "do you think not the touch of death but", "33:01", "do you think we can get a 10x", "33:03", "improvement in the amount of power the", "33:04", "human body can can generate in and", "33:07", "punching no no certainly not 10x yeah I", "33:11", "think you can get incremental", "33:12", "improvements but it's all based entirely", "33:14", "on your frame like if you're a person", "33:16", "that has very small hands and narrow", "33:19", "shoulders you're kind of screwed there's", "33:21", "not really a lot of room for improvement", "33:22", "you can you can certainly get", "33:24", "incremental improvement and your ability", "33:27", "to generate power but you'll never be", "33:29", "able to generate the same kind of power", "33:31", "as say a guy with a very big frame like", "33:34", "brock lesnar or a Derek Lewis or you", "33:39", "know anyone who has there's like classic", "33:42", "elements that go with being able to", "33:45", "generate large amounts of power exactly", "33:48", "wide shoulders large hands there's a lot", "33:51", "of characteristics of the human frame", "33:53", "itself those even those people there's", "33:58", "only so much power you can generate and", "34:01", "we pretty much know how to do that", "34:02", "correctly so the the way you're talking", "34:06", "about as a martial arts expert now it's", "34:09", "kind of the way a lot of the experts in", "34:10", "robotics and AI talked about AI hmm and", "34:14", "one topic of touch of death is brought", "34:16", "up now the analogy is not perfect I tend", "34:19", "to use probably too many analogies as we", "34:23", "maybe know the human body better that we", "34:25", "know the possibility of a I would assume", "34:27", "so right yes the possibility of AI is", "34:29", "basically limitless once AR starts", "34:32", "redesigning itself it's not obvious that", "34:36", "that's true our imagination allows it to", "34:39", "be true when I am of two minds", "34:42", "I am I I'm both", "34:45", "I can hold both beliefs that are", "34:46", "contradictory in my mind one is that", "34:48", "idea is really far away almost bordering", "34:52", "on BS and the other is it can be there", "34:54", "overnight I think you could believe both", "34:56", "those things", "34:57", "so I'm hmm there's another quote from", "35:03", "Barbara wouldn't it's a poem I heard on", "35:07", "on the lecture somewhere that I really", "35:10", "like which is it's from the champions of", "35:12", "the impossible rather than the slaves of", "35:14", "the possible that evolution draws its", "35:16", "creative force so I see ayahuasca is a", "35:20", "representative of the champion of the", "35:22", "impossible", "35:22", "I see exponential growth of AI within", "35:27", "the next several decades as the", "35:28", "impossible but it's the champions of the", "35:31", "impossible that actually make the", "35:32", "impossible happen why would the", "35:35", "exponential growth of AI be impossible", "35:38", "because that seems inevitable to me so", "35:41", "it's not impossible I'm sort of using", "35:44", "the word impossible meaning magnificent", "35:47", "yeah it feels very difficult very very", "35:50", "difficult we don't even know where to", "35:52", "begin", "35:52", "Ram yep like the touch of death actually", "35:55", "feels I would see the touch of death is", "35:57", "horseshit but see urine looks like ha", "35:59", "and they touch you in the chest but we", "36:01", "don't have the ability in the body to", "36:04", "generate that kind of energy how do you", "36:05", "know that let's good question it's never", "36:09", "been done we understand you know it's", "36:11", "never physiology how do you know it's", "36:13", "never been done okay there could be", "36:15", "someone out there with magic that I that", "36:17", "has escaped my my grasp", "36:19", "no you studied you've talked about with", "36:20", "uh Graham Hancock you talked about the", "36:23", "history maybe was in Roman times there", "36:26", "was that idea was discovered and then it", "36:29", "was lost hmm because weapons are much", "36:32", "more effective ways of of delivering", "36:35", "damage now I find myself in a very", "36:37", "uncomfortable position of defending the", "36:39", "concept as a martial artist and defining", "36:42", "the concept of what martial arts did you", "36:44", "study", "36:45", "jiu-jitsu in judo and wrestling", "36:47", "wrestling those are the hard ones Jitsu", "36:51", "judo and wrestling those are absolute", "36:54", "martial arts in my opinion this is what", "36:56", "I mean like if you are a guy who just", "36:59", "has a fantastic physique and incredible", "37:02", "speed and ridiculous power just you just", "37:05", "can generate ridiculous power if you", "37:07", "just are just a pert you know who do you", "37:10", "know Deontay Wilder is yes Healy", "37:13", "champion the world boxer he's a fit you", "37:15", "have what's his name - whew Tyson Fury", "37:18", "on time tomorrow yes", "37:19", "guys yes Deontay Wilder has fantastic", "37:25", "power I mean he just knocks people", "37:27", "flying across the ring he's just", "37:29", "I think Deontay Wilder if he just came", "37:32", "off the street if he was 25 years old", "37:35", "and no one ever taught him how to box at", "37:36", "all and you just wrapped his hands up", "37:39", "and had him hit a bag he would be able", "37:41",

"38:07", "person who is let's say built like you", "38:11", "and a guy who exercises who's strong and", "38:15", "then there's someone who thank you", "38:16", "identically built like you who's a black", "38:20", "belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and you", "38:22", "don't have any experience in martial", "38:24", "arts at all you're fucked", "38:26", "right yes you're a person who's built", "38:29", "like you who's a guy who exercises and", "38:33", "is healthy and you grapple with the guy", "38:35", "who's even stronger than you and bigger", "38:37", "than you but he has no experience in", "38:39", "Brazilian jiu-jitsu he's still fucked", "38:41", "yeah that's the difference that's why I", "38:44", "think Brazilian jiu-jitsu and judo and", "38:46", "wrestling and particularly those are", "38:47", "absolutes in that you have control of", "38:50", "the body", "38:51", "yes and once you grab ahold of a", "38:53", "person's body there's no lucky triangle", "38:57", "chokes in

system mmm that requires", "62:33", "government to to play along seems like", "62:36", "that's going that way though right do", "62:38", "you feel like that one day we're gonna", "62:40", "have autonomous driving pretty much", "62:42", "everywhere especially in the highway", "62:45", "yeah it's not going there in terms of", "62:49", "its it's very slow moving so if", "62:51", "government does stop very slow moving", "62:53", "with infrastructure one of the biggest", "62:55", "things you can do for autonomous driving", "62:56", "will solve a lot of problems is to paint", "63:00", "lane

not really the desire for it to", "63:13", "but to explain to people what you mean", "63:15", "by that when the lanes are painted very", "63:18", "clearly the cameras and the autonomous", "63:20",

"63:40", "away but they don't give you the visual", "63:42", "texture information oh this is what", "63:45", "brand water-bottle they are", "63:47", "and cameras give you that information so", "63:49", "what Tesla is using the eight cameras I", "63:51", "think is they perceive the world with", "63:54", "with with cameras and those two things", "63:58", "require different things from the",

lane marking is a big one the", "64:19", "other there's there's a lot of", "64:20", "interesting infrastructure improvements", "64:23", "that can happen like traffic lights our", "64:25", "traffic lights are super dumb right now", "64:28", "they sense nothing about the world about", "64:31", "the density of pedestrians about the", "64:33", "approaching cars if if if traffic lights", "64:37",

"64:48", "can coordinate different things that in", "64:51", "terms of the same pedestrian kind of", "64:53", "problem well we have sensors now in", "64:54", "streets so when you pull up to certain", "64:56", "lights especially at night the light", "64:58", "will be red you pull up it", "64:59", "instantaneously turns green because it", "65:01", "recognizes that you've stepped over or", "65:03",

you want to have something like the", "65:15", "power of a smart phone inside every", "65:18", "traffic light it's pretty basic to do", "65:20", "but there is way outside of my expertise", "65:23",

"65:30", "of what we can do right now right and a", "65:33", "guy like Elon Musk or Sam Harris is", "65:35", "saying yeah but look at where technology", "65:40", "leads us if you go back to 1960 the kind", "65:43", "of computers that they use to do the", "65:45", "Apollo mission you got a whole room full", "65:48", "of computers that doesn't have nearly", "65:50", "the same power as the phone

80s and", "110:18", "the 90s", "110:19", "but it just died off that wood even", "110:21", "thought about it now it's come back to", "110:23", "the forefront when there's real AI or", "110:26", "real

hype in", "110:59", "the 80s and 90s I think it's ramped up", "111:01", "quite a bit what is the other one that", "111:03", "HD the oculus rift and what other one", "111:06", "just those to me those are the main ones", "111:07", "and there's other headsets that you can", "111:09", "work and use with yeah and there's some", "111:11", "you can use just with a Samsung phone", "111:13", "correct",
