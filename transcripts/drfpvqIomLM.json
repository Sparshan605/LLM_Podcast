out there and they sort of", "48:23", "alleviate themselves of any", "48:24", "responsibility because it's the robot", "48:25", "that's gonna go in there fuck things up", "48:27", "and also there's this ridiculous notion", "48:31", "that humans still seem to have that", "48:33", "these computers are never gonna become", "48:35", "autonomous of course yeah I mean at one", "48:38", "point in time every single programmer", "48:40", "that has ever made anything that you use", "48:44", "on your computer has had to contemplate", "48:46", "where the fuck that's going yeah where", "48:48", "the fuck the the anybody who's talking", "48:51", "about artificial intelligence anyone", "48:53", "who's talking about it they all say it's", "48:54", "gonna get to absenting point they all", "48:56", "say yes and it's almost like we don't", "48:57", "we're like little kids that have a", "48:59", "credit card and we're just gonna keep", "49:00", "running up the bill until the check", "49:02", "comes and then we're gonna go fuck how", "49:03", "do we pay this oh wait what have we done", "49:05", "oh shit we're fucked", "49:08", "yeah like we're gonna we're gonna create", "49:09", "this artificial thing that is way", "49:13", "fucking smarter than", "49:14", "and realizes how gross we are I think", "49:16", "it's not cheetah robot it goes up to 28", "49:18", "miles", "49:18", "look at that thing going oh my god", "49:22", "that's scary", "49:24", "that is fucking terrified it's so scary", "49:27", "look at it go man", "49:30", "but again 25 miles an hour running after", "49:32", "you imagine 200 of those running down a", "49:35", "hill it's not it's not just one they", "49:37", "just don't unleash one only swarm in", "49:40", "there they have they're covered in crab", "49:42", "like machetes gonna be like warmer it's", "49:44", "gonna be better slicer blades underneath", "49:47", "yeah they found out that cutting things", "49:49", "apart is like cheaper than shooting", "49:51", "missiles and guarantee they're gonna", "49:52", "have drugs that can figure out how to", "49:54", "turn human blood into energy it's just", "49:56", "it's just weird to me that you know that", "49:59", "this is all happening inside of our life", "50:01", "this is all going on right now I mean we", "50:03", "really are seeing robots that can run 25", "50:05", "miles an hour", "50:06", "well really are seeing drones to shoot", "50:07", "missiles it's like it seems like some", "50:10", "shit from a movie but it's really", "50:11", "happening right now and there really are", "50:13", "people that are programming computers", "50:16", "and programming artificial intelligence", "50:18", "and they really are going to get it to a", "50:20", "point where it can think for itself and", "50:21", "they really are going to get to a point", "50:23", "work and make its own decisions and", "50:24", "where it can decide to improve itself", "50:27", "Autobots", "50:29", "this is really happening in our life", "50:32", "like we really might be in this glory", "50:35", "day before the scene in a terminator I", "50:38", "mean that's like that's that it's within", "50:41", "the realm of possibility if no BOTS do", "50:44", "become sentient and then especially if", "50:46", "they need more power well that the", "50:48", "question is the type of singularity", "50:51", "that's not if the singularity is gonna", "50:53", "happen but the type of singularity that", "50:55", "happens and that the big question is and", "50:57", "advanced intelligence that we made", "50:59", "machines it becomes autonomous are they", "51:03", "going to view us as just a waste of time", "51:06", "and just decide to wipe us out or I", "51:09", "think that the other alternative is far", "51:12", "more likely are they going to see that", "51:14", "were a resource in the same way that", "51:16", "they would probably see everything as a", "51:18", "bit of information that they could use", "51:21", "to transform and create whatever the", "51:23", "thing is that they've decided is appart", "51:26", "more perfect", "51:26", "universe run so I think it's more likely", "51:28", "that they're gonna assimilate with us", "51:30", "than it is that they would just chop us", "51:32", "to bits because we are rudimentary bio", "51:35", "computers that certainly are gonna have", "51:37", "some use you know I think that I think", "51:40", "it's gonna be more about connectivity", "51:41", "than destroy well the real issue is how", "51:44", "do you program into an artificially", "51:47", "intelligent being the need to improve or", "51:49", "the desire to improve or the the need to", "51:53", "progress it's like just because", "51:55", "something is intelligent and capable of", "51:57", "incredible things and capable of", "51:59", "thinking on its own doesn't mean it's", "52:01", "gonna have those human style ambitions", "52:03", "that allow us or cause us to make like a", "52:07", "lot of the things that we make the", "52:08", "things that we make we make because of", "52:11", "this weird competitive drive that we", "52:13", "have because of this weird desire to", "52:17", "innovate and

know that a sentient computer", "52:29", "would have these characteristics like", "52:32", "these the characteristics that lead", "52:33", "people to work all day and bust their", "52:35", "ass and you know yes and acquire", "52:38", "material goods and be a baller and all", "52:40", "that stuff those are weird instincts but", "52:42", "what if those instincts inside of us are", "52:46", "not
