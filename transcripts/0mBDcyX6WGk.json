"09:44", "beautiful the weather was beautiful", "09:46", "there was one time where we had snuck up", "09:48", "to this one bull and he was younger he", "09:51", "was still a big bull but he was you want", "09:53", "to shoot ever yeah the ranch where we", "09:55", "were at they're really smart in how they", "09:58", "manage the wildlife there and one of the", "10:01", "things they do is you're you're supposed", "10:03", "to only kill an animal that's over eight", "10:05", "years old 8 years or older yeah so that", "10:07", "way they've had many many many years to", "10:10", "breed they're really like they're in the", "10:13", "later years of their life like how how", "10:15", "long does an elk live in the wild that", "10:17", "is lucky they thought that the bowl I", "10:19", "killed last year was 15 whoa but that's", "10:22", "rare that's crazy I mean a ten year old", "10:25", "bull was old yeah", "10:27", "so they figured at eight then it starts", "10:29", "going downhill so it's it's been past", "10:31", "its prime it's that's past this prime", "10:33", "and that's past this breeding prime so", "10:35", "that's when you want to take it out yeah", "10:37", "Colton said that mine was between eight", "10:39", "and a half and nine like he didn't", "10:41", "they're you know they're trying to get", "10:42", "specific yeah I guess they have to take", "10:44", "the jaw and yeah yeah teeth wear and", "10:47", "things like now so the estimate was", "10:49", "eight and a half to nine and a half", "10:50", "years that's an old bull it's an old", "10:52", "bull but yes Hank this uh so that", "10:55", "property it's about a quarter million", "10:57", "acres 250 thousand acres and they figure", "10:59", "there's almost three thousand elk you", "11:01", "know and that's actually a little bit", "11:04", "more than optimum carrying capacity for", "11:07", "that amount of property now many elk so", "11:10", "they'd like to get that number down a", "11:11", "little bit and it just increased the", "11:12", "habitat and the elk herd health but uh", "11:16", "do they ever think about capturing some", "11:18", "of those I know the Rocky Mountain Elk", "11:19", "Federation does that is it or Rocky", "11:22", "Mount foundation what is the foundation", "11:23", "yeah they they capture them and then", "11:26", "they'll release into places like", "11:27", "Kentucky and they've sort of", "11:28", "reestablished like a real herd there now", "11:31", "so for people for people that don't know", "11:33", "at one point in time elk were", "11:35", "essentially all over the United States", "11:38", "mm-hmm but then Europeans came and then", "11:40", "market hunting came and of course we had", "11:42", "rifles and it's not we we didn't do it I", "11:46", "was in there people people that are like", "11:48", "us out oh yeah but they the market", "11:52", "hunters essentially almost wiped out the", "11:55", "elk and at the turn of the century there", "11:57", "are very few alga deer and then they had", "12:00", "established some protocols and some", "12:03", "wildlife conservation ideas in place in", "12:06", "order to try to revive them they've done", "12:07", "an amazing job since then and now kind", "12:10", "of foundations like the Rocky Mountain", "12:12", "Elk Foundation what they've done is move", "12:14", "elk into areas where they had been", "12:16", "extirpated so they would they'd been", "12:19", "driven out of the area essentially a", "12:22", "stink extinct in this one particular", "12:23", "region and now they have healthy", "12:25", "populations they're hunting yeah I mean", "12:27", "they got enough to where they can manage", "12:28", "on Pennsylvania has a lot of help now", "12:30", "big bulls there yeah I've seen them on", "12:32", "on the internet a lot of ya know and", "12:35", "it's you know we talk about this every", "12:38", "time about hunters and conservation and", "12:40", "the Rocky Mountain out foundation but", "12:41", "those are the groups that that have", "12:44", "fought to protect Elk & elk habitat and", "12:46", "that's why they're doing so well but so", "12:48", "I think in fact here's a gratuitous", "12:51", "crotch shot can you see that oh that's a", "12:54", "Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation step step", "12:58", "back a little bit so people can see the", "12:59", "glory that is your belt buckle yeah so", "13:06", "that they've done an amazing job yeah", "13:08", "and then obviously there's companies", "13:10", "that have other foundations that have", "13:11", "done an amazing job for waterfowl", "13:13", "protecting wetlands", "13:15", "yeah and then for white tails I mean", "13:18", "there's more white-tailed deer in", "13:20", "America today than the war when Columbus", "13:21", "came that's what most people hunt is is", "13:24", "whitetail too because they're in eastern", "13:26", "southern US you know where elk are", "13:28", "mostly out west but they are you know", "13:31", "moving back east again but yeah most", "13:33", "most hunters are whitetail hunters and", "13:34", "those that animals doing amazing yeah I", "13:38", "mean so amazing so that

some states I kind of", "13:48", "wish I could I don't know every state in", "13:50", "the bag limits but I'm thinking Alabama", "13:53", "or somewhere down in there where we can", "13:55", "kill a deer a day as many as you want", "13:58", "there's no predators there's no winter", "14:00", "so that these animals aren't dying on", "14:02", "their own so I mean we just don't have", "14:05", "unlimited habitat because humans take up", "14:07", "space so down there the bag of limit is", "14:10", "a deer a day Wow and I don't know if", "14:12", "it's Alabama so don't don't quote me on", "14:13", "that but in one of those days yeah yeah", "14:15", "I think they have something like that", "14:17", "similar in some parts of Pennsylvania", "14:19", "New Jersey where they're in the

cooked", "31:08", "but what was really weird is the", "31:10", "difference in the connection with that", "31:12", "right like when you sit down and you", "31:14", "cook an elk steak you remember where you", "31:18", "were when you shot that you remember how", "31:21", "hard it was to get to that elk you", "31:23", "remember the stalk you remember maybe", "31:25", "made me several blown stalks where

I", "38:00", "shoot and I hit if you hit him in the", "38:05", "shoulder back then the bows weren't as", "38:08", "efficient as they are now but if you hit", "38:11", "him in the shoulder blade it

while", "38:30", "they take antlers and the guts and neck", "38:33", "and all the time so they heal up they're", "38:36", "amazing", "38:36", "so that was nothing essentially nothing", "38:39", "more than a flesh wound but I remember", "38:40", "sitting there looking at my arrow", "38:41", "looking at a little bit of blood on my", "38:43", "broad head and I mean eyes welling up", "38:48", "with tears because eight days just there", "38:51", "but working all year towards that moment", "38:54", "and having that opportunity at 43 yards", "38:57", "and being inches off because inches", "39:00",

that bad they don't see that but", "39:25", "that's why hunting is so powerful", "39:27", "that's why hunting has changed my life", "39:29", "because it's so difficult and because", "39:32", "there's those ups and downs and you know", "39:35", "we tried it we do a better job of", "39:37", "sharing a complete journey now then back", "39:40", "in the day you just you know just be", "39:41", "like a I killed this bowl that's it you", "39:43", "know you'd go to the archery Pro Shop", "39:45", "you put your picture up of the boulders", "39:47", "you kill them how is it now we're a", "39:49",

"39:57", "about you know providing for their", "39:58", "family and and pure protein in their", "40:01", "freezer so we we're doing a better job", "40:04", "of explaining it but still until you've", "40:05", "been there it's really hard to grasp", "40:08", "what it all means no I don't think", "40:11", "anybody's going to I don't think it's", "40:13", "possible it's it's also it's something", "40:16", "more it's a it's a discipline but it's", "40:19", "something more like sometimes people", "40:22", "call bowhunting a sport and I always", "40:23", "kind of cringe yeah I don't like that", "40:25", "either cuz I think is not a word for it", "40:27", "now I think there's a I don't think", "40:29", "there's a comparative word I think it's", "40:31", "bowhunting I think it is what it is", "40:33", "because I don't think the lifestyle is", "40:35", "what I say you have to be immersed in a", "40:37", "lifestyle to to really understand it a", "40:40", "sport makes us seem like you know", "40:43", "keeping score well it to me it's a lot", "40:45", "like jiu-jitsu in that way to where if", "40:48", "you talk to people who trained in", "40:49", "jiu-jitsu a lot they understand how", "40:52", "difficult it is and they understand the", "40:53", "struggle and they understand that in", "40:55", "that struggle like all struggles", "40:57", "everything I think people need struggle", "41:00", "I think it's very important yeah like", "41:02", "you you get better not just at the", "41:05", "jujitsu or not just at the bowhunting", "41:08", "you get better at being a person mm-hmm", "41:10", "and I feel better today after this trip", "41:13", "in Utah then I felt before I left", "41:16", "not that I felt bad before I left I felt", "41:18", "great but I feel energized what I feel", "41:21", "energized because the experience if", "41:22", "you're and you're energized because of", "41:24", "the struggle I feel energized because of", "41:26", "how difficult it was to hike those", "41:28", "mountains up and down and chasing those", "41:30", "elk around and and having things blow", "41:32", "out and getting back to the to the lodge", "41:34", "and being so tired that you could just", "41:36", "barely eat your food and then I'm", "41:38", "passing out almost like out of as I'm", "41:40", "done eating and then I crashed and the", "41:42", "alarm goes off at five o'clock in the", "41:44", "morning and then you're out there in the", "41:45", "dark doing it again yeah and then have", "41:47", "success so to understand that you can", "41:51", "push through things and you can get", "41:53", "better and you can practice things and", "41:56", "you can get better and that applies to", "41:57", "everything in life it does it's a", "41:59", "discipline but it's discipline like", "42:02", "almost no other because it's not just a", "42:05", "discipline it's a discipline that", "42:07", "also sustains you and your family and", "42:09", "it's a discipline that involves like", "42:11", "real critical moments of life and death", "42:14", "like when I was drawn back on that bowl", "42:17", "and I'm looking at this bowl through a", "42:19", "very small window where I could shoot", "42:21", "between these two trees 32 yards away", "42:24", "and Colton who was the guide paused this", "42:26", "bull he made a cow salad ma'am like", "42:29", "right where that bull needed to stop", "42:31", "like the bull walked in he cow called it", "42:34", "stopped and that critical moment will", "42:36", "you have to make a perfect shot in a", "42:38", "split second and intensity octane yeah", "42:42", "it's like nothing else yeah it's it's", "42:44", "and to do it mm-hmm and to do it", "42:47", "successfully and you have that he'll die", "42:49", "in seconds and have that he'll wander", "42:50", "off 20 yards like seeing you bleed out", "42:53", "of both sides knowing this is it and", "42:54", "this is probably no not probably", "42:57", "definitely unless he falls off a cliff", "42:59", "mm-hmm this is the cleanest fastest", "43:02", "death this thing is ever gonna have yeah", "43:04", "yeah no and then I'm gonna eat it", "43:08", "tonight yeah it's I know there's so much", "43:12", "reverence in the moment I what I like", "43:14", "and we talked about this film and and", "43:16", "and capturing and hopefully what the", "43:18", "message we can convey with the film but", "43:21", "you did a great job after that shot of", "43:25", "really just uh I guess verbalizing how", "43:30", "you felt in and and kind of everything", "43:31", "you just said but more authentic because", "43:35", "it it was you were right it was not real", "43:38", "and then the bull was laying there dead", "43:41", "and uh it's um I don't know it's intense", "43:47", "I wish are the way people could get it I", "43:48", "think these kind of conversations help a", "43:51", "little bit and I know for people", "43:53", "listening there's some people who go all",

"77:23", "know at least 20 reps per set what", "77:25", "you're doing lighter weights yeah you're", "77:27", "not trying to go to failure with heavy", "77:29", "weights go to trial you're with", "77:30", "everything if 20 doesn't get it then", "77:32", "I'll do 40 you know so it's but you know", "77:35", "you're not trying to go to failure with", "77:36", "like 3 or 5 for Ben what I'm talking", "77:39", "about and that's where people get hurt", "77:40", "no but so people need to find what works", "77:44", "for them basically I mean there's all", "77:46", "there's a lot of schools of thought on", "77:48", "like ok for the average person do this", "77:51", "right and that works for most people but", "77:53", "it's not gonna work for David Goggin", "77:55", "zorf right it depends

they're", "82:07", "eating the same thing like it should but", "82:08", "but his body for whatever reason doesn't", "82:11", "perform as well processing carbohydrates", "82:14", "as hers does I say and she stay in a", "82:16", "ketogenic date state and eat far more", "82:18", "carbs than he can okay I'm gonna let you", "82:21", "in on a little secret", "82:24", "oh I don't even know what the hell", "82:26", "ketogenic means I've heard keto this", "82:30", "keto Jay I'm like okay what is it okay", "82:33", "in a state of ketosis your body burns", "82:37", "off fat instead of carbohydrates and you", "82:40", "have to have an adaptation period where", "82:43", "your body goes from carbohydrates to", "82:46", "fats as a fuel source and your brain", "82:50", "uses ketones and your body uses ketones", "82:54", "for fuel instead of carbohydrates and", "82:56", "glucose is there an advantage yes and I", "82:59", "would suggest that anybody who's", "83:01", "interested in this go to my podcast with", "83:04", "Dom D'Agostino it was", "83:06", "four months ago maybe or Tim Ferriss", "83:10", "podcast with Dom D'Agostino is also an", "83:13", "excellent resource and there's", "83:16",

other day because", "83:49", "I was just like we lifted and I'm so", "83:51", "weak weak because I was running so much", "83:54", "right and so we did it we did a just a", "83:58", "few quick calculations and if you run a", "84:01", "marathon a day at my weight it was and", "84:05", "then just living because just living", "84:07", "you're gonna burn 1,700 calories a day", "84:08", "or me then plus the 3300 or something", "84:12", "that I'd burn when running a marathon so", "84:15", "it was like 5,000 calories and I was", "84:16", "eating three well so I was 2,000 deficit", "84:21", "that's too much yeah so he said I needed", "84:24", "to just ramped up the fats you know so", "84:27", "it started hammer nuts avocados things", "84:30", "like that and I actually did I was", "84:33", "feeling better we lift it again and I", "84:34", "felt better so yeah I think that's the", "84:36", "big part of the ketogenic diet that", "84:37", "people get wrong is a ketogenic diet is", "84:40", "primarily fats and then you have an", "84:43", "adequate amount of protein dependent", "84:45", "upon how much activity you do mm-hmm you", "84:47", "obviously do a lot of activity you would", "84:49", "need more protein than most and I think", "84:51", "you would also probably need more actual", "84:53", "carbohydrates than most yeah and still", "84:55", "stay in ketosis I think if that's", "84:57", "probably one of the reasons why you were", "84:58", "so tired and you felt weak but also I", "85:01", "think this thing that you're doing most", "85:03", "people are just not going to do no I'm", "85:05", "gonna burn three and eat two there's not", "85:08", "there's no blueprint for getting ready", "85:10", "for 200 mile race yeah so it's I'm", "85:13", "trying to figure it out

normally he'd be able to see me", "124:58", "but he where he bedded the tree was", "125:00", "blocking that so I used that tree and", "125:02", "uses the the cover of the wind to get in", "125:06", "close and that's on like you said a wild", "125:09", "animal that only cares about staying", "125:11", "alive essentially and for the bull brute", "125:13", "breeding but that is uh that was an", "125:17", "experience I got so close that I was", "125:19", "like okay if he he's gonna know I'm here", "125:22", "eventually what am I gonna get", "125:24", "what's he gonna do because their their",

"125:41", "full draw he's 10 feet away and he", "125:43", "stands up and he's like he knew right", "125:46", "then I'm standing plain as day what's he", "125:49", "stood up and we got an image I'll post", "125:51", "up here in a second of me at full draw", "125:54", "at 10 feet on this big bullet it's", "125:56", "incredible but the footage is amazing", "125:58", "that's gonna be cool to show now the", "126:00", "footage is gonna be amazing and we also", "126:01", "got footage of a bullet we couldn't", "126:04", "shoot because even though he's a huge", "126:06", "bull who was a younger bull who was", "126:08", "probably 5 or 6 years old and it was in", "126:11", "the snow and it was 40 yards away", "126:13", "broadside screaming his lungs out and", "126:15", "we're just standing

on public land like when I", "126:29", "used to hunt you know the cap wilderness", "126:32", "that Bulls dead oh yeah which that's I", "126:35", "I'm gonna try to kill that bull you've", "126:38", "gotten there's all sorts of things that", "126:39", "can happen you know when you're shooting", "126:40", "an arrow but uh the reason why we're", "126:43", "we're hunting is so good is because it's", "126:45", "so well managed because normally so it's", "126:48", "five or six years old that's a hell of a", "126:50", "trophy for anybody on public land but", "126:53", "when everybody could come together and", "126:55", "say okay guys here's what we're gonna do", "126:56", "we're only gonna kill the 8 to 10 year", "126:59", "old bulls", "127:00", "you let those bulls grow and then you", "127:02", "get an amazing that's that's one reason", "127:04", "why Arizona is so good they they do they", "127:08", "manage it for trophy animals and some", "127:11", "places in New Mexico New Mexico is good", "127:14", "there's a place in Oregon it's the", "127:17", "winner ha that's where I put in for in", "127:19", "its public land but it's a really hard", "127:21", "tag drive but put it in for for 17 years", "127:23", "now but they only give they they were", "127:27", "given ten I think now they give twenty", "127:28", "tags a year and there's big bulls there", "127:31", "and it's just because it's managed so", "127:33", "there's a few different places that are", "127:34", "managed for older animals but if you're", "127:36", "just going straight up public land", "127:38", "it's really hard to pass up a five or", "127:40", "six-year-old bowl now how do they make", "127:41", "that decision to only give 20 tax", "127:43", "because it's probably I would imagine", "127:44", "thousands of people that are trying to", "127:46", "draw yeah these tags and only 20 people", "127:48", "get an opportunity yeah how do they make", "127:51", "that distinction just by the biologists", "127:53", "pick the number of animals yeah just do", "127:56", "some sort of a survey and find out how", "127:57", "many of their animals are on and also", "128:00", "some places managed for better genetics", "128:02", "and higher potential of what they would", "128:04", "call there's a real problem with that", "128:06", "word trophy because people think oh you", "128:08", "just want to decorate your wall that", "128:09", "animal's body whether you know are you", "128:11", "trophy hunter or do you eat the meat I'm", "128:13", "like both yeah well this is an intense", "128:17", "experience with amateur animal that has", "128:21", "a lot of it's a lot of lifetime of", "128:24", "surviving yeah like it's a way different", "128:27", "animal like if when you're around a", "128:29", "young bull they don't know anything", "128:30", "they're like babies well they know it", "128:33", "spike they barely know what's going on", "128:35", "like who are you my spikes been alive", "128:36", "for a year and a half right so that's", "128:39", "where the herd protects them elk are", "128:41", "herd animals they look out for each", "128:42", "other so when you have an eight to 10", "128:46", "year old bull that has a protection of", "128:48", "the herd but also has has been around", "128:52", "for eight to ten hunting seasons that's", "128:54", "a smart animal he's seen some shit he's", "128:56", "seen some stuff and it's a smart animal", "128:58", "so there's a guy in camp also that has", "129:01", "hunted San Carlos Indian Reservation and", "129:06", "he talked about this big bolt there that", "129:09", "new is being hunted circled around them", "129:11", "came in from the back side of the", "129:13", "hunters to look at him because he was", "129:16", "that that bull had been around and knew", "129:18", "what was going on so much and so they", "129:21", "were able to track him and see what he", "129:22", "did and he went around behind the", "129:24", "hunters and so these animals imagine I", "129:29", "mean this is where they live every day", "129:31", "you know for eight to ten years you see", "129:34", "some stuff you learn where humans as", "129:37", "hunters like to go you know I saw we are", "129:40", "probably a minor threat in comparison to", "129:43", "the mountain lions yeah yeah we're", "129:45", "talking about how many cats are on this", "129:46", "ranch right there's there's life but", "129:49", "they know humans are danger", "129:52", "I mean they know that and like I said", "129:53", "they know so so there's certain places", "129:56", "where hunters regardless of who's there", "129:59", "go to glass go to call and those elk", "130:03", "know that okay I see something there", "130:06", "that's where I've seen a humor whatever", "130:09", "they think a human is before I'm not", "130:12", "going there right you know so it's uh", "130:14", "once you get an age on an animal it gets", "130:17", "tough it's tough to get him killed and I", "130:20", "would imagine the mountain lion", "130:22", "population as high as it is like they", "130:24", "have to be on point 24/7 with something", "130:27", "that's faster than them mm-hmm", "130:28", "killed it kills them with its teeth yeah", "130:31", "something that can leap up and literally", "130:33", "grab a hold of its neck remember we were", "130:34", "talking to Johnny in Colorado and he was", "130:36", "telling us about the footprints that he", "130:38", "found they found a bunch of cat", "130:40", "footprints and then they found a bunch", "130:41", "elk footprints and then they only found", "130:44", "the elk footprints and a couple hundred", "130:46", "yards later I found a dead bull with a", "130:49", "giant mountain lion clinging to its neck", "130:51", "uh-huh like that's a hard life when a", "130:54", "fucking hundred and fifty pound cat", "130:56", "bring down a thousand-pound bull yeah so", "130:59", "that said the lion was on the bull's", "131:01", "back yeah so that's why it's it's if", "131:04", "some prints were gone in the snow", "131:06", "because he was up on the bull trying to", "131:08", "get it killed the bull was taken off for", "131:10", "a couple hundred yards finally that cat", "131:12", "clamped down on probably its windpipe", "131:14", "got it killed and that's happening", "131:17", "outside of season that's not I mean", "131:20", "every day every day", "131:21", "that's not read that's not hunting", "131:23", "season that's that's just real life out", "131:25", "there so airs yeah yeah so it's but we", "131:30", "kind of you started to talk about the", "131:31", "trophy hunting aspect you know what", "131:33", "people you know when they have that that", "131:36", "trophy hunting moniker that is it has", "131:38", "negative connotation and that's what we", "131:41", "talked about this a little bit last", "131:42", "night on the way back from the airport", "131:44", "the grizzly hunting in British Columbia", "131:47", "you know yeah that they're stopping that", "131:50", "November there'll be no more grizzly", "131:52", "hunting they were killing 250 bears a", "131:55", "year out of 15,000 so they're basically", "131:58", "just managing the population you know", "132:00", "you have to take a certain amount of", "132:02", "animals out given the habitat carrying", "132:03", "capacity to land especially predator", "132:06", "because they don't have predators right", "132:07", "right because what else is gonna kill a", "132:09", "grizzly right nothing nothing so people", "132:12", "say well the you know they'll their", "132:14", "numbers will drop down on their own if", "132:16", "they're they eat all the deer and all", "132:18", "the moose you're right", "132:19", "their numbers will drop down but it will", "132:21", "take decades yeah and if you're in that", "132:24", "time you're gonna destroy two different", "132:26", "things right you're gonna destroy the", "132:28", "ungulates they're gonna get devastated", "132:30", "yeah and you're gonna also destroy the", "132:33", "economy that comes with hunting mm-hmm", "132:35", "like the economy that comes with hunting", "132:37", "those ungulates because they're gonna", "132:38", "get devastated by the overwhelming", "132:39", "population of grizzly bears and the", "132:42", "economy that comes with hunting the", "132:43", "grizzly bears right in managing them", "132:46", "what they're gonna have to probably do", "132:48", "is what they've done with mountain lions", "132:49", "in California what people don't know", "132:51", "because mountain lion hunting is", "132:52", "outlawed in California so what they do", "132:54", "is they hire hunters to kill mountain", "132:56", "lions and they've killed", "132:57", "I believe they killed almost a hundred", "132:59", "last year I think it was like 97 most of", "133:02", "them they find pets in their body they", "133:05", "find like their primary food source more", "133:07", "than 50 percent of dogs right and they", "133:09", "just killing people's dogs so the Lions", "133:11", "are still getting killed yeah but", "133:13", "they're just not hunters doing it it's", "133:14", "government basically shoot they can run", "133:18", "dogs with them they can do all sorts of", "133:19", "things to get them killed but it's a", "133:21", "government paying somebody to do it as", "133:23", "opposed to hunters paying for the", "133:25", "opportunity to do it to kill the same", "133:27", "amount so instead of money going to the", "133:29", "state the state's paying money and it's", "133:31", "a lot of money especially when you're", "133:33", "talking about something like grizzly", "133:34", "bears well a grizzly bear what they're", "133:36", "saying up there and I I you know did", "133:38", "some research on it just because I want", "133:39", "to know how this works because why I got", "133:42", "why is being stopped it's just public", "133:44", "outcry and the new government in British", "133:47", "Columbia said in this day and age you", "133:50", "know the public just can't stomach", "133:52", "grizzly trophy honey so the public what", "133:55", "the hell does the public know the public", "133:56", "doesn't even they're not even out there", "133:58", "well they have a misconception and their", "134:01", "their idea is all based on them being in", "134:04", "these cities and the major population", "134:07", "center of British Columbia is Vancouver", "134:09", "right that's a big urban whatever", "134:11", "liberal yeah a lot of different people", "134:13", "there on camera you don't have to be", "134:15", "generalizing the fine probably if they", "134:17", "could have voted for Obama they would", "134:19", "so these people that live in Vancouver", "134:23", "they comprise the majority of the people", "134:27", "that are voting in British Columbia they", "134:29", "voted out the grizzly bear honey but", "134:31", "these people like that I know like my", "134:33", "friend Mike cockroach who lives in BC", "134:35", "yeah Mike's had a lot of experience with", "134:37", "grizzly bears and wolves wolves up there", "134:40", "are so plentiful they don't have a bag", "134:42", "limit on them you can shoot as many", "134:44", "wolves as you want they encourage you to", "134:46", "shoot wolves there's even a bounty in", "134:48", "some places on wolves well and do you", "134:50", "know it's so-so", "134:52", "I think this was a little different up", "134:54", "there with the Bears I don't think they", "134:56", "voted it out per se I think the new", "134:58", "government came in they took a poll and", "135:02", "said who you know supports grizzly honey", "135:05", "or whatever 71 or 74 percent said they", "135:07", "were opposed so the new government just", "135:10", "said okay we're gonna make the decision", "135:13", "to stop it", "135:13", "well they didn't stop it this is what", "135:15", "they did you can hunt the Grizzlies for", "135:17", "meat but you can't keep the rug or the", "135:21", "skull or the skull the height or the", "135:23", "school which we people consider trophies", "135:25", "right what the problem with that is that", "135:26", "is also a resource you're eliminating a", "135:30", "resource if you shoot a bear and you eat", "135:32", "the bear why wouldn't you keep the rug", "135:35", "like have a bear rug in your house to", "135:37", "commemorate that experience yeah and", "135:39", "also it's you know people have bearskin", "135:42", "rugs it's it's always been I have about", "135:45", "50 of them but it's it's something that", "135:48", "people you know like if you're eating", "135:50", "the animal that is also a part of the", "135:53", "animal why would you be compelled to", "135:54", "throw that away yeah it seems incredibly", "135:57", "wasteful no it's disrespectful right", "135:59", "it's also disrespectful to just
