good", "40:43", "that's not good but when it comes to", "40:45", "like federal land the problem is if", "40:47", "these states get into debt and this is", "40:48", "what people need to understand they can", "40:50", "sell it off yeah so that if Utah is in", "40:53", "debt let's just i'm just not picking on", "40:55", "utah but if they just for some reason", "40:56", "they wind up in debt which states do all", "40:58", "the time and then they sell off a giant", "41:02", "chunk of land to some oil company now", "41:05", "you can't camp there anymore you can and", "41:07", "by the way that's

Mormons", "41:48", "let me I'll take the first point you", "41:50", "take that so Senator Mike Lee comes out", "41:54", "and says right this is like the perfect", "41:56", "the perfect way to spend this type of", "41:58", "thing he starts he calls back to in", "42:02", "senator Orrin Hatch from Utah has also", "42:04", "done this call back to like the", "42:06", "sagebrush rebellion and things like that", "42:08", "calling back this it's the saying that", "42:10", "wilderness is akin to the European", "42:14", "aristocracy", "42:15", "because only a certain few can go there", "42:18",

to", "42:45", "try to convince you well they're still", "42:47", "for you", "42:48", "he's right in a certain way what he's", "42:50", "right in is that if you put roads", "42:52", "through anybody could go through anytime", "42:54", "they wanted on a car if they had no legs", "42:57", "no can barely walk if they are in a", "43:00", "wheelchair normally but they can drive a", "43:01", "car yeah they can go in deep into the", "43:03", "woods and they can enjoy all of the", "43:06", "wilderness they surely can't stop that", "43:07", "is true however it's not like there's a", "43:12", "lot of places that they can't also go to", "43:15", "they can go a lot of places where they", "43:17", "can do that you can go to Yellowstone", "43:18", "yes", "43:19", "damn gorgeous you just drive through", "43:21", "that and you see all the trees and the", "43:22", "animals and Yellowstone is a wonderful", "43:24", "proxy for going outside yeah it's an", "43:26", "introduction to what it is without", "43:27", "really being in it yeah it's like a zoo", "43:30", "that's free-range yeah is exactly what", "43:33", "it is I live right I live an hour from", "43:35", "there and I've taken my family there and", "43:36", "it just feels like I used to feel like", "43:38", "oh man this is an illicit place as", "43:40", "somebody who's gone into the wilderness", "43:41", "and and tackle these big challenges and", "43:44", "hiked around in crazy places this", "43:47", "Yellowstone is like it makes me feel", "43:48", "uncomfortable then I somebody said to me", "43:51", "like it was this guy named Cody rich who", "43:53", "has a podcast called the rich outdoors", "43:55", "he said to me it's like it's like it's", "43:57", "I'm an ambassador for real wilderness", "43:59", "hmm it's like a way to present", "44:01", "to people that this thing exists without", "44:04", "them having to actually strap on the", "44:06", "pack get some trekking poles and hike", "44:08", "miles up into the the wilderness this is", "44:11", "part of the problem whenever you're", "44:13", "talking about the wilderness is so few", "44:16", "people go to it yeah it's like if we", "44:18", "were talking about the surface of Mars", "44:20", "with the people to create the rover well", "44:22", "you know how the surface Mars is it gums", "44:24", "up the wheels it's red Stefan's red how", "44:26", "many people are going to Mars how many", "44:28", "people are really going to the", "44:29", "wilderness yeah not that many there's", "44:32", "more people going to the wilderness than", "44:34", "Mars but I've always said like the the", "44:36", "public lands movement and I am", "44:39", "definitely part of it I feel like I", "44:41", "could probably represent the money's", "44:43", "things better but like I i'm definitely", "44:45", "part of it it's it's scary and a little", "44:47", "in a lot of ways because people can say", "44:49", "like keep it public man keep it public", "44:50", "that's like apple pie and bald eagles", "44:52", "and freedom it's an idea that we all pay", "44:56", "into a thing we all own anybody right", "44:58", "can go there it's super easy to get on", "45:01", "that train mm-hmm it is real easy to get", "45:04", "on that train and lose your critical", "45:05", "thought around what what is the idea of", "45:08", "wilderness I mean because when I think", "45:11", "of my hunting now like we first went", "45:13", "hunting like five or six years ago you", "45:14", "would ask me this question I would given", "45:15", "you a whole different what would you", "45:17", "said then I don't know what I would have", "45:19", "said there but not this answer I might", "45:20", "have said like were you a fairly", "45:22", "youngish man I'm only going I'm green", "45:24", "even 3133 oh you beautiful person yeah", "45:27", "look at you oh I love you the perfect", "45:29", "complexion look at you is if all your", "45:31", "cells are firing correctly no liver", "45:33", "spots yet this whiskey's really it's not", "45:36", "by Irish so what do you think you would", "45:40", "have called it then so what I probably", "45:42", "would have said like when we first went", "45:44", "hunting and BC together from moose what", "45:47", "I probably would have said would have", "45:49", "been around it would have been less", "45:50", "value-based and more like I'd do it", "45:52", "because my dad did it I'd do it because", "45:54", "it connects me to to my dad like my dad", "45:57", "my family my people I do it because", "45:59", "humanity did it we talked we filmed a", "46:01", "video remember sitting on the thing we", "46:03", "talked a lot about our humanity right", "46:05", "like the drawling back through the", "46:06", "history of time when the hunter was", "46:10", "exalted in a tribe of people was the", "46:13", "only way to get me it's the only way to", "46:15", "get meat so", "46:15", "your skills that you acquired as a", "46:17", "hunter made you important to the culture", "46:20", "the society the everyday life I would", "46:24", "have probably called back to that not", "46:25", "that I would say that's wrong now but", "46:27", "what I've come to find out over some", "46:29", "other years of hunting in a lot of", "46:31", "places is that I think my hunting is", "46:32", "more about healthy ecosystems now than", "46:35", "it is about anything else I think all my", "46:41", "efforts should be around clean water", "46:43", "clean air places that we can go and", "46:46", "explore and what that brings to our", "46:49", "world that brings more wildlife that", "46:51", "brings places for my son to go and", "46:53", "experience these things and so I've", "46:56", "changed over there's a very short time", "46:57", "and the way that I do it well the more", "47:01", "you experience the wilderness and then", "47:03", "go back to the city and then go back to", "47:04", "the wilderness the more you realize how", "47:05", "special it is out there and the more you", "47:08", "realize when like today I went flying in", "47:11", "a helicopter over LA with me good friend", "47:14", "bill burr and as he was taking me up I", "47:16", "was looking at all this development we", "47:18", "were talking about all these apartment", "47:19", "complexes they're being developed and", "47:21", "he's like yeah he goes you really see it", "47:23", "when you're up here in the air because", "47:25", "you see where there was nothing and then", "47:26", "like a couple weeks later it'll be flat", "47:28", "now and then a couple weeks later they", "47:29", "start construction you realize like oh", "47:31", "this is how it spreads and that this is", "47:33", "just something that people do and if you", "47:35", "don't put a put a line you know draw a", "47:38", "line we're gonna keep going we're gonna", "47:40", "make our way across the country and I've", "47:41", "heard that argument from people that", "47:43", "don't go to the wilderness like look how", "47:45", "much of the you know we don't", "47:46", "overpopulated look how much of the", "47:48", "United States has no one living in it", "47:49", "fly over and look down at all the places", "47:52", "that don't have cities and don't have", "47:54", "roads and don't have houses like yeah", "47:55", "yeah yeah for now none of this shit was", "47:59", "here 200 years ago that's what we", "48:00", "ploughed we plowed ground to plant the", "48:04", "corn so you could have the things you", "48:05", "have well fly over in 1819 yeah you know", "48:09", "fly over a hundred two hundred years ago", "48:11", "bitch there was nothing here yeah it was", "48:13", "zero I don't know with Wilbur Wright", "48:15", "yeah and Orville come on see what you", "48:17", "saw but yeah if you get just go 300", "48:18", "years you have nothing", "48:19", "you have zero things yeah well that's I", "48:22", "think there's some perspective and I", "48:23", "think a honey has a lot going for it", "48:25", "around the fact that has urbanization", "48:27", "happens you know as job", "48:30", "being for me like as jobs become more", "48:32", "prevalent in urban places and people", "48:34", "have to travel from wherever they're", "48:35", "growing up to these urban places and", "48:37", "live so removed from wilderness so", "48:40", "removed from sustainability I think for", "48:45", "a long time because hunting peaked in", "48:46", "1982 there was like seventeen point five", "48:48", "million hunters around that year because", "48:51", "of Ronald Reagan yeah as president I'd", "48:56", "listen I'm I wasn't even alive so let's", "48:59", "not I don't know but like post-world War", "49:04", "two there was a rise in the modern", "49:06", "hunter or mountain sport hunter happy to", "49:07", "describe it there's that there's this", "49:10", "rise in nineteen eighty two and then a", "49:11", "precipitous fall right from there until", "49:14", "2016 there's around 11 million hunters", "49:17", "in this country it's just like drop it's", "49:20", "a big drop and in I will always say that", "49:22", "like the three things that I think", "49:24", "happened or urbanization so people are", "49:28", "getting removed from they're getting", "49:30", "moved away from having hunting in their", "49:32", "lives on a daily basis not that they're", "49:34", "anti hunting in any way they're just", "49:35", "getting removed from from that thing", "49:38", "than getting your meat on your own they", "49:40", "removed from that a lot of times you", "49:41", "remove

that it's a", "73:10", "it's very difficult to get into this", "73:13", "area you have to have a certain amount", "73:14", "of points which means you're putting in", "73:17", "to the pool of money

a tag in", "75:34", "that nature you have a tag you can then", "75:35", "choose to do anything you want with it", "75:37", "in legal bounce you sure you didn't", "75:39", "wound this animal so you could let that", "75:40", "animal pass and choose a larger more", "75:43", "mature more impressive down and you let", "75:45", "nature take its course whether a", "75:47", "predation or not in the

you", "76:53", "know behave like and I and I said this", "76:56", "and Randy kind of we talked through it", "76:58", "but I said that that this is a unique", "77:00", "situation to a hunter if you're a hiker", "77:02", "and you come across an animal wounded in", "77:05", "this way", "77:05", "injured in this way there's very little", "77:07", "you can do yeah but this is unique to", "77:10", "the

what", "93:10", "people people get really crazy they'll", "93:13", "get really crazy when you kill predators", "93:15", "right even if you're gonna eat them like", "93:18", "I was looking at Adam

that's fair that's so", "95:15", "unfair we talk for well can we talk for", "95:17", "a minute about baiting bears yes", "95:20", "well that's can we want to keep", "95:21", "legitimate purpose let's keep right", "95:24", "being I read if you want to keep that", "95:25", "down for the light is that was oh just", "95:27", "put it back up when you will get to it", "95:29", "there's a Redis I've read

I agree with that", "96:24", "in comparison to other ways of hunting", "96:26", "right but at the same time I could say I", "96:27", "can tell you this there's no more", "96:30", "ethical if the idea

around caring for the single animal", "106:11", "every caring for the entire species of", "106:12", "that animal or in case subspecies of it", "106:15", "yeah like that that's me something I've",

as I'm", "106:24", "thinking about this and in I I really", "106:28", "would love to build a bridge with people", "106:30", "to say I care like if you're in let's", "106:33", "say you're an anti

was a", "166:39", "non-viable male and they made it out", "166:41", "like it was this rare giraffe but it's", "166:43", "rare because it's old it was dark", "166:45", "because the darkest ones are

people but in his", "168:07", "defense the stereotypical hunter that is", "168:10", "in his mind what he's fighting against", "168:13", "yeah he's an asshole yeah yeah and I", "168:15", "would agree and I would be like dude I", "168:16", "agree with you most hunters agree with", "168:18", "you something that guy wants to fly to", "168:20", "Africa and shoot an elephant and is not", "168:22", "even gonna eat it yeah and he just wants", "168:24", "it because he's getting the Big Eight", "168:26", "yeah well there's a lot of weird shit", "168:28", "yeah the problem the problem I have with", "168:29", "that is like the specifically calling", "168:31", "out that single person or smaller group", "168:34", "subset of hunters that you don't agree", "168:36", "with to paint the entire group like that", "168:39", "they think that that's the only way they", "168:41", "can get people to stop yeah they think", "168:43", "that what they've done with Cecil look", "168:45", "they're they enacted real change yeah", "168:47", "there's been real change around a lot of", "168:48", "this stuff yeah with Cecil they enacted", "168:51", "real change but unfortunately a lot of", "168:52", "it has been negative what people don't", "168:54", "understand is how much it costs the", "168:57", "people that live there and about these", "168:59", "hunting concessions get closed down and", "169:01", "then these animals go wild and then what", "169:03", "happens is poachers just take over and a", "169:06", "lot of the animals get decimated the", "169:07", "same way they did in the United States", "169:09", "before market hunting was out well they", "169:11", "you look at what it what a concession is", "169:13", "right a concession and this happened I", "169:15", "want to say happening like the late 70s", "169:16", "and early 80s in Africa where there was", "169:18", "you know at especially antelope and", "169:20", "African antelope and all these other", "169:22", "species that were there they were they", "169:23", "were not at the brink of extinction but", "169:25", "they were suffering okay a concession is", "169:28", "essentially a bunch of rant landowners", "169:29", "get together and let's put a fence", "169:30", "around our stuff to keep everything keep", "169:33", "poachers out and keep the animals in", "169:35", "once you know in Africa wins especially", "169:37", "South Africa when concessions became", "169:40", "prevalent wildlife populations", "169:42", "skyrocketed you know triple-double times", "169:45", "ten hundreds of thousands of Anil Abed", "169:47", "were there before fortunately because", "169:49", "that's the only way they could have", "169:51", "values yeah value because they have", "169:53", "monetary value yeah and I don't know I'm", "169:55", "conflicted about that me too yeah I'm", "169:58", "conflicted about it it's like a thing", "169:59", "that worked but is that the way I don't", "170:02", "I don't know I've been over there I'll", "170:04", "probably never go back over there", "170:06", "because there's just so many things in", "170:08", "this North America I'd like to pursue", "170:10", "but like it's something I was involved", "170:13", "like I went and did and I realized hey", "170:15", "look", "170:16", "this is way too complicated and and if", "170:19", "there's too much weight too much", "170:20", "American influence based on the money we", "170:22", "bring you over there that isn't rooted", "170:25", "in exactly what's good for Africa right", "170:27", "so I I think like African hunting is", "170:31", "valuable it's like you can paint that", "170:32", "picture all day long they can be like", "170:35", "this is it's valuable it's about for", "170:36", "these reasons and nobody can not really", "170:38", "argue like the end result of the thing", "170:40", "but will it argue to argue the end", "170:42", "result because it's been so much more", "170:44", "effective than just conservation based", "170:46", "on donations yeah and that's what people", "170:48", "don't understand that argue against it", "170:50", "you're wrong when it comes to the", "170:52", "numbers the numbers you're wrong it's", "170:54", "right you would like to think that", "170:55", "people hunting zebras don't help but", "170:58", "they do yeah that's what they help way", "171:00", "more than people to go over to take", "171:01", "photographs yeah so so am I willing to", "171:04", "say like get rid of that so I can feel", "171:05", "better about hunting no fuck no because", "171:07", "I want there to be more animals the", "171:10", "number is so different in the amount of", "171:12", "money they contribute this is where", "171:13", "people have to understand because", "171:14", "they'll throw some numbers at you like", "171:16", "you know five thousand people go to", "171:19", "safaris only two thousand people huh", "171:20", "yeah sure but the two thousand people", "171:23", "that hunt they hunt and they spend way", "171:25", "more fucking money it costs a lot of", "171:28", "money to shoot a lion looks like fifty", "171:30", "thousand dollars as much as you find", "171:32", "lion hunting distasteful you have to", "171:34", "understand that if you remove it it's", "171:37", "like when you take a dictator out yeah", "171:39", "and then you have like a power vacuum", "171:40", "how do you replace it well it's just", "171:44", "like they're they're just some like on", "171:46", "the ground things that happen to around", "171:48", "look if you want to do wildlife viewing", "171:50", "you got to cut roads like yeah you got", "171:53", "to put if you want to do wildlife", "171:54", "viewing people are gonna pay less so", "171:56", "means you have to have more people", "171:57", "encouraging them on these places where", "171:59", "these wild animals are you have to make", "172:02", "parks where humans can't go and you have", "172:05", "to be prepared when humans get attacked", "172:06", "by anti yeah I'm just gonna fucking", "172:08", "happen and so it's it's never as simple", "172:10", "as it seems it is as simple as it seems", "172:12", "to say like the numbers say that that", "172:14", "African trophy hunting is benefiting the", "172:16", "wildlife now is it benefiting in the way", "172:18", "that everybody thinks is best", "172:19", "that's debatable but you can't you can't", "172:23", "sit here and say like if we end this", "172:25", "today they'll be more gay maybe like", "172:26", "it's probably the reverse is that", "172:28", "probably the reverse it might it'll hurt", "172:31", "your feelings but it's the reverse yeah", "172:33", "what's going on right now in Africa with", "172:35", "what would the exact area that Cecil the", "172:37", "lion happened in is that they had a call", "172:40", "200 lions they had to shoot 200 Lions", "172:44", "which means they had to pay someone to", "172:45", "go and shoot these lions because they're", "172:47", "their population gotten so high they", "172:50", "were decimating the undulate population", "172:51", "so all the Antelope and all the", "172:53", "different animals that the Lions were", "172:55", "hunting they were destroying them yeah", "172:57", "because they have to eat a lot man", "172:58", "but you're a 600 pound cat and all you", "173:00", "care you're a you're a meat processor on", "173:02", "four legs brow like there's no you can", "173:05", "be like hey listen man", "173:06", "listen just lay off for a couple of", "173:08", "weeks listen I know they're delicious I", "173:13", "know you really like to eat also you", "173:16", "know there they were just breeding", "173:18", "unchecked yeah and then their", "173:20", "populations quickly got to very", "173:24", "unmanageable no well it seems it sucks", "173:26", "it's never as simple as it seems the", "173:29", "mountain lions in California Washington", "173:32", "and Oregon like this year in Oregon and", "173:34", "Washington two people were killed one in", "173:36", "each state that hasn't happened in a", "173:38", "hundred years you know I've talked to a", "173:40", "lot of people that say that's an anomaly", "173:41", "but it happened nonetheless it doesn't", "173:45", "mean anything simple if it's an anomaly", "173:46", "it's also a reality is it yet those are", "173:49", "predators yeah and they're big and", "173:51", "they're they've killed I think 55 bears", "173:53", "in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem", "173:54", "this year just probably that number I", "173:57", "could be skewed in some way for me but I", "173:59", "think that's what I heard and that they", "174:01", "V a lot of black bears right that invade", "174:03", "I think this is this was all grizzly", "174:07", "bears

amount", "174:30", "of mountain lions and the way they", "174:32", "killed them is they have to hire people", "174:33", "and have to use public funds these tax", "174:35", "dollars and they hire a guy
