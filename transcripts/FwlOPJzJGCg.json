tutelage", "44:15", "of Matt Hume he became the Mighty Mouse", "44:17", "we see now but in my opinion one of the", "44:19", "things that sets him apart from", "44:20", "everybody else is that he he's not", "44:23", "running away from you and not getting", "44:26", "hit he's running at you and not getting", "44:29", "hit I mean he's coming straight forward", "44:31", "and then cutting angles and

plan and strategy it's funny", "46:52", "you say that was to let him come to you", "46:53", "like everybody when because Patrick was", "46:55", "the type of fighter that was a go-getter", "46:57", "he had that big overhand right you know", "46:59", "he would he would put change yeah he", "47:01", "would put pressure on you and I said", "47:02", "Patrick I'm telling you you can't fight", "47:03",
