and I couldn't figure out how", "28:04", "so I looked it up on YouTube and so I", "28:07", "had like a forty second clip sent to me", "28:08", "and I'm like you know about this riots", "28:10", "and I wanted to show it somebody and so", "28:12", "I go and I find it on YouTube and I", "28:14", "watch it and it's the same thing in the", "28:15", "40 seconds and it ends but the video", "28:17", "that

it or I mean is", "69:07", "this written anywhere", "69:09", "oh yeah the anti-fog books are crazy", "69:10", "they talk about collection of capital", "69:13", "the the you know any kind of racist

or", "85:23", "something like you can just go like fire", "85:26", "everybody who knows what they're doing", "85:27", "and replace some of the people who don't", "85:28", "know what they're doing and want to be", "85:29", "just diversity like I'm going to say", "85:31", "they're not competent but they do want", "85:33", "to focus on diversity or whatever the", "85:35", "issue of the day is so

like sight more black scholars", "86:44", "and women's scholars and indigenous", "86:46", "scholars and so you don't cite white", "86:47", "people or men so you can even out their", "86:50", "citation

have to hire identities you", "87:01", "have to hire people who think that way", "87:02", "because otherwise they don't qualify and", "87:04", "then you start getting rid of the people", "87:08", "who don't think that way so you're", "87:11", "actually concentrating even in like I", "87:12", "mean somebody just sent me something", "87:14", "about chemistry", "87:15", "the field of chemistry is like going", "87:17", "like full loke and it's like what the", "87:19", "hell does that have to do with chemistry", "87:21", "how can chemistry go woke chemistry is", "87:23", "so I mean that is like one of the more", "87:26", "solid disciplines you really you'll", "87:28", "hardly believe it but the truth is that", "87:30", "they the the woke theory actually", "87:33", "believes this it actually

"87:56", "read an article I'm a mathematician and", "87:58", "I read an article recently about how", "88:00", "that has to happen in math so math we", "88:02", "have to get away from it says the idea", "88:04", "that math is objective that it tells you", "88:07", "something objective about the world we", "88:08", "have to start opening our minds up to", "88:10", "other types of mathematics

similar that's", "88:21", "by a Chinese scholar 10 on or on 10 I", "88:27", "get it backwards sometimes that came out", "88:29", "in January or something that was saying", "88:31", "the same thing

was input into the Seattle", "88:41", "schools and you can look that up on", "88:42", "Seattle's like government education", "88:45", "website and they're like we need to", "88:46", "question we need

really", "135:07", "means so imagine like you and I go out", "135:10", "for a walk", "135:11", "down the sidewalk right and for whatever", "135:13", "reason you step on you know the back end", "135:16", "of a broken bottle and you trip and you", "135:18", "bump into me and you knock me into the", "135:21", "road when you trip and I happen to hit", "135:23", "by a car and I die okay so whose fault", "135:26", "was that", "135:27", "obviously usually we'd probably say he's", "135:29", "like no fault or whatever but if you", "135:31", "start looking at it the way that these", "135:32", "scholars do and this is actually", "135:34", "tracking the same argument that's in the", "135:35", "book being white being good by Barbara", "135:38", "Applebaum about white complicity what", "135:40", "happens is you could say well you it's", "135:43", "your fault for tripping and it's my", "135:44", "fault for deciding to walk on the street", "135:46", "side versus the the inside and walking", "135:48", "right next to you instead of slightly in", "135:50", "front of you it's a person who drove the", "135:51", "cars fault for you know maybe they were", "135:53", "speeding maybe maybe they happen to have", "135:56", "chose to go at that time maybe the", "135:57", "doctor called and they had to run out of", "135:59", "the house so the doctors now got some", "136:01", "complicity and in this situation the kid", "136:04", "who broke the bottle last night after he", "136:06", "had a couple of beers well it's his", "136:08", "fault", "136:08", "so he's complicit but then if you go all", "136:11", "the way to this systemic understanding", "136:12", "where you're just looking at the back", "136:14", "end the wallpaper over the hole in the", "136:16", "wall it would be saying well we live in", "136:18", "a culture where people drive cars and", "136:21", "drink beer we live in a culture that", "136:23", "supports cars and beer everybody that", "136:26", "supports

"getting hit by that car and so you can", "136:47", "see it makes it impossible to figure out", "136:48", "where moral responsibility actually lies", "136:51", "because it puts it on everybody and it", "136:53", "makes it impossible to see what the", "136:54", "actual causes are another story I had", "136:57", "from similar to this was from University", "137:00", "of Michigan there's this program called", "137:01", "stride and it's supposed to fix for", "137:04", "these disparities so I'm talking to", "137:05", "somebody and he's talking about hiring", "137:07", "academic hiring and he says okay the way", "137:10", "the stride paper the stride program", "137:12", "looks at it for whatever reason men have", "137:14", "twice as many of this as women whatever", "137:15", "the thing is", "137:16", "and so stride says okay so if a woman", "137:18", "applies you count the number if a man", "137:21", "and a woman apply you count the number", "137:22", "the man has you double the number of", "137:24", "women", "137:24", "and I said hang on a second wait a", "137:25", "minute do you know why that number is", "137:29", "different", "137:29", "he said no nobody knows why it's", "137:32", "different it just is so we're just gonna", "137:33", "double and I said but some of that might", "137:34", "be discrimination and some of it might", "137:36", "not and I would agree with you that we", "137:37", "should consider making up for the part", "137:39", "that is discrimination so maybe it's", "137:41", "half of that is discrimination so you", "137:42", "add of something that you don't double", "137:44", "it because some of it might be something", "137:45", "different and you don't know and he was", "137:47", "like well what else could it be", "137:49", "right so this systemic thinking prevents", "137:52", "you from being able to start thinking of", "137:54", "what the real causes the real problems", "137:56", "are so it's again it's fixing your hole", "137:58",

something", "138:51", "like anti racism or diversity or", "138:54", "inclusion or equity and they don't tell", "138:55", "you really what it means it just sounds", "138:57", "good right and so that's why I'm writing", "138:59", "that encyclopedia my opinion you know I", "139:02", "am a firm believer that people should be", "139:05", "able to believe what they want they", "139:06", "should be able
