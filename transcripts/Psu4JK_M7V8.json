with", "31:34", "like would you even be able to see it", "31:36", "yet because you know the human brain", "31:37", "hasn't seen it yet oh no it was it's my", "31:41", "theory about about how we believe that", "31:45", "everything around us is everything that", "31:46", "there is right and I talked about farts", "31:49", "and when I say is that if someone farted", "31:51", "and you didn't have a nose you'd have no", "31:53", "idea something was go I don't know I'm", "31:55", "talking about something you used to say", "31:56", "a while ago something like kind of you", "31:58", "were kind of saying like how cuz are", "32:00", "would you even be able to see it because", "32:04", "our brain has been seen it yet like the", "32:06", "tiger or the tiger bit was if a tiger", "32:10",

know", "34:19", "we call it a sense or a feeling that", "34:21", "might be real energy that you're", "34:23", "detecting we're just not evolved enough", "34:26", "to the point where we can really tune", "34:28", "into it yet why is it that we like our", "34:32", "own smell your own farts but not", "34:33", "somebody else as far as my farts are", "34:35", "delicious do you think it's just like I", "34:36", "don't know do you think we would enjoy", "34:38", "if we made her say like you know like if", "34:41", "you forced yourself yeah no my first and", "34:43", "enjoy like make yourself into
