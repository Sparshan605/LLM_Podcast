you could be sentenced to", "05:34", "a murder you could get a murder sentence", "05:37", "too", "05:38", "because of that so there was about a", "05:40", "dozen of those and none of them happened", "05:43", "all at once so if you committed perjury", "05:45", "during a murder trial you could be", "05:46", "sentenced for murder for the same amount", "05:48", "of time that someone would get

"essentially what I'm getting so far I", "06:36", "haven't finished a book but what I'm", "06:37", "getting so far is there was some sort of", "06:40", "a CIA program where they were explain", "06:45", "how they did it they they infiltrated", "06:48", "these hippie communities and they", "06:51", "allowed Charles Manson over and over and", "06:53", "over again to get out of jail they knew", "06:56", "that he was committing all these crimes", "06:57", "and instead of incorporating careful", "07:00", "when we say they who's they", "07:02", "yeah we have to kind of break it all", "07:03", "down let's let's break it all down one", "07:05", "of the other things I found out that was", "07:07", "very significant was that Manson had a", "07:09", "parole officer his first parole officer", "07:12", "who kind of had given him a", "07:14", "get-out-of-jail-free card for the first", "07:16", "year after Manson was released in prison", "07:19", "and it was miss Rogers Matthew yeah and", "07:21", "he was a criminologist in the Bay Area", "07:25", "Manson violated his parole the day that", "07:28", "he was released in Los Angeles and this", "07:29", "is one of the you think it's a little", "07:31", "lie but it's an important lie that Vince", "07:33", "Puleo see presented not just in at trial", "07:36", "but also in his book a trial it's much", "07:38", "more serious", "07:39", "he changed the narrative he said Manson", "07:43", "had been given permission to travel to", "07:45", "San Francisco from LA when Manson was", "07:47", "paroled Manson hadn't been given that", "07:49", "permission he just showed up there they", "07:51", "originally were gonna violate him set", "07:53", "him right back to prison and someone", "07:56", "stepped in and took care of that and let", "08:00", "Manson stay in San Francisco and he was", "08:02", "assigned to Roger Smith it took about a", "08:05", "year and a half but through a Freedom of", "08:07", "Information Act process I got his", "08:09", "federal parole file and those were the", "08:11", "kind of seeds of how I found out that", "08:13", "Manson had this immunity from", "08:15", "prosecution for the two years he was out", "08:18", "of prison from 67 until the murders", "08:20", "occurred in the summer of 69 hoo hoo I'm", "08:22", "sorry to interrupt but who was Smith", "08:24", "doing this for who was giving him the", "08:27", "instructions to continue to let Manson", "08:29", "out and he can in to continue to", "08:31", "moderate well that's the problem I", "08:32", "didn't get the whole file and the file I", "08:34", "got had redactions he would report to", "08:37", "the head office and they would give him", "08:39", "instructions and then he would violate", "08:41", "those instructions and there'd be no", "08:43", "repercussions for him", "08:45", "or for Manson for instance Manson was", "08:48", "arrested in July of 1967 three or four", "08:54", "months after he got out of prison when", "08:55", "he was under Roger Smith supervision for", "08:58", "interfering with an officer who was", "09:01", "trying to arrest one of his first young", "09:03", "followers Ruthie amaura house who was 15", "09:05", "and he was put in jail pled out so he", "09:10", "got a three-day sentence a new probation", "09:13", "sentence as well and all that was hidden", "09:16", "like it's not in Bulli o'seas book the", "09:19", "the parole officer Roger Smith a week", "09:22", "later wrote to the head office that", "09:24", "Manson was doing fine and he actually", "09:26", "recommended that Manson be allowed to go", "09:29", "to Mexico and work in Mexico and the", "09:31", "head parole office in the United States", "09:33", "since his federal wrote back and they", "09:35", "said that's insane he was supposed the", "09:37", "job that he was going to do in Mexico", "09:39", "was surveying soil for insect", "09:42", "insecticides I mean had nothing to do", "09:44", "with and I have all these documents", "09:46", "showing this who was hiring him Charles", "09:48", "Manson to serve a soil it was a company", "09:52", "and Nevada which disappeared a couple", "09:55", "years later it was a bullshit company I", "09:58", "believe so yeah how do you think they", "09:59", "were doing down there I see that's it I", "10:02", "don't like to speculate I can't prove it", "10:03", "all I know is just the fact that his", "10:06", "parole officer asked to send him not", "10:07", "only to Mexico but to the country that", "10:10", "Manson had been deported from in 1959", "10:13", "the last time he was a free man he had", "10:16", "violated his parole then he was arrested", "10:19", "in Mexico right he was arrested in", "10:20", "Mexico and brought over by the federales", "10:23", "and given over to federal custody for I", "10:27", "was a drug violation and some other", "10:29", "stuff so why would his parole officer", "10:31", "send him back to this place three months", "10:35", "after he'd been released and how do you", "10:37", "supervise somebody who's in another", "10:38", "country can I make a summary just for", "10:41", "people who like what the fuck is going", "10:43", "on right now essentially what you're", "10:45", "saying is that Charles Manson was a part", "10:48", "of some sort of a program yes and that", "10:51", "through this program they were using him", "10:56", "and using with LSD and all the members", "11:00", "of the family they were turning them", "11:03", "violent and why why do you think they", "11:06", "were doing this again this is where I", "11:07", "got a real it in a little I have to be", "11:10", "real careful about not saying anything", "11:12", "that I haven't been able to prove", "11:13", "understand what I proven is that he was", "11:16", "getting leniency from the federal", "11:19", "government and the law enforcement first", "11:23", "in San Francisco that year the person", "11:26", "who represented the federal government",

you know things really kind of", "16:37", "shook the course of my reporting was I", "16:41", "learned that West had been at the same", "16:43", "place that Manson was in the Haight in", "16:45", "the

wasn't a", "17:16", "lot of I mean I guess there was a lot of", "17:18", "Google then or a little bit but when I", "17:19", "did a little research I found out that", "17:21", "there have been these allegations that", "17:23", "he'd been involved in MKULTRA he always", "17:25", "denied it he was never prosecuted never", "17:28", "even investigated he went to his grave", "17:29", "threatening to

I", "17:49", "went through them through the whole", "17:50", "summer looking for a needle in a", "17:52", "haystack", "17:53", "and it was intuition gut I just thought", "17:56", "there might be something there", "17:57", "and sure enough I eventually found it it", "17:59", "was correspondence between jolly West", "18:02", "and Sidney Gottlieb the doctor that ran", "18:04", "MKULTRA beginning

it", "66:10", "didn't make sense you're right and", "66:11", "that's why I think well I think if we", "66:13", "get away with anything then because the", "66:15", "antics of the family at the trial

thoughts was that it had to do with", "95:35", "some sort of CIA operation to overthrow", "95:40", "Castro yeah well there was so the Warren", "95:43", "Commission concluded that Oswald acted",

of books about that", "97:41", "yeah and in their findings and then", "97:44", "later the to the head of the committee", "97:46", "uh Robert Blakely wrote a book where he", "97:49", "said that that

know interaction with Ruby prior to", "98:18", "Ruby committing the murder couldn't find", "98:21", "that and that's the kind of thing that", "98:22", "maybe there's no evidence maybe it", "98:25",

would you do that well the first", "98:53", "report which was fabricated by his first", "98:57", "lawyer who admitted this years and years", "98:58", "later he told Ruby to say he did it to", "99:01",

here what are you doing to me", "99:32", "don't you know who I am because he knew", "99:33", "all the cops my argument in my book is", "99:38", "it's important my most important finding", "99:41", "is that a CIA contracted agent or", "99:45", "researcher for mind control became the", "99:49", "most important witness to the Warren", "99:51", "Commission he became that witness's", "99:54", "doctor right before he testified and", "99:57", "told his story ago that should have been", "99:59", "disclosed obviously to the Commission", "100:01", "but they're not gonna say because it's a", "100:03",

"101:06", "Specter will look at them and then", "101:07", "decide if he'll talk to you fax him to", "101:09", "us and at that point that was 2002 I'd", "101:12", "lost the magazine story and I didn't", "101:14", "have a book deal so I wasn't operating", "101:16", "entirely on", "101:17", "I said I can't send this stuff to you", "101:19", "because it's my smoking gun the letters", "101:22",

only supposed to talk for a", "101:41", "few minutes and when I explained what I", "101:43", "had and what it showed West had you know", "101:45", "been involved with at the time he", "101:47",

Specter had", "102:29", "been a long-term senator he was running", "102:32", "for re-election and it was the first", "102:33", "time in his career but the polls were", "102:36", "against him that his

more people", "102:47", "knew him for the Kennedy assassination", "102:48", "than anything else I thought so if I do", "102:51", "meet with him and I show him these", "102:52", "documents maybe it was grandiose of me", "102:54", "to I thought he's gonna go oh my god I", "102:56", "need to be part of their you know", "102:59", "exposure because if he didn't and walked", "103:03", "away from it I thought they were", "103:04", "important enough that he would know that", "103:07", "that would you know once they were", "103:09", "publicized and he had the opportunity to", "103:11", "say hey we need to look into this and", "103:12", "didn't he would look bad so then I", "103:14", "thought well maybe he's gonna two things", "103:16", "he's either gonna use it for to get", "103:19", "publicity have a press conference and", "103:21", "help him in his reelection or he's going", "103:24", "to use it to be the hero of it", "103:27", "and run with it before I published a", "103:29", "book and then I'll just be a footnote", "103:31", "you know to all this because he took it", "103:33", "so I cancelled the meeting the morning", "103:35", "up I called up his press secretary and", "103:40",

"103:48", "to Los Angeles I actually was scheduled", "103:50", "to go the day after on Sunday so it was", "103:53", "a lie and I didn't talk to anyone I just", "103:55", "left the message and I said I'm so sorry", "103:57", "but I obviously I've worked so hard to", "103:59", "get this meaning it's embarrassing but I", "104:02", "have to go back so I left my parents", "104:05", "place to go to the post office cuz I had", "104:08", "been there for three months I was", "104:10", "actually writing the first version of", "104:11", "the proposal at their place to get away", "104:13", "from my friends and you know all the", "104:15", "distractions in LA and I was only gone", "104:18", "for like 15 minutes I go mama if that", "104:20", "press secretary calls I told them I was", "104:23",

"104:33", "home 15 minutes later and she's like as", "104:36", "white as a ghost I go what she goes", "104:39", "senator Specter called I go see me in", "104:41", "the press secretary because no he called", "104:43", "himself he wanted to know what happened", "104:45", "why you changed your mind and why you", "104:46", "were cancelling and I had to lie Don I", "104:48", "don't lie I go but I lied to the senator", "104:51", "and you know he was a big deal in", "104:52", "Pennsylvania back then and so I don't", "104:56", "know if that was a mistake on my part I", "104:58", "think you know 20/20 hindsight I should", "105:00", "have done it and taken my chances I did", "105:03", "close what would have done I know that's", "105:06", "a very powerful man and if he thought", "105:09", "that he was in danger yeah I could have", "105:11", "fucking driven off a cliff I never I", "105:14", "mean I really didn't try to think like", "105:16", "that through all those years I thought", "105:17", "like that when it comes to Arlen Specter", "105:20", "I mean do you know how deep that guy had", "105:22", "to be in on that to come up with that", "105:24", "whack I imagine without fear he's so bad", "105:28", "the fact that that actually gets debated", "105:30", "and the fact that never gets brought up", "105:32", "that there were more bullet fragments in", "105:34", "Connolly's body than there were missing", "105:36", "from that bullet yeah and the fact that", "105:38", "anyone who knows anything", "105:40", "about guns right any anyone who's ever", "105:42", "shot a gun is seen with a bullet with a", "105:44", "bullet shatters bone and what it looks", "105:46", "like would look at that fucking bullet", "105:47", "and think that bullet went through two", "105:49", "human beings right right and the fact", "105:51", "that the reason why they had to make up", "105:53", "this theory in the first place was", "105:55", "because a guy was hit by a ricochet on", "105:57", "the underpass yeah I know the whole", "105:59", "story behind that well here's what I did", "106:01", "I tried not to lose myself any more than", "106:04", "I had to", "106:05", "in each compartmentalized area I was", "106:09", "going into so with the Kennedy", "106:10", "assassination I just did a superficial", "106:13", "cause like Manson I was never interested", "106:15", "in any thing so-called conspiracies yeah", "106:18", "I never cared about Kennedy or the John", "106:21", "F Kennedy assassination but once I found", "106:23", "out that West was connected to Ruby and", "106:25", "again that was a moment that I was like", "106:27", "oh no I mean first it was West in the", "106:29", "CIA and then I'm like and Ruby how can I", "106:31", "not look at the Kennedy assassination so", "106:34", "I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby", "106:37", "Oswald West Specter I looked a little", "106:40", "bit of the Magic Bullet and agree with", "106:42", "you but I never did a deep dive and a", "106:44", "lot of that stuff well they had to come", "106:46", "up with that theory because there was a", "106:48", "guy who was hid under the underpass", "106:50", "mm-hmm he was hit by a Friday no bullet", "106:53", "hit the curb and it the piece of the", "106:56", "curb hit him so he had been injured they", "106:59", "recovered that bullet and they realized", "107:00", "that that had been a shot that had hit", "107:02", "that area and so then they had to", "107:05", "attribute all of those wounds to one", "107:08", "bullet right so they had different", "107:11", "bullets they had the bullet that was the", "107:12", "head shot they had the bullet that hit", "107:14", "the curb and then all the other injuries", "107:16", "had to be attributed to one bullet yeah", "107:18", "not only that there's a different", "107:20", "description of the frontal shot there's", "107:23", "a shot when Kennedy you see Kennedy", "107:25", "grabbing his neck right well in the", "107:27", "hospital in
