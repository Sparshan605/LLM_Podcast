really should but you'd have to", "82:35", "change so much you'd have to change so", "82:37", "much in the way people there's so many", "82:39", "different factors the way the practice", "82:41", "out there they set up plays yeah it", "82:43", "would have to be a new game I don't", "82:44", "think it's gonna happen", "82:45", "I think the perception of the helmet", "82:47", "being safer fucked the game up I really", "82:50", "think did but you know alright I used to", "82:52", "think that bare-knuckle boxing like they", "82:56", "should have bare knuckles in the UFC but", "82:57", "then I've been watching this", "82:58", "bare-knuckle boxing stuff and people get", "83:00", "cut up so bad mm-hmm now I'm thinking", "83:03", "you know what it's better to have padded", "83:05", "knuckles it's better yeah it's better", "83:07", "for the fighters well that helmets were", "83:09", "padded they just weren't like a hard", "83:11", "shell mm-hmm shell is what they did you", "83:14", "know you used it as a weapon so that's", "83:16", "literally the only way you're gonna be", "83:17", "able to stop some of the", "83:19", "brain damage yeah and you're still not", "83:20", "gonna be able stop

yeah and", "83:48", "then the practices will be different", "83:50", "where we only do pads once a week love", "83:54", "it for the real game will be amazing if", "83:56", "they ever came up with something that", "83:58", "definitively fixed it like some", "84:01", "stem-cell treatment or something like", "84:02", "that that regenerated brain tissue and", "84:04", "bring you back to your normal state", "84:05", "right if they do that then we now have", "84:07", "to worry about anymore right", "84:08", "but until that man oh that's gotta be", "84:10", "around the corner that's close I
