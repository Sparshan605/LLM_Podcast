okay", "00:37", "I've thought about it a million times", "00:40", "I'm sure how long ago was this this was", "00:42", "so that would have been early October or", "00:45", "mid October so you guys are three months", "00:47", "three months to come around yeah and", "00:51", "yeah man it's just one of those things", "00:53", "that I've thought about it so many times", "00:57", "in my head and I've always been I think", "00:58", "Steve was the same way like I'd be", "01:00", "pretty cool to survive a bear attack get", "01:04", "scratched up a little bit after that", "01:06", "experience I

like what are the odds that that", "01:29", "happens yeah I think that in order to", "01:32", "get that you have to go through a really", "01:33", "really horrible experience there's guys", "01:35",

yeah and you don't", "02:16", "even think about I just remember it was", "02:20", "it was a weird situation", "02:21", "so all maybe I'll just kind of recap", "02:22", "this story so we're we're on afognak", "02:26", "island and we're hunting in the fog nook", "02:29", "island is yeah so a fog neck island has", "02:33", "some of the largest bears in the world", "02:34", "they're brown bears

before and it's just a", "02:49", "miserable place to be what's a", "02:51", "fascinating hunt the way you guys were", "02:52", "describing it because the just the fact", "02:55", "that you would choose out of all the", "02:57", "places you can go you pretty much can go", "02:58", "anywhere you want yeah you chose to go", "03:01", "on this brutal adventure hunt because", "03:04", "it's so difficult and says once", "03:06", "is it like vanilla was talking about", "03:08", "this once and the way he described it is", "03:10", "like there's things that are fun while", "03:12", "you're doing them but they're not fun", "03:14", "later like roller coasters yeah and then", "03:16", "there's things that are terrible and", "03:19", "awful but you'll think about them", "03:21", "forever and look back at them fondly", "03:22", "yeah that's exactly what this is it's", "03:24", "that after the fact you think back and", "03:27", "you go in the moment you go I will never", "03:30", "do this again", "03:31", "and then about a year later you I should", "03:33", "do that again and what is it about the", "03:36", "place that's so miserable well it's just", "03:38", "it's hard to walk through it looks it", "03:41", "looks easy hiking and there's just this", "03:43", "big mountain where you can get to you", "03:45", "with a plane you've kind of got to climb", "03:46", "this big mountain and the vegetation is", "03:49", "so thick and it's so steep that it takes", "03:52", "forever to go somewhere so to put it in", "03:55", "perspective to go say a mile might take", "03:57", "five hours whoa that's how much vertical", "04:00", "it like a map mile yes so the way the", "04:03", "crow would fly if you just go in a mile", "04:04", "and then another distance could take you", "04:07", "half that time or a quarter of that time", "04:09", "but there's a big mountain in between", "04:11", "where you need to go plus the vegetation", "04:15", "and it's really steep so you've got all", "04:18", "that kind of working against you plus", "04:19", "you can't really walk in just a straight", "04:21", "line there you've got to navigate around", "04:22", "all kinds of stuff there's you", "04:25", "from the place I'm in this Jamie that", "04:28", "was so that was after the bear right", "04:38", "after yeah I'll have to figure out", "04:39", "because I right after the bear attacked", "04:42", "I pulled out my phone and just kind of", "04:44", "like recording everyone's reactions and", "04:46", "then I put it on my Instagram story but", "04:49", "I'll I'll try to find it tonight", "04:50", "and I'll post it on to some I'll figure", "04:52", "out a way to yeah interesting together", "04:55", "they let you save them now now this was", "04:58", "like three weeks before that", "04:59", "unfortunately", "05:00", "so this place is miserable it's rainy", "05:04", "all the time rainy high winds thick", "05:07", "thick dense vegetation and literal", "05:10", "monsters yeah I mean giant bears and", "05:12", "then big the elk are probably was they", "05:18", "way they wait they can wait up to 1,400", "05:20", "pounds easy way bigger yeah it's like", "05:22", "the size of two normal way twice because", "05:25", "like an average elk would probably be", "05:27", "around five hundred pounds in most", "05:29", "places in a really big one like we're", "05:32", "talking about the California ones it to", "05:33", "hone sometimes can get to a thousand", "05:35", "yeah this is another four hundred pounds", "05:37", "exactly it's a lot that's a biggie shine", "05:39", "and there's bears that eat those giant", "05:42", "and also those bears are giant the Bears", "05:44", "can be over 1,200 1,500 pounds of sauce", "05:47", "eleven feet or more uh yeah eleven feet", "05:52", "eleven feet it's nuts", "05:54", "eleven foot bear no this one that", "05:58", "attacks you guys how big do you think it", "05:59", "was if you had to guess I would say well", "06:01", "I would say it's eleven and a half feet", "06:04", "because I know because actually after we", "06:08", "went in there my friend", "06:09", "who's a pilot there and dropped us off", "06:11", "he called me about a week or two later", "06:14", "he's like they shot that bear they went", "06:16", "after you guys somebody went in there", "06:18", "same place bear attacked him they killed", "06:22", "it in self-defense it was 11 and a half", "06:25", "feet and I think almost 1,200 pounds oh", "06:28", "so there's very good odds that that was", "06:31", "the same bear I would imagine that it", "06:33", "was there's very I mean see Mary had", "06:36", "taken over that area", "06:38", "seemed about the same sup when I when it", "06:40", "came in I thought that's a big bore it", "06:42", "wasn't one of those ones you think oh", "06:43", "that's a it looked like a big mature", "06:46", "animal in there piecing together what", "06:50", "happened in my mind later but yeah so", "06:53", "we're hunting elk on this island", "06:56", "Stephens up getting an L we hang it in a", "07:00", "tree we do all the stuff you're supposed", "07:01", "to do get the meat away from the carcass", "07:03", "but we had yet to see a bear up until", "07:06", "this point and when my brother and I", "07:08", "went in there a few years earlier we", "07:10", "just saw bears every day we'd see six", "07:11", "bears a day so your minds just bear bear", "07:14", "bear when you're seeing them all the", "07:15", "time you're not seeing them all the time", "07:17", "you get a little lacks and that's where", "07:19", "we really screwed up because the attack", "07:23", "went down no one was prepared we were", "07:26", "just sitting around having some", "07:28", "sandwiches and one uh so we're at we're", "07:31", "filming and there's six of us all", "07:33", "together and I think that large group", "07:35", "that six is what saved us because when", "07:38", "the bear ran in it was six of us sitting", "07:41", "kind of in like a semicircle a strange", "07:43", "circle and when that bear came in we did", "07:46", "that scatter effect and I think that", "07:50", "scatter was kind of like if a Lions", "07:52", "going after a zebra they use their", "07:54", "numbers and stripes to confuse the lion", "07:56", "is that scattering of things just going", "07:59", "everywhere that caused confusion for the", "08:02", "bear so I think the bear went in", "08:04", "thinking whatever is under that tree I'm", "08:06", "gonna kill it and it thought it was one", "08:07", "thing and when we blew up into six", "08:09", "different pieces it just tried to kill", "08:12", "everything at once and couldn't actually", "08:13", "get one person God but it's so lucky", "08:17", "yeah it was crazy because we're sitting", "08:19", "down we decided we'll have lunch before", "08:23", "we hike back because the day before we", "08:24", "we hiked a long ways we got back to camp", "08:27", "it three in the morning or something I", "08:30", "can't remember two or three in the", "08:31", "morning we'd barely eaten so everyone", "08:34", "was just thinking let's have lunch", "08:36", "regroup hike out so we're Pat when the", "08:41", "other guys that was with us brought the", "08:43", "Jetboil to boil up some coffee so I was", "08:47", "going around collecting water from", "08:48", "everyone to get coffee go", "08:50", "around and when I sat down I took my", "08:52", "pack off and I'd the whole week I'd been", "08:54", "doing this thing where I take my pistol", "08:55", "from the pack belt and put it on the", "08:58", "holster on my body when I dropped my", "09:00", "pack and I it was that weird deal where", "09:03", "I took the pack off and I'm thinking", "09:05", "about switching and like it's fine you", "09:07", "know and I thought I'll just sit because", "09:09", "there's few times I'd set my pack down I", "09:11", "was like I'll just sit I'll lay on my", "09:13", "pack like as a chair a backrest and then", "09:15", "I'll flop the you know have the pistol", "09:18", "right there so it's within arm's reach", "09:19", "and I'll be sitting there well I go", "09:21", "around get the water and then someone", "09:22", "had moved kind of where I was sitting so", "09:23", "now so I sit down across from the pack", "09:26", "where my pistol is and then thinking and", "09:32", "I was thinking about how hey hand me", "09:33", "that pistol but I just like you know you", "09:35", "don't wanna be that guy like oh yeah the", "09:37", "guy's not everybody had pistols just me", "09:42", "and Jana said a pistol and then and then", "09:46", "Pat's behind us he goes I hear something", "09:47", "and I look up and that's that bears like", "09:50", "dead set so Steve would be where you are", "09:52", "the bear behind Steve so like Steve was", "09:56", "between me and the bear his back was to", "09:57", "it like how far away not far I don't", "10:00", "know 30 yards so the first time you see", "10:03", "the 30 yards and is it for nerds yeah", "10:05", "it's dead run Oh super fast I just", "10:08", "locked eyes with this thing I mean I see", "10:10", "it coming in the hallway just beady eyes", "10:13", "locked in on me and I think this thing's", "10:16", "gonna kill me and so I'm thinking you", "10:18", "know when I say I'm thinking I don't", "10:20", "know if I'm thinking I'm just I just", "10:23", "remembered what I what was kind of going", "10:26", "through my head at the time I thought oh", "10:27", "fuck I'm gonna die and my protections", "10:31", "right there like I'm gonna die this is", "10:32", "that sense situation where I'm dead and", "10:35", "they talked about it and he could have", "10:37", "saved himself but his guns on the ground", "10:38", "and I think that that was like go for", "10:40", "the gun was my whole thing so I start to", "10:43", "go for the gun Yanis would have been", "10:45", "here as I remember it and so I start to", "10:48", "go for the gun and realize fuck I don't", "10:49", "have time to get to my gun and it's", "10:50", "three feet away that bear is like right", "10:54", "there come so fast so fast so I kind of", "10:56", "do like a football Juke move left right", "10:59", "and then wheel around right do like a", "11:02", "spin with my back and the start", "11:03", "running to the left and at that point", "11:06", "Yanis it I didn't know this at the time", "11:09", "because I looked at some pictures after", "11:11", "it's kind of piece everything together", "11:12", "so Yanis was sitting right next to me I", "11:14", "think he got up to turn there was some", "11:16", "trekking poles right here he grabbed the", "11:18", "trekking pole so probably while I was", "11:20", "juking he reached around grabbed the", "11:22", "trekking pole swings around hits the", "11:24", "bear in the face Jesus so then the I see", "11:27", "the bear running off then I see someone", "11:29", "going down the mountain with the bear", "11:30", "I'm thinking he's got someone so I grab", "11:32", "my pistol start going down the mountain", "11:34", "yelling cowering up I guess I count off", "11:38", "and everyone's like what", "11:41", "right and then Garrett pops up out of", "11:44", "the bushes and his eye he's like", "11:46", "wide-eyed so Garrett aka dirt dirt myth", "11:49", "was the one who was on top of the", "11:51", "somehow he's on the Bears back so I", "11:54", "think when the bear wheeled around he", "11:56", "like hit him and he ends up on the back", "11:58", "so I saw just legs and bear going down", "12:00", "the mountain I saw his legs on the back", "12:03", "of the bear some thought like maybe the", "12:04", "bear had him in his job yeah that's what", "12:06", "I was thinking I mean what if that was", "12:11", "in a movie you like get the fuck out", "12:17", "[Laughter]", "12:20", "yeah and then we kind of circled up", "12:23", "around the tree and the real scary part", "12:26", "was that bear so it was so thick you", "12:29", "really couldn't see and you could see", "12:31", "maybe as far as the wall is from us with", "12:32", "was that the trees feet yeah and just", "12:36", "real thick brush and you'd hear the bear", "12:38", "charged in again and we only have the", "12:40", "two pistols Yanis and I and the the wind", "12:43", "was so strong there's no way we could", "12:45", "use bear spray so we hear the bear", "12:47", "charging in and me and Jana stir like", "12:50", "pistols out ready waiting for this thing", "12:51", "to pop out at point-blank range and then", "12:54", "it would anywhere yelling bear and then", "12:58", "that thing stops and then it would just", "13:00", "you crash off and then it would charge", "13:03", "in from the other direction like circle", "13:05", "around the tree the other way and did", "13:08", "that I think three times that was just", "13:10", "under it's like a horror movie where it", "13:12", "keeps coming in from different angles oh", "13:14", "it was weird it was not a fun feeling", "13:17", "you just felt so small so you guys had", "13:19", "come back to the carcass that was", "13:21", "hanging in the tree and it had probably", "13:22", "claimed that carcass we don't know", "13:25", "they knew the various was there I assume", "13:28", "now the the weird thing was is it came", "13:31", "in with the wind so in the wind was", "13:34", "blowing pretty stiff and say into her", "13:37", "face mm-hmm and the bear came in with", "13:39", "the wind so he wasn't going into the", "13:41", "scent right normally they go around they", "13:44", "catch the scent and they charge in so I", "13:46", "don't know if he'd heard something if he", "13:48", "was there we saw what slightly looked", "13:51", "like bear sign both steena Steve and I", "13:53", "kind of pointed it out but we weren't we", "13:57", "were thinking maybe it was something", "13:58", "older you wouldn't you say bear son you", "14:00", "mean bear shit the a bear shit in the", "14:01", "base of the tree yeah and so I think you", "14:05", "know we did some things that were wrong", "14:06", "but in in the instance what saved us all", "14:10", "now if we were to do it a hundred times", "14:12", "over I would say I would do it", "14:14", "differently but it worked out how it", "14:16", "worked out so I obviously I would never", "14:20", "mops to just have nothing and have this", "14:22", "weird scatter effect yeah but I think", "14:24", "that what saved everyone from getting", "14:26", "anyone from getting hurt which is a", "14:28", "miracle was the fact that when we", "14:30", "scattered it just confused that bear", "14:32", "because he kind of had this look after", "14:35", "he started he started wheeling around", "14:36", "kind of like trying to pick a person", "14:39", "trying to go and he couldn't target one", "14:42", "individual and then things started", "14:44", "hitting him and somebody's on his back", "14:46", "and I think it just freaked him out and", "14:48", "he went off to regroup keep charging", "14:50", "back in but never made that full charge", "14:52", "all the way back in again wow that's", "14:55", "crazy how many people have ever gone", "14:57", "through a bear attack unscathed like", "15:00", "that and a group of six yeah and the", "15:02", "thing about it was it wasn't just a bear", "15:06", "attack but had looking at it later had", "15:09", "someone even been grabbed and mauled not", "15:13", "to death but injured I think that it", "15:16", "would have been very unlikely that that", "15:18", "person was survived because we the", "15:21", "weather that came in was so bad I don't", "15:23", "know if it 100 mile an hour winds", "15:25", "I mean you aren't getting rescued in 100", "15:27", "mile an hour winds I wouldn't think", "15:28", "Brian", "15:29", "I don't know those Coast Guard", "15:30", "helicopters I'm not really sure what", "15:32", "they're capable of maybe someone to say", "15:34", "yeah we we'd go but that would be a very", "15:36", "hard thing the gusts were so bad when we", "15:39", "came back over the ridge to our camp now", "15:43", "we're all on edge you just want to get", "15:45", "back to camp to put it mildly", "15:46", "yeah every and and then of course we see", "15:49", "bears on the way back and were like", "15:51", "thinking is this Bergen follow us you", "15:54", "guys see on the way back one wonder so", "15:57", "we started barreled a different one", "15:58", "yeah smaller but still after that yeah", "16:03", "you're thinking now before that happened", "16:06", "we're thinking no bears will attack us", "16:07", "after that happened we're thinking every", "16:09", "bear will attack us and we start to go", "16:12", "over the ridge back toward camp I think", "16:15", "at that point I was in the front Steve", "16:17", "and someone else was behind me as we go", "16:20", "over this little saddle the wind hits", "16:21", "knocks the first three people over whoa", "16:24", "one of the guys have like a pack cover", "16:26", "on his pack ripped to that off and just", "16:28", "sent it in the never endeavors I mean it", "16:31", "went up and it was crazy I've never seen", "16:33", "anything blow away like that it just", "16:34", "went flying so then we get down the", "16:38", "winds are gusting the rains pouring we", "16:40", "look down the to two main tents are", "16:42", "destroyed", "16:43", "Stephen eyes tents are you know flopped", "16:46", "down on the ground I see somebody's", "16:47", "sleeping pad blowing away sleeping bag", "16:51", "is getting soaked so now we have a real", "16:53", "situation of hypothermia if the bear", "16:56", "didn't get us this hypothermia might and", "16:58", "we now no longer have a camp that we can", "17:01", "just go to so we've been attacked by a", "17:03", "bear our camps destroyed we get down", "17:06", "there one of the tents is jacked up we", "17:07", "can take all the camp down and relocate", "17:09", "behind the spruce gather up everybody", "17:12", "stuff mostly guys sleeping bags are wet", "17:15", "we end up like restringing the bear", "17:18", "fence around this new camp this is after", "17:21", "you've just had a full day and been", "17:23", "attacked by a bear and by bear fence", "17:26", "we're talking about one of those", "17:26", "electric fences yeah it's a little", "17:28", "electric how do those things work it's a", "17:30", "battery operated deal you run electric", "17:34", "fence it's like ribbond electric fence", "17:36", "just like a cattle yard would have you", "17:40", "run that around and then it's just off", "17:42", "of it", "17:42", "six D batteries that's it pulsus and it", "17:46", "just it tingles just a little bit it", "17:48", "doesn't really if you touch it it", "17:50", "doesn't really light you up so I think", "17:53", "they just I don't like that feeling",

predator call", "36:29", "and this wolf closed in on him", "36:32", "and literally jumped at him and he shot", "36:35", "it in the air so in his house he's had", "36:37", "it sounded like this he's got the the", "36:39", "wolf mounted like in the same position", "36:43", "it was in when it was trying to eat him", "36:44", "yeah see people people have to realize", "36:48", "that like I love wolves don't get me", "36:50", "wrong but you know once I started", "36:54", "hunting and then I started really", "36:55", "looking into wildlife conservation and", "36:58", "then the consequences of letting apex", "37:00", "predators get out of control like it's", "37:02", "scary yeah yeah that the wolves I've", "37:06", "never really been afraid of but I did", "37:08", "one time I was in Idaho

he used to take", "38:54", "down the elk so he's got three hours", "38:55", "left and he's got a guide with him and", "38:58", "the guide has a rifle but the guide only", "39:01", "has a handful of bullets he's got like", "39:03", "three or four bullets yeah", "39:04", "so they're standing there they're trying", "39:06", "to take this elk out there quartering it", "39:08", "up and then wolf starts circling them", "39:10", "and howling and then they realize like", "39:12", "oh fuck like we're literally in the", "39:16", "Wolves den and one wolf makes a dead run", "39:19", "at him he kills it with his bow another", "39:22", "wolf makes a dead run on it they shoot", "39:24", "it another wolf comes down he shoots it", "39:28", "with the rifle so John is shot too with", "39:30", "his bow and the other guy shot one with", "39:33", "a rifle", "39:33", "John's down to one air", "39:35", "and the other guy has like maybe two", "39:37", "bullets Wow", "39:38", "and they're freaking the fuck out they", "39:40", "have their back to a tree and wolves are", "39:41", "circling them and they're howling", "39:43", "because they've already lost three", "39:45", "wolves yeah so he's literally getting", "39:48", "charged by wolves with his back to a", "39:50", "tree with a giant elk carcass behind him", "39:52", "that they're trying to claim that's", "39:54", "crazy", "39:54", "crazing he said the alpha male was", "39:57", "standing on a ridge he drew back on the", "40:01", "on the wolf the wolf looked at him and", "40:03", "bolted and took off and the rest of him", "40:05", "took off a million yeah but he said they", "40:06", "were circling him howling from like", "40:09", "doing like a roll call like trying to", "40:11", "see who's still alive like what's going", "40:13", "on here", "40:13", "but even after a gunshot and two of them", "40:16", "killed with arrows it was still chart", "40:18", "that's crazy", "40:20", "fuck huh it's a great story yeah it is", "40:23", "it's terrifying yeah but just let you", "40:25", "know like people think well wolves don't", "40:27", "harm people in World War two the", "40:30", "Russians and the Germans had to call a", "40:32", "ceasefire because so many people were", "40:35", "getting killed by wolves they decided to", "40:37", "call a ceasefire kill the wolves and", "40:39", "then go back to killing each other", "40:40", "that's crazy it's a crazy story world", "40:43", "war one or two one I think it's one to", "40:45", "James it too was like fed on the dead", "40:49", "people well I think there were so many", "40:51", "wolves like Siberia or Russia wherever", "40:54", "the fuck they were there's a lot of", "40:55", "wolves you know and they don't give a", "40:57", "shit if you're a person or a chicken you", "41:01", "go for it yeah I mean it's cold it's", "41:02", "tough tough tough living is one it was", "41:05", "one it's a world war one yeah but but", "41:08", "it's a confirmed story I mean they just", "41:11", "guys would go out on Scouts and they", "41:14", "were just vanished and they they find", "41:15", "their boot with like half a foot still", "41:16", "in it and like fuck like people don't", "41:18", "realize like a wolf can cut through an", "41:21", "elk bone with its teeth yeah we need", "41:24", "when you see a wolf actually take down", "41:27", "and now it's pretty impressive if you", "41:29", "seen it live yeah I've seen it I've seen", "41:30", "a single seen a single wolf take down a", "41:34", "spike elk once and what it did was it", "41:38", "was just so fast too it ran in it ran it", "41:42", "downhill they're so smart too but it was", "41:46", "the elk was on a ridge the wolf starts", "41:48", "chasing", "41:48", "down and starts chasing the elk through", "41:50", "what we call deadfall where a bunch of", "41:52", "trees have fallen over so the elk has to", "41:54", "exert itself and jump over things and", "41:56", "then the wolf would come in and bite its", "41:58", "back legs and that that wolf was so fast", "42:01", "it could run almost between its legs as", "42:03", "that Elks running I mean it was crazy", "42:05", "and then it got its stomach open so it's", "42:08", "dragging its guts and then the elk", "42:10", "finally you would get its guts caught on", "42:13", "the trees that it was going over and got", "42:15", "it by the neck and just held it until it", "42:17", "died how far away 300 yards maybe Wow", "42:24", "yeah a lot of it some of it you couldn't", "42:27", "see you know because it was a hill", "42:28", "across from me so you could see it you'd", "42:30", "lose it in the timber then it'd come out", "42:31", "in a patch and then it was right below", "42:33", "us and then we just kind of backed out", "42:34", "and left it to its Doug they saw a", "42:36", "grizzly bear swat a moose down with one", "42:39", "shot", "42:40", "really he said the the Grizzly literally", "42:42", "lifted up its paw was chasing the moose", "42:44", "and slammed it on the mooses back and", "42:47", "broke its back really yeah that's how", "42:49", "strong a fucking grizzly bear yes he", "42:51", "said you couldn't you it's like to see", "42:53", "it is want like to see it as one thing", "42:56", "but to try to describe it it's like", "42:58", "there's no way I want to describe", "42:59", "because the amount of power that thing", "43:01", "had in its paw he goes it just gives you", "43:03", "a totally different perception of what", "43:05", "it's capable of you know you have an", "43:07", "idea well the Grizzlies big in the Moose", "43:08", "is big yeah kind of a brawl nope grizzly", "43:11", "swats it boom just snap just down most", "43:14", "just went like you got shot that's crazy", "43:17", "yeah when you see the power of them you", "43:19", "think yeah yeah the whole getting", "43:21", "scratched things probably that's not how", "43:23", "you're getting scratched you're getting", "43:25", "tore up so in BC they've recently they", "43:29", "passed two two laws the first law they", "43:31", "passed they were going to outlaw trophy", "43:33", "hunts so what they said is because", "43:35", "eating black bear is a traditional thing", "43:38", "a lot of people eat black bear a lot of", "43:39", "people that are you know that don't hunt", "43:42", "or don't have anything to do with", "43:42", "hunting don't know this but black bear", "43:44", "is eaten by a lot of people yeah grizzly", "43:47", "bears not eating as much but some people", "43:49", "eat it a lot of the indigenous people", "43:51", "eat it or whether they call First", "43:52", "Nations and yeah in Canada they they'll", "43:54", "eat brown bear some of them will but", "43:57", "they decided no more quote unquote", "44:00", "trophy hunts so", "44:02", "so you can't keep the skin and you", "44:04", "couldn't keep the head but you could", "44:06", "keep the meat okay so as a weird weird", "44:09", "law that got passed and people like well", "44:10", "that doesn't make any sense because", "44:11", "people you're I understand that they", "44:16", "would want the people to only hunt for", "44:17", "me that makes sense but why not allow", "44:20", "them to keep the skull and keep the Cape", "44:22", "and all that other stuff oh it's", "44:24", "wasteful yeah then they changed it", "44:26", "entirely and they said no Grizzly hunts", "44:28", "at all and it was really quickly the one", "44:30", "one law changed then it all changed and", "44:32", "they based it on a really small sampling", "44:34", "like they they had like I think was an", "44:37", "email sample kriti Bowman has a thing on", "44:39", "it they did a podcast on it but they", "44:41", "explained how it went down that it", "44:43", "wasn't", "44:44", "they said 75% of the population agrees", "44:46", "but it's not really 75% of the", "44:48", "population 75% of the 3,000 people that", "44:50", "they got responded to the email right", "44:52", "and or the online petition or whatever", "44:55", "the fuck it was but they have a problem", "44:58", "now these people that actually live", "44:59", "there like my friend Mike it's like okay", "45:02", "if you're if you're not gonna control", "45:03", "the populations of them like Mike how to", "45:05", "shoot one that literally had its face in", "45:07", "his cabin he opened the door and it was", "45:09", "literally he shot it like we're", "45:11", "literally right there like what were you", "45:13", "are it was trying to come in his cabin", "45:15", "and he shot it yeah I think that the", "45:18", "reason there's I've heard that there's", "45:21", "more people or attacked or affected by", "45:23", "black bears yeah then grizzly bears or", "45:26", "brown bears but it's just not as many", "45:27", "people live in proximity to them right", "45:30", "if you put a major metropolitan area on", "45:32", "the middle of fog neck island people be", "45:35", "getting jacked all the time", "45:37", "yeah yeah and that's what's going on", "45:39", "also in Montana I mean when these most", "45:42", "recent attacks it's just because there's", "45:45", "a large population of bears there and", "45:47", "you can't hunt them and the good thing", "45:49", "is that people hunted them almost to the", "45:51", "brink of extinction and now through", "45:53", "conservation they've brought them back", "45:55", "to the point where they're no longer", "45:56", "endangered but there's the the dispute", "45:59", "between the animal rights people and the", "46:01", "wildlife biologists and the hunters and", "46:03", "you know trying to figure out what what", "46:07", "how big does a population have to be", "46:08", "before you realize that you have to chop", "46:11", "some of them down like you don't nobody", "46:12", "wants to eliminate grizzly bears", "46:15", "you don't want a hundred thousand", "46:17", "grizzly bears in the metropolitan", "46:18", "Vancouver area", "46:20", "yeah and it's it's a weird it's kind of", "46:22", "a weird balance when you talking about", "46:24", "hunting and animal populations and then", "46:26", "you throw in predators because I don't", "46:29", "think a lot of people even understand", "46:31", "how humans have affected the environment", "46:33", "in such a negative way that nothing will", "46:36", "ever be as it was right people go oh", "46:39", "well the Predators will control the prey", "46:42", "populations and so why would we need to", "46:45", "control the Predators", "46:46", "well we've upset the balance in such a", "46:49", "way that if we don't insert ourselves", "46:52", "into the equation which as far as we", "46:56", "know like humans have bending the", "46:58", "equation hunting since the animals that", "47:01", "aren't currently in North America have", "47:03", "been around brown bears have always been", "47:05", "hunted by humans you know when you're", "47:07", "looking at the way things were", "47:09", "I mean indigenous people on it um people", "47:12", "before you know settlers and whatever", "47:15", "came in the bears were being hunted so", "47:17", "humans were always a natural predator of", "47:18", "the bears but the way that humans have", "47:22", "affected the landscape between obviously", "47:24", "taking up habitat I mean habitats the", "47:26", "number one thing is habitats gone", "47:29", "invasive plant species is crazy the type", "47:32", "of plants that grow in places they", "47:34", "shouldn't be now we'll never get rid of", "47:35", "those plants so because those plants are", "47:38", "their native plants that the animals", "47:40", "originally should be eating off of don't", "47:42", "exist they they're out competed by", "47:44", "noxious weeds and other things so the", "47:46", "amount of food source is smaller so then", "47:49", "the prey population cannot there they've", "47:53", "lost their winter range because of", "47:54", "developments and other things and then", "47:57", "if you just inserted and said well all", "47:58", "the Predators will take care of those", "48:00", "numbers - well that's not true because", "48:02", "the numbers can't get to what they were", "48:04", "because there's less availability", "48:06", "starting at the bottom level of food", "48:08", "source and winter range and habitat so", "48:12", "what do you do about though I mean is it", "48:14", "is it possible to kill all the invasive", "48:16", "plants no it's not possible no I mean", "48:20", "there's there's no way that like where", "48:22", "I'm from Nevada you you talk about", "48:25", "invasive plants there's those species of", "48:28", "grass sheep", "48:29", "grass own fires wipe through the native", "48:31", "grasses can't compete with that so the", "48:33", "cheatgrass takes over has less nutrients", "48:35", "and doesn't have the same type of browse", "48:36", "that the native deer and whatever", "48:38", "species deer and elk need mostly mule", "48:41", "deer where's this cheatgrass coming from", "48:44", "somebody brought it over because", "48:46", "ornamental and it's just gone rampant", "48:48", "most of our plants aren't native plants", "48:51", "now really good oh yeah you look at yeah", "48:53", "most of the plants that take over are", "48:56", "invasive plants", "48:57", "yeah our country's primarily invasive", "49:01", "species maybe someone will call me out", "49:02", "on this say that's not true but there's", "49:04", "more invasive plants than native plants", "49:06", "that's crazy yeah the grass is most of", "49:08", "the grasses that we have around aren't", "49:09", "from the region's", "49:11", "Kentucky bluegrass in California doesn't", "49:13", "make sense well it's always fascinating", "49:15", "to me when an animal gets into an area", "49:17", "where it doesn't have natural predators", "49:19", "it's like a nutria", "49:20", "yeah like nutria is down south and they", "49:23", "just have to hunt those things like all", "49:24", "over the place", "49:25", "giant rat thing yeah well I was just", "49:27", "over in Maui hunting access deer yeah", "49:31", "they said the populations there just", "49:33", "have exploded oh yeah they don't have", "49:35", "predators in all the native species", "49:38", "actually are being negatively affected", "49:41", "by the invasive species now were you", "49:44", "there how recently was this yesterday", "49:48", "yesterday yeah oh you just got back yeah", "49:50", "I got back what is it like in", "49:51", "relationship to where we hunted in lanai", "49:54", "it's very it's very similar different", "49:56", "different terrain a little more", "49:58", "mountainous terrain so probably kind of", "50:01", "cooler yeah a lot of lava a lot a lot of", "50:04", "rock and cliffs and some other stuff and", "50:06", "goes to the ocean and there's there's", "50:09", "kind of all different there's more of a", "50:11", "dry side of the island it's more about", "50:12", "lava type terrain and you've got bamboo", "50:15", "forests on the other side once the deer", "50:17", "get into that thick bamboo type forest", "50:19", "they'll never eradicate them same Wow", "50:21", "because just like the pigs and", "50:23", "everything they just can't get him out", "50:24", "of there yeah well the good news is", "50:26", "they've instituted a hunters for the", "50:30", "hungry type program in in Maui right", "50:32", "yeah correct yeah", "50:33", "so one of my one of my buddies that I", "50:35", "hunt with over there Rob and he he", "50:36", "started getting some of that rolling", "50:38", "where they could go on the ranches shoot", "50:41", "the deer off the", "50:42", "excess deer and then give them to people", "50:44", "that need food that's amazing", "50:46", "which they should be able to sure why", "50:49", "why not its it's the some of the", "50:51", "best-tasting meat there is yeah and", "50:53", "they're overrun with these animals", "50:55", "yeah that's an argument for hunting yeah", "50:58", "it's really difficult for animal rights", "50:59", "people to argue against because you", "51:01", "already have this invasive species", "51:03", "that's over populating this island and", "51:05", "either you're gonna bring in wolves", "51:07", "which is another invasive species which", "51:09", "isn't that similar to what they tried to", "51:11", "do in Australia", "51:12", "yeah Australia they started they try to", "51:13", "bring in a bunch I wish I was here they", "51:15", "brought foxes and cats but the foxes and", "51:17", "cats well you've got these marsupials", "51:20", "that are slow and lay eggs and don't run", "51:23", "away the rats rats hide and they're fast", "51:25", "platypuses don't ya and so Austin ground", "51:29", "nesting birds all that stuff so they", "51:30", "just hammer the native species and then", "51:34", "the invasive rats it might still just", "51:36", "take a toll on everything yeah what is", "51:38", "the solution to a place like lanai other", "51:41", "than hunting I mean you would have to", "51:43", "give the deer birth control or bring in", "51:46", "predators or poison or poisons that", "51:50", "these fair talks in New Zealand Oh God", "51:52", "you imagine just they use a poison", "51:55", "called ten and they will the fair talks", "51:57", "is mostly for opossums but they use a", "52:00", "poison called 1080 and it's serial", "52:03", "poison so they essentially coat cereal", "52:05", "which would be like grains and rice and", "52:07", "other things with this extremely deadly", "52:11", "poison and then they just dump it out of", "52:13", "helicopters into the forest it doesn't", "52:15", "discriminate no whatever's local as well", "52:20", "correct and you're putting I mean you're", "52:23", "you're dumping poison", "52:25", "it's crazy gonna get into the", "52:26", "groundwater yeah yeah I mean it's that's", "52:29", "so stupid what kind of what kind of", "52:31", "solution is that and if you think", "52:33", "hunting's bad yeah that poison is not an", "52:36", "easy death no no it's awful takes a long", "52:40", "time to and the thing is again like you", "52:42", "said that the meat is delicious yeah if", "52:45", "you just if they just had a program", "52:47", "where they went to Lanai and just shot", "52:51", "animals just for for hungry people in", "52:53", "Oahu or Maui", "52:55", "and they could have a lot of amazing", "52:57", "meals for

spearfishing", "64:57", "and the first time you held your breath", "64:58", "you couldn't hold it that long and then", "65:00", "they told you how to do it just a minute", "65:02", "you minute minute and a half something", "65:04", "so what was the difference it's all", "65:06", "mental really yeah so what do they tell", "65:08", "you to concentrate on just the fact that", "65:11", "you aren't gonna die mmm key and", "65:13", "relaxing when your heart rate starts to", "65:16", "see it's more about just controlling", "65:18", "things controlling your heart rate and", "65:20", "other stuff I'm no expert but I'm", "65:23", "there's people there really have been", "65:25", "spear fishing and diving as much as I go", "65:27", "hunting but I try to learn as much as I", "65:29", "can when I'm out with people that know", "65:31", "what they're doing and it's just a cool", "65:33", "experience of being underwater and you", "65:36", "get that little bit of a panic and you", "65:38",

techniques technically text to", "65:49", "breathe slow your heart rate and then", "65:52", "just knowing the fact of how to hold", "65:55", "your breath don't let it out and the", "65:58", "fact that what your body goes through", "66:00", "the stages that your body goes through", "66:01", "when you are out of oxygen it's when you", "66:05", "get to that end period you actually", "66:07", "almost feel like you don't need to", "66:09", "breathe it's really good yeah and that's", "66:11", "when you gotta breathe that's when you", "66:12", "gotta breathe because when", "66:14", "when I was done

that", "82:47", "struggle is where the happiness comes", "82:49", "from and most people are they think that", "82:51", "the happiness is avoiding the struggle", "82:53", "it's a real cat it's a trade you know", "82:56", "it's it's like that feeling that your", "82:58", "body gives you like when you don't want", "82:59", "to go to the gym like oh come on man", "83:01", "don't go but if you push through that", "83:03", "then afterwards like yeah yes I've no I", "83:07", "don't feel and then also you see the", "83:09", "results in your body whereas if you just", "83:11", "give in to that I'm

"86:40", "important to have that's that balance", "86:44", "since those muscles that you can't lift", "86:45", "for it's the weird being able to stand", "86:49", "on one leg and move around in every", "86:51", "direction because especially when you", "86:53", "got weight on your back you're packing", "86:55", "something out that kind of weird agility", "86:57", "strength training and those guys

on and", "88:28", "go for", "88:28", "for work I do that for 12 hours a day", "88:31", "it's like the one hour I go do it when", "88:34", "I'm not working isn't gonna do much for", "88:36", "me your back must be like really fucking", "88:38", "strong for you think about 1718 years of", "88:41", "doing that yeah I mean your back must be", "88:43", "ridiculous yeah it's and you know you're",

I'd", "88:55", "probably break you down yeah but doing", "88:57", "it once a week that gives your body a", "88:58", "chance to break down and then slowly", "89:00", "recover most I'm that guy that's

and", "89:55", "I've kind of when I start when I was say", "90:00", "late teens or whatever trying to I'd see", "90:04", "elk and just trying to be able to get", "90:06", "that endurance where I never had to stop", "90:07", "and what I would do is I would go out", "90:10", "and I would do something that was", "90:13", "prolonged to where the point that I had", "90:16", "to stop", "90:16", "I wouldn't stop but I would switch the", "90:18", "way that I did did it so say I pick a", "90:20", "mountain or he stairs or whatever and", "90:22", "you can run and then the point that", "90:24", "you'd have to I'd have to stop I'd turn", "90:26", "around and start walking backwards and", "90:27", "then I would turn to start sidestepping", "90:29", "and I would refuse to stop so I'd pick a", "90:31", "point that I knew I couldn't or almost", "90:34", "couldn't get to if I walked up a", "90:35", "mountain one day and thought I have to", "90:37", "stop now at that point where had to stop", "90:39", "I would just switch the type of muscle", "90:41", "and movement that Oh", "90:41", "do so I thought okay like if you're some", "90:45", "kind of workout mmm whatever that", "90:47", "workout is but like some kind of say", "90:51", "stairs or whatever if you're running", "90:53", "stairs and you go until your body's like", "90:56", "absolutely I cannot go anymore but keep", "91:00",

front", "91:17", "kicks and weirdly enough I have energy", "91:19", "to do that yeah so I almost can't kick", "91:21", "the way I've been kicking but I can kick", "91:23", "otherwise yeah it's a weird way that I", "91:25", "started just building endurance to the", "91:27", "point where then I never had to stop but", "91:29", "if you're a guy lives in a flat area you", "91:32", "get that's that's exactly it I don't", "91:34", "know you'd have to get like I've seen", "91:35", "guys on those stair machines where it's", "91:38", "a rotating stairs and they have a", "91:39", "backpack on a heavy back I think that", "91:41", "would be the way to do it and then not", "91:42", "and then try to go for like five or six", "91:44", "hours fuck nobody's gonna do that no", "91:49", "that's the thing you you no one's ever", "91:51", "prepared that's the thing is I mean I", "91:54", "hate to say it but how do you prepare it", "91:56", "well you just have to do it you can't", "91:57", "you can't actually go into a go into a", "92:02", "gym and think that you're gonna be able", "92:04", "to carry a heavy pack for days at a time", "92:05", "no there's no like for what I do at a", "92:10", "hiking speed carrying a pack I'm really", "92:12", "good at that but this year we went in we", "92:15", "wanted to go in to this spot there's a", "92:16", "little bit further and I got on a bike I", "92:18", "got smoked - 65 years old he rides a", "92:23", "bike all the time I don't right I don't", "92:25", "even know if I I knew how to ride a bike", "92:27", "when I got on it but it kicked my ass so", "92:30", "it's just different it's like you know", "92:32", "all the hiking every day with the pack I", "92:35", "thought oh no this will be no problem", "92:37", "and I get on that bike and get my ass", "92:38", "kicked", "92:39", "it's like you cannot yeah you have to do", "92:42", "to do in a certain level but there's", "92:44", "certain things like you could probably", "92:46", "do you could I could pedal you know in a", "92:49", "little bit then I'd be like on a", "92:51", "stationary bike every day and then you", "92:53", "more muscle memory for that type of", "92:55", "action so if you did the stair thing I", "92:57", "think that's probably the closest you", "92:59", "could get to get that muscle memory yeah", "93:01", "I think would be a stair thing yeah or", "93:03", "finding actual stairs actual stairs", "93:05", "running up the stairs yeah there's a", "93:07", "good place out here in Calabasas that", "93:10", "has several it's up the side of this", "93:13",

"93:20", "people in the Midwest where it's flat", "93:23", "she'd open up gyms like rent stairwells", "93:25", "you just have packs at the bottom people", "93:27", "get a membership I can just go up the", "93:29", "stairs as many times as they want up and", "93:31", "down the stairs it's amazing how just", "93:32", "carrying your body up hills is so", "93:35", "difficult I think it doesn't - a person", "93:38", "who never does it like oh we're hiking", "93:39", "that's like walking but you're walking", "93:41", "outside no yeah it's way harder it just", "93:45", "doesn't seem like it should be you know", "93:47", "every every ounce of weight on your body", "93:49", "or you even your shoes people buy these", "93:52", "real heavy mountaineering boots like", "93:53", "those are the and then

some duct tape on", "98:23", "that just some duct tape on him you you", "98:24", "take a lot of guys out that have never", "98:26", "hunted before yeah how often you do that", "98:29", "every year", "98:29", "Oh a couple times a year I would say", "98:33", "what is the did you enjoy that is that", "98:36", "yeah I had experience no it's fun for me", "98:38", "it's mostly guys that they may have", "98:41", "tried and may have been successful or it", "98:43", "might be their first real type big game", "98:47", "type hunt or whatever I like it because", "98:49", "I get to be a part of the experience and", "98:53", "kind of help shape that first experience", "98:57", "because you could go out with some I", "98:58", "mean I kind of say some hunt there are", "99:01", "hunters out there that fit the", "99:03", "stereotype mm-hmm and it's a shame yeah", "99:05", "I think somebody that's getting into", "99:06", "hunting if they go with somebody that", "99:08", "fits that stereotype then they're", "99:09", "probably gonna have a bad experience and", "99:11", "that's not what hunting is to me so I", "99:13", "think that by me being able to kind of", "99:16", "help form that first experience and make", "99:18", "it about the experience because for me", "99:21", "when I go out hunting it's not just", "99:22", "about killing something it's about the", "99:25", "entire experience around it's the that's", "99:27", "what hunting is you go out into the", "99:29", "woods you there's just certain things", "99:32", "that I do that other people might not do", "99:34", "but there are a lot of people that do it", "99:35", "say I mean I pay attention to the plants", "99:38", "that are there I pay attention to really", "99:40", "everything you know the things that I", "99:42", "noticed someone else might notice so I", "99:43", "point those out to them and and just", "99:45", "like give them an overall good", "99:47", "experience of why we're out there and", "99:50", "what we're doing and that's fun well I", "99:53", "think a lot of people have an idea what", "99:55", "a hunter is from television or from the", "99:57", "movies or from duck dynasty or something", "99:59", "like that and a lot of that is maybe", "100:02", "even treestand hunters who are maybe", "100:04", "overweight not fit and they don't", "100:06", "understand that Western big-game style", "100:09", "hunting like you do is really an", "100:11", "athletic endeavor as well as a skill as", "100:14", "well as like really comprehensive", "100:20", "knowledge based approach to problem", "100:24", "solving like you have to know what", "100:25", "you're doing there's a so many factors", "100:27", "so much that goes into it I mean you're", "100:29", "backpacking you're you've got you also", "100:32", "have to have a certain amount of bush", "100:34", "skills yeah and I call it like there's a", "100:36", "lot of people that do it but they don't", "100:38", "have those those little nuanced skills", "100:41", "that you pick up over over time there's", "100:44", "a lot of things that I do that maybe", "100:45", "people that have hunted their whole", "100:46", "life's won't even notice just the more", "100:48", "you do things the more the better you", "100:50", "get at it the more you notice the more", "100:52", "you've had times the more times you", "100:53", "fucked up and then figure it out why", "100:55", "that got messed up and then you try to", "100:57", "remedy it in the future don't do it this", "100:59", "way and you just start paying attention", "101:01", "to really small things that other people", "101:03", "might not pay attention to just like the", "101:06", "way that I so it's really weird I've", "101:08", "noticed even went from when I first", "101:09", "started hunting till now the way that I", "101:11", "do things is just completely different", "101:14", "this it's almost like I have a method", "101:16", "and a system but it's all based on the", "101:18", "millions of times that things haven't", "101:20", "gone right and trying to to progress and", "101:22", "to be a better hunter right like you see", "101:25", "this situation like okay I've fucked", "101:27", "this up before exactly I've know I know", "101:29", "what's going on here why is the wind at", "101:30", "the back of my neck I gotta get out of", "101:32", "here now I got it back down go around go", "101:34", "around don't just try to push it when", "101:36", "you pick areas that's what people that I", "101:38", "hunt with I'll go into a new area and", "101:40", "I'll be fairly successful for not going", "101:42", "into that area but I've done it enough", "101:44", "times to where okay I do things a", "101:46", "certain way", "101:47", "and it is constantly

facing me or things that I", "101:58", "don't know it's really hard to explain", "102:00", "when I'm out there I can explain it a", "102:02", "lot better yeah I can explain okay this", "102:04", "is what I'm doing this is why I'm doing", "102:05", "it and then there's other stuff that you", "102:06", "do the easiest it's just more of an", "102:08", "instinct than anything and I think a lot",

that's why I kind of", "104:27", "like think of instincts is like a bunch", "104:28", "of ones and zeros in the computer so you", "104:31", "don't really think about all the ones", "104:32", "and 0

unbelievable is that", "105:55", "that's the most intense experience", "105:57", "you've ever had in the woods ah intense", "106:01", "in that in a different way it I've had a", "106:04", "lot of just moments area is there just", "106:07", "intense in different ways but yeah that", "106:11", "one was that one was pretty intense in", "106:13", "the way that I thought oh this bears", "106:16", "gonna fucking kill me a big part of what", "106:18", "hunting is too is being able to stay", "106:20", "calm in that moment yeah", "106:23", "and because you're you're looking for an", "106:25", "animal you're hiking you're exhausted", "106:27", "day in day out you're out there for a", "106:29", "long time and then all of a sudden it", "106:31", "comes down to one moment and that one", "106:32",

there yeah you", "106:42", "can't be thinking about something else", "106:43", "cuz you just fuck it and you can't be", "106:45", "freaking out you can't go you're gonna", "106:46", "go oh my god I can't believe this is", "106:47", "happening", "106:47", "you can't think that either anybody does", "106:49", "happen I mean you can freak out you're", "106:51", "even I've done it a thousand times you", "106:54", "get that like rush of I guess it's that", "106:57", "rush of adrenaline", "106:58", "yeah do you have something that that you", "107:01", "say in your head like when you draw back", "107:04", "your bow or anything like that idea of", "107:05", "like a series of things like a checklist", "107:07", "that you go off a few things I just I", "107:10", "guess with my bow the one thing I think", "107:13", "it because I have a trigger release so I", "107:15", "just try to feel the trigger in my", "107:18", "finger in the corner of my finger so", "107:21", "then I know that I'm not gonna like slap", "107:23", "it or punch hitter so if I'm thinking", "107:25", "about that but mostly I'm focusing on", "107:27", "where I'm yeah I guess I my checklist", "107:29", "it'd be like draw a back pick a spot", "107:31", "feel the trigger let it go", "107:34", "did you ever have any classic archery", "107:36", "training you know no no I probably would", "107:41", "should you at this point in time well", "107:42", "yes I was talking to devil yeah he's", "107:44", "like he's like you could pick up a", "107:46", "rubber band and a pencil and kill", "107:48", "something with it like you just have the", "107:50", "instinct to do it but I've noticed when", "107:53", "I started hunting with a bow I just kind", "107:56", "of tried to pick it up myself and I did", "107:58", "everything wrong but I would go to these", "108:00", "3d shoots and win them not like like", "108:04", "real tournaments but just like local", "108:06", "things right you know though I'm the", "108:08", "best shot around that's great and then", "108:11", "guys would be like hey you're shooting", "108:12", "wrong you're doing and I", "108:13", "just would slap the trigger and I never", "108:15", "thought about holding still I would", "108:17", "always just shoot with movement because", "108:18", "I started shooting a like a longbow and", "108:23", "I would watch was at the time tienen", "108:26", "outdoors and this guy named Byron", "108:28", "Ferguson have you ever seen", "108:29", "this dude would throw up an aspirin and", "108:31", "shoot it out of the air oh one of those", "108:33", "over and over yeah and his whole thing", "108:35", "was be the arrow that was my only", "108:37", "archery advice be the arrow that's all I", "108:39", "knew", "108:39", "so you just be the arrow it made no", "108:42", "sense but I'd be out there I had a ball", "108:44", "on a string in the backyard and I would", "108:46", "like a softball and swing the softball", "108:48", "back and forth and just tell myself beat", "108:50", "the arrow be the arrow shoot made no", "108:53", "sense and then when I got a compound go", "108:55", "I just be the arrow so I just move and", "108:57", "when it felt right I've let her who let", "108:59", "her rip but you've obviously made", "109:01", "adjustments because you don't move yeah", "109:03", "I done the shot right now so in the", "109:05", "process of switching the way that I", "109:07", "shoot had developed a few bad habits", "109:11", "which now I think if I would have just", "109:14", "stuck with it it had been fine but now", "109:17", "that I've tried to switch then I kind of", "109:19", "tried it all those bad habits that I had", "109:21", "originally try to creep back in and it", "109:24", "doesn't really in the end I do really", "109:27", "well so it doesn't really matter but I", "109:29", "like the idea of trying new things and", "109:32", "there's always room for improvement you", "109:34", "should talk to Dudley yeah you should go", "109:36", "over some coaching with him yeah what's", "109:38", "interesting to me is that I've seen a", "109:41", "bunch of guys who are like very", "109:44", "accomplished hunters and very", "109:46", "accomplished archers and they they get", "109:49", "real weird around him really because", "109:51", "they know he's a master yeah he's a", "109:53", "master of form and technique and he does", "109:55", "it absolutely the right way and people", "109:57", "do not like to get in like shootouts", "109:59", "with him yeah when you have like little", "110:01", "competitions he's too fucking accurate", "110:03", "yeah he's ridiculous he's shot we did a", "110:06", "video for on it where he shot a", "110:08", "kettlebell handle at a hundred and", "110:10", "twenty yards he shot in in the hand in", "110:12", "hand yeah at night and the sparks", "110:15", "because he did it at night like he set a", "110:17", "lighted nock in there and aim for the", "110:19", "lighted nock and and shot it through and", "110:21", "you can see the sparks is the broad head", "110:23", "hits the bottom of the handle yeah", "110:27", "the the top phase of the kettlebell he's", "110:29", "ridiculous shot but everything he does", "110:31", "is textbook and writes like a technical", "110:34", "he's yeah he and he does that when he's", "110:37", "hunting too I mean he does that with", "110:38", "everything so it's real weird like guys", "110:40", "almost have this thing in their head", "110:42", "like I don't want to fuck with it it's", "110:43", "already already very successful doing", "110:46", "this way I don't want to change anything", "110:47", "yeah like I'm not listening you", "110:48", "ba-ba-ba-ba like some guys will try to", "110:51", "revamp their whole system but a lot of", "110:53", "really successful guys won't and they", "110:55", "get real weird around him it's very", "110:56", "interesting to watch I guess see that", "110:58", "old if it's not broken don't fix it but", "111:00", "I'm not that type I don't really if", "111:02", "somebody's really good at something I", "111:03", "want to learn from them yeah like you", "111:05", "know if he came to me and was like hey I", "111:07", "want to know my thing isn't technical", "111:10", "archery my thing is being out outdoor", "111:13", "skills survival skills hunting being in", "111:16", "the woods yeah you know if he's like hey", "111:17", "man I want to know some more stuff about", "111:19", "stalking mountain goats and wherever be", "111:24", "like okay cool I can tell you what I", "111:26", "know and I didn't ask him the same thing", "111:28", "like tell me about some archery stuff", "111:30", "because there's always where areas where", "111:32", "I can improve yeah and I'm not so stuck", "111:34", "in my ways that I need to do it the way", "111:37", "I've been doing it I'm not there's", "111:39", "definitely better ways to do things", "111:41", "but you can definitely get by the way", "111:42", "you're doing it really well here's John", "111:44", "yeah okay so he put a light on it that's", "111:47", "what he did yeah but you want to talk", "111:55", "about a guy who loves archery yeah he", "111:57", "loves coaching it he loves doing it like", "112:00", "that's it's a perfect thing for him he", "112:03", "loves it and he loves teaching people", "112:06", "how to do it too but if you watch his", "112:08", "form it's just absolutely perfect yeah", "112:11", "that's cool yeah and that's what I mean", "112:13", "I love bow hunting that's my passion and", "112:15", "I'll still go rifle hunting depending on", "112:18", "the hunt how often the rifle on every", "112:20", "year that's a good question you know I", "112:23", "might do one or two once a year I always", "112:26", "the one hunt generally because I guide", "112:29", "during the elk season in Montana so my", "112:31", "thing is elk meat is my number one thing", "112:35", "that I want in the freezer so I", "112:37", "generally save a few days at the end of", "112:39", "season you go out", "112:40", "try to kill an elk with a rifle it's", "112:42", "mostly just because I'm from dummy yeah", "112:45", "easier you know and I don't and there's", "112:47", "nothing wrong with rifling there and", "112:49", "they're the thing about that I if I take", "112:51", "a rifle it's also that challenge thing", "112:53", "so I might go into an area where the", "112:55", "odds of me getting something are with a", "112:58", "rifle even would be a hundred or say", "113:03", "multiple times less than the odds of me", "113:06", "going into an area with a bone getting", "113:08", "something right because low density load", "113:11", "in sea mammals or even well with elk I", "113:14", "think it's actually easier to get an elk", "113:16", "maybe people be like nah that's bullshit", "113:18", "but it's easier to get an elk with a bow", "113:20", "than a rifle turn the RUS yeah during", "113:23", "the rut because most archery seasons are", "113:25", "during the rut that's the easiest time", "113:27", "to it would be like a no-brainer with a", "113:30", "rifle and during brother right cuz", "113:31", "animals are all distracted and when", "113:33", "you're trying to hump and it mostly", "113:34", "across the West the elk season with a", "113:37", "rifle a general elk season is it the", "113:39", "absolute worst time to finding out just", "113:41", "seeing an elk right is the struggle you", "113:43", "might go five days and not see an elk in", "113:45", "some areas it's probably really cold", "113:46", "really cold archery equipment might not", "113:50", "even work in some of those temperatures", "113:51", "sometimes you draw like well icicles and", "113:54", "your yeah rosin it gets wet and then", "113:57", "it's frozen and he tried to shoot and", "113:59", "how did you start going to Montana", "114:01", "my grandpa actually lived there I just", "114:05", "went there summers and grew up kind of", "114:09", "in hunting that area part of the", "114:12", "Bitterroot Valley Southwest Montana", "114:14", "what's that near Missoula yeah I just", "114:18", "grew up hunting there and you know with", "114:21", "Bruce Lee's there no there's no", "114:22", "Grizzlies there some areas in Montana", "114:24", "have them some don't yeah correct what's", "114:27", "that about well they have them in the", "114:30", "park and then the main population and", "114:33", "then they did the reintroductions", "114:34", "and say-so glacier has them Yellowstone", "114:38", "has them they reintroduce Grizzlies to", "114:40", "certain areas yeah really", "114:42", "outside of Glacier in some areas yes", "114:44", "they do they get problem Grizzlies and", "114:46", "trap them or something as far as I know", "114:48", "yeah they did do some transplants or", "114:52", "reintroductions", "114:54", "but those parks have had them and then", "114:55", "the ones in that Greater Yellowstone", "114:57", "area have spread out and in that glacier", "115:01", "you've spread out Montana is a very", "115:03", "unusual place such a small population", "115:05", "but the people there like I've only been", "115:08", "to Bozeman and Billings when we went and", "115:12", "hunted the Missouri Breaks but people", "115:14", "are very nice it's a really cool area", "115:16", "interesting it's like they're not", "115:17", "they're not Hicks yeah no they're tuned", "115:19", "in it's weird", "115:21", "Montana has a small population but that", "115:23", "population explodes in the summer with", "115:25", "all the with the parks there right so", "115:28", "its tourists type people coming in and", "115:31", "that's why I mean it seems like I don't", "115:35", "actually have the stats but it seems", "115:36", "like the lot almost every year somebody", "115:38", "dies from a grizzly now or multiple", "115:41", "people it's a lot of people have been", "115:43", "getting attacked and I think it's just", "115:44", "the amount of people that are there and", "115:48", "just think that they're cuddly cute", "115:49", "animals and they don't really have", "115:52", "precautions because I think if you go on", "115:54", "a hunt in Alaska where we went in a fog", "115:57", "neck you're probably a lot safer than", "115:59", "the tourists going into Yellowstone just", "116:02", "because you you're you should be", "116:03", "prepared you've got the idea that these", "116:05", "bears are dangerous and they're probably", "116:06", "gonna come at you in some way you need", "116:09", "to be ready at all times and you go into", "116:12", "Yellowstone you're like or Glacier Park", "116:14", "there's a lot of attacks around they've", "116:15", "delisted bears they're right yeah", "116:18", "they're there delisted now but they", "116:20", "don't have a season open for hunting but", "116:22", "that's under debate correct so the ideas", "116:24", "there are populations have reached a", "116:26", "steady or maybe even over that level yep", "116:31", "yeah they're no longer they're no longer", "116:33", "threatened or potentially endangered", "116:37", "there's known they aren't gonna go", "116:39", "extinct right yeah", "116:40", "and they you ever see the short-faced", "116:43", "bear you ever see images of the bear", "116:46", "that used to live somewhere in the", "116:49", "bering land mass yeah in US and Asia", "116:51", "it's a way bigger than even a grizzly", "116:53", "very large yeah they think that's what", "116:55", "made of might have kept people from", "116:58", "migrating to North America quicker", "117:00", "that's crazy well they say they say that", "117:04", "polar bears still actively hunt", "117:07", "people you know which is a those bears", "117:11", "they do have a different temperament now", "117:12", "I think that the Bears in Montana", "117:16", "just keep going back to bears but the", "117:17", "Bears in Montana landlocked grizzly", "117:20", "bears just seem to be slightly more", "117:23", "aggressive than the larger coastal brown", "117:26", "bears just because they don't have as", "117:28", "much food they're always slightly pissed", "117:30", "off they always see everything as a", "117:33", "potential meal and everything is like", "117:35", "they look at mammals moving around the", "117:36", "ground as a meals because like the Bears", "117:38", "and the coastal they looking at salmon", "117:40", "salmon most of the year yeah they're not", "117:42", "thinking of things walking around as", "117:43", "being food yeah well the salmon are a", "117:46", "very large food source but only in the", "117:48", "fall right so for a quarter of the year", "117:51", "did you ever see that BBC special or the", "117:54", "guy they put him in a giant plexiglass", "117:56", "box yeah and they dropped him off", "117:59", "somewhere where there's a large

outdoor TV to get a look at", "121:20", "your approach and your philosophy and", "121:22", "the way you look at things because I", "121:23", "think that guys like you and Rinella and", "121:26", "cam hands and Dudley very valuable yeah", "121:30", "because people have this sense that you", "121:33", "said were you talking about like the", "121:34", "stereo", "121:34", "typical idea of what a hunter is they", "121:36", "have this idea of what it is and they", "121:39", "see a guy like you and they go oh this", "121:40", "guy's like more like an athlete like", "121:42", "this is more like a pursuit this is more", "121:44", "like an endurance skill thing on top of", "121:47", "being a hunting thing like there's a lot", "121:49", "of a lot of variables here that most", "121:52", "people don't take into consideration", "121:54", "it's why I think it's so important to", "121:55", "that's why I really enjoyed having you", "121:57", "on a podcast and having guys like you", "121:59", "want to talk about the stuff so people", "122:01", "get an understanding of it in a", "122:02", "different way yeah thanks I appreciate", "122:04", "that yeah it's nice to be able to kind", "122:06", "of share what I do with a population", "122:08", "that might not really understand it", "122:10", "because I think if you really look at it", "122:11", "hunting in general and the way that", "122:14", "myself and I'm not the exception there's", "122:17", "a lot of people that yeah hunt the way", "122:19", "that I do especially out west I think", "122:22", "that if you really understand that way", "122:23", "then you kind of start to get a grasp of", "122:26", "it's not bad it's actually a better", "122:28", "system than some of the systems that we", "122:30", "have around now and I think some of the", "122:31", "stuff that I'm going to be doing in the", "122:32", "future will really just give people more", "122:35", "access to that and you know right now", "122:37", "you can go get like there's solo hunter", "122:38", "episodes we have a we we decide to put", "122:41", "them all on our website and you like a", "122:42", "solo hunter all-access kind of thing", "122:45", "just like a subscription you can go on", "122:47", "there and just watch anything that we've", "122:48", "done", "122:49", "there's just think that a lot of times", "122:54", "what's happening with that just stories", "122:58", "that are being told about hunting it's", "123:00", "it's all everyone's preaching to the", "123:01", "converted", "123:02", "yeah and occasionally something comes", "123:05", "along like this podcast where people", "123:07", "maybe would have a prejudiced idea of", "123:10", "what it is then they get introduced to a", "123:11", "guy like you or Rennell and go oh these", "123:13", "aren't meatheads these aren't dumb", "123:15", "people like this is a different thing", "123:17", "and then they realize like this is", "123:18", "actually a very difficult honorable", "123:22", "pursuit in a very respectful pursuit and", "123:24", "really hard to do you were talking about", "123:27", "like what the kind of physical fitness", "123:29", "levels that are required of you the the", "123:31", "knowledge and understanding this is not", "123:33", "like some easy thing where you go into", "123:35", "the mountains and just go find an animal", "123:38", "that's trying to survive and kill it", "123:39", "especially with a bow and arrow it's not", "123:41", "no no it's not easy I think if anyone I", "123:44", "used to hear those comments the people", "123:46", "don't owe you big hundred", "123:47", "they're in queue an animal with a gun or", "123:50", "boat whatever go give it a try", "123:53", "see if you can do it cause it's not as", "123:55", "easy as you might think it's", "123:57", "unbelievably it is it's very difficult I", "123:59", "mean they smell you hundreds of yards", "124:00", "away they like fuck this guy and they're", "124:02", "gone yeah and you're never gonna come", "124:04", "close to him yeah and a lot of people's", "124:06", "interactions with wildlife are in urban", "124:08", "zones or in national parks that's like", "124:10", "it's like Disneyland it's like going to", "124:12", "the zoo it's not like where I go into", "124:15", "remote wilderness areas where the", "124:17", "animals are completely wild and you have", "124:20", "no support system no net of safety and", "124:24", "you just have to rely on your skills and", "124:26", "your ability and you're just another", "124:27", "like you're just another predator out", "124:30", "there on the mountain and there are", "124:31", "things and those some of those places", "124:32", "that want to eat you and you just you", "124:34", "have to adapt and deal with it and be", "124:36", "prepared and and go off those skills are", "124:38", "those solo backpacking trips your", "124:40", "favorite ones oh by far yeah I love that", "124:42", "I love it in in those mouths there's", "124:45", "some there's some hunts that I used to", "124:47", "do a lot of that I try to like they're", "124:50", "actually looking back on Manas way", "124:53", "dangerous I probably shouldn't do that", "124:55", "alone and then I still go do it but", "124:57", "there's gonna be some point well where", "125:00", "Rennell and I hunted and got attacked by", "125:02", "that mirabehn in there very quite a few", "125:04", "times probably three or four times alone", "125:08", "solo what yeah", "125:10", "hunting deer and a life in there yeah", "125:12", "and and I think about it go yeah that's", "125:16", "stupid terribly terribly but and to be", "125:19", "honest there's times that I've been in", "125:21", "there by myself and taken less", "125:23", "precaution and I remember one specific", "125:25", "time I was stalking a black tail and I", "125:28", "pull I had my pistol in my backpack", "125:29", "which now obviously I would never do", "125:32", "again but I have my bear spray on my hip", "125:34", "and my pistol I pull it out", "125:36", "I have no bullets in the thing and I'm", "125:38", "on a fog nag island thinking I would be", "125:42", "dead I would have been dead if that", "125:43", "would have happened and I wasn't by", "125:45", "myself and I've been in that the shitty", "125:47", "thing is I've been the thing that really", "125:49", "kind of pissed me off later was thinking", "125:51", "the amount of times I've been in those", "125:52", "situations alone and just thinking man I", "125:56", "got to relax on that", "125:58", "why did you not have bullets in the gun", "126:00", "is that just one of those things we've", "126:01", "just been there too many times and just", "126:03", "anything so well and I did I did have", "126:07", "bear spray and I think oh the bear spray", "126:09", "is good enough but now knowing the way", "126:11", "that that bear charged in bear spray", "126:13", "would have been completely useless does", "126:14", "run right through it well the wind was", "126:16", "blowing so so fast in our faces we would", "126:19", "have blinded ourselves probably now", "126:21", "whether you're coated with bear spray", "126:22", "and it Ward's the bear off I don't know", "126:24", "no I wouldn't know you want to whip out", "126:27", "like jalapeno sauce you want to whip out", "126:28", "bear spray in 70 mile an hour winds that", "126:31", "blowing in your face maybe that time", "126:32", "you're probably 40 50 miles an hour but", "126:34", "that bear spray is not gonna work in", "126:37", "that no that's ridiculous the bear", "126:40", "sprays I mean I bet it works some of the", "126:43", "time yeah I think in in some instances", "126:45", "it's probably a lot more effective my", "126:47", "friend Johnny rivet said he sprayed it", "126:48", "right in the Grizzlies face and the", "126:50", "Grizzly walked right through it he just", "126:51", "closed his eyes and then shook his head", "126:54", "and then walk right through it yeah I", "126:55", "think that there's now I think I just", "126:58", "carried both there are certain instances", "127:00", "where that is probably better option", "127:02", "yeah because I've got shooting something", "127:05", "that's charging with the pistol is very", "127:06", "difficult yeah in that situation I think", "127:09", "caliber that was a 44 Magnum I think in", "127:11", "in that situation you're really relying", "127:13", "on it when the Bears on top of you oh", "127:16", "it's just the last-ditch effort any of", "127:21", "those and even those any kind of", "127:23", "deterrent you have I think is just hard", "127:26", "to hard to really like when it comes", "127:30", "down it's either gonna go down and", "127:32", "you're gonna get away and stare or", "127:34", "you're not you don't do you think trying", "127:36", "you can horrific experience made that", "127:40", "place more attractive to you in about a", "127:42", "year yeah I think so the answer before I", "127:47", "asked it yes I was hoping cries the", "127:50", "weather sucks it's hard walking around", "127:52", "now I know that the bear attacks are", "127:55", "legit", "127:56", "okay let's go back I mean I'll go I'll", "127:58", "go back there next year not deer for", "128:00", "sure yeah and I put in four tags in a", "128:02", "different area in there so I'll go back", "128:04", "I wasn't", "128:06", "it wasn't one of those type of", "128:07", "experiences where you go I think even if", "128:09", "I had got tore up a little bit I would", "128:11", "still", "128:11", "go back that's just Li yeah it's not", "128:14", "tore up a little bit the fun like lived", "128:16", "through it", "128:17", "oh yeah what if you like lost half your", "128:19", "nose I probably go I'd probably start", "128:22", "bear hunting yeah I have once it was it", "128:31", "was one of those things I thought I'll", "128:33", "do it I had an opportunity and I wasn't", "128:37", "I'm not I'm not really just I'm not like", "128:40", "big into bear hunting the meat to me is", "128:43", "it's good it's okay but I just it's not", "128:46", "like it's not you know it's not my thing", "128:47", "and you can't eat it medium-rare no", "128:50", "exactly that's my yeah and and the other", "128:54", "thing is there is like some of its might", "128:58", "just be like you have emotional", "129:00", "connections and certain things like I", "129:02", "would I don't have any desire to go on", "129:04", "an African lion it's just not like you", "129:07", "just whatever yeah you know and not that", "129:10", "I don't know I mean now if there's this", "129:13", "thing where it's like you save the", "129:14", "species you have to go hunt an African", "129:16", "lion and I probably do it but it's not", "129:18", "something that appeals to me yeah but", "129:20", "that's like to say to save mankind you", "129:22", "know you you have to go fuck Jennifer", "129:24", "Beale but um I did I didn't hunt bears", "129:35", "it's wrong with my memory that's weird I", "129:38", "couldn't come up with a current hot", "129:39", "chick how weird", "129:42", "but you did I did yeah and I it was like", "129:46", "a weird so what the area that I went", "129:48", "into it was a predator control area and", "129:53", "it's an area that the state of Alaska so", "129:56", "the state of Alaska works different than", "129:58", "other places so I actually went and met", "130:00", "with biologists and kind of like it was", "130:02", "like could what's the deal with this and", "130:03", "so the deal was that there's the state", "130:07", "of Alaska has to manage their wildlife", "130:09", "populations for subsistence subsistence", "130:12", "food sources it's like mandated by the", "130:15", "state so in that particular area that", "130:18", "the predator populations got so high", "130:21", "that the moose populations and", "130:25", "enjoyment populations were in severe", "130:27", "decline and in danger of not being able", "130:30", "to provide food an adequate food source", "130:34", "for the people that lived and when I'm", "130:36", "talking people to live people live in", "130:38", "these remote areas yes they did and I've", "130:40", "seen the show yeah it's a lot more real", "130:43", "than those shows but they they live in", "130:44", "these areas where there is no access to", "130:46", "other food sources one of the guys that", "130:48", "I met the only thing he eats for an", "130:50", "entire year is bear meat he has no other", "130:54", "I mean I don't know if he gets some kind", "130:56", "of gross some kind of garden and forages", "130:58", "as well but his main food source through", "131:01", "the winter is bear meat which gun black", "131:03", "bear in that area yeah or brown or it", "131:06", "didn't matter whatever you could get so", "131:08", "there's people that live in certain", "131:09", "places that the only way that they live", "131:12", "is from the animals that live there and", "131:13", "that's the only way that could survive", "131:15", "I'd like to get a scientist to study", "131:16", "that guy yeah he was an interesting guy", "131:19", "I mean the guy who just eats bear what", "131:21", "is he like he's like ridiculously strong", "131:24", "what they get him the gift no you you", "131:27", "seem like it's normal as somebody that", "131:30", "lives off greed is yeah so they but", "131:36", "anyways this particular area the bear", "131:39", "population was so high that it was", "131:42", "severely hurting the undulant population", "131:46", "to the point where there might it would", "131:48", "be very hard to repair so then they open", "131:50", "up these special seasons like for people", "131:54", "to go in to hunt bears in this", "131:57", "particular area", "131:58", "with a certain objective and since they", "132:00", "opened it now that areas been starting", "132:02", "to recuperate and then they stopped the", "132:04", "predator management thing mmm they they", "132:06", "still you can hunt certain but they have", "132:08", "so we've got a interesting balance and", "132:11", "they they put a lot of time and research", "132:12", "and into this whole deal this home", "132:15", "there's something very bizarre about", "132:17", "those television shows because they're", "132:18", "they're captivating those people that", "132:21", "live off the grid yeah but there's", "132:22", "something really ironic about a person", "132:24", "who doesn't even have a television in", "132:27", "their house but they're on television", "132:29", "that is weird weird yeah you know this", "132:32", "guy is living as close to the land as", "132:34", "possible but yet
