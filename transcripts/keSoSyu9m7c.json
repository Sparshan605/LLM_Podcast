["00:07", "boom and we're live", "00:09", "alright dumb welcome to the show I'm", "00:11", "doing great Jeff let's start her ray up", "00:12", "close yeah there you go", "00:14", "I know you've done a podcast for you did", "00:16", "Tim Paris's podcast I heard you on that", "00:17", "I didn't like three of them I think I", "00:20", "did four three three really guys oh I", "00:23", "need to listen to the other two then um", "00:25", "what is this wine you brought me man", "00:26", "this is crazy that is you're taking a", "00:28", "drunk just what this is hi maybe the the", "00:31", "dry farm wines guys think that this is a", "00:34", "giant Magnum I'd have to have a party", "00:36", "it's uh it's a wine that's pretty legit", "00:39", "in regards to if you want to stay on a", "00:41", "ketogenic diet yeah and I tested this", "00:45", "and in my office actually and just found", "00:47", "that it to be it's non glycemic for one", "00:51", "thing which means it doesn't impact the", "00:53", "sugar content is so low there's not an", "00:55", "elevation and in blood glucose and I can", "00:59", "stain ketosis on this wine if I do one", "01:02", "glass two or three starts to kick me out", "01:05", "but two glasses of wine you can", "01:07", "completely say in ketosis interesting", "01:10", "most glasses most wine will kick you out", "01:13", "of ketosis uh yeah I mean it's highly", "01:16", "dependent on like a merlot you know a", "01:18", "dry wine typically doesn't but it's more", "01:21", "a little more dry most of it yeah that's", "01:24", "the time yeah white wines tend to kick", "01:26", "me out more and of course something like", "01:28", "a sweet wine will go Riesling or", "01:30", "something like that", "01:31", "really sweet yeah sangria you know", "01:34", "that's just sugar yeah and even beer", "01:36", "does even though it's supposed to be a", "01:38", "little card beer tends to kick me out", "01:39", "really and make a little ultra maybe one", "01:42", "you know one or two but other than that", "01:45", "yeah I mean I get that question a lot so", "01:48", "it actually got me interested into", "01:50", "studying this so I can answer some of", "01:51", "the questions with some level of", "01:54", "knowledge and after testing these wines", "01:57", "and I came to the conclusion yeah you", "02:00", "can drink two glasses of wine a day on a", "02:03", "strict ketogenic diet and I mean this is", "02:06", "important for you know people that are", "02:08", "doing it to manage their health", "02:09", "long-term right", "02:11", "and especially people with actual health", "02:13", "issues we're ketogenic diet benefits", "02:16", "them like yeah plastic absolutely like", "02:20", "when I got into this it was a pediatric", "02:22", "epilepsy like in two thousand seven or", "02:24", "eight and now the applications are", "02:26", "expanding you know a dozen or more so we", "02:30", "hold a conference in metabolic", "02:31", "therapeutics conference we're taught top", "02:33", "tier people in academia and like from", "02:36", "Johns Hopkins they're probably one of", "02:38", "the spearheaded ketogenic diet", "02:40", "application clinically and top tier", "02:43", "scientists like from Yale and Harvard", "02:45", "and other places present here and it's I", "02:49", "think the applicator is like 11 or 12", "02:51",

"everything from you know polycystic", "03:04", "ovary syndrome to acne to rare even", "03:08", "genetic disorders like Angelman syndrome", "03:11", "is something that we're saying it's a", "03:13", "it's a genetic disorder where a", "03:15", "housekeeping gene is mutated and it", "03:18", "results in seizures and motor function", "03:21", "impairment and the ketogenic diet is", "03:23", "remarkably effective not it's really", "03:26", "drug resistant seizures that these kids", "03:28", "have and even in the presence of a", "03:30", "persistent molecular pathology a genetic", "03:34", "pathology the ketogenic diet through", "03:37", "altering metabolism with the ketogenic", "03:38", "diet you can largely silence the the", "03:41", "pathology and the motor function", "03:42", "impairments associated with this disease", "03:44", "and that that's amazing to me that you", "03:47", "have a disease that is persistently", "03:50", "there due to a genetic mutation", "03:52", "and you can largely silence the symptoms", "03:55", "in the interest of addressing people", "03:57", "that are probably on the ground floor", "03:59", "and I feel like there's very few people", "04:00", "today that don't understand what a", "04:01", "ketogenic diet is but just in case for", "04:04", "people who don't know there are people", "04:06", "that use carbohydrates mainly for fuel", "04:09", "and then there is the ketogenic diet", "04:12", "which makes your body run on fats and", "04:14", "ketones so I just try to explain that to", "04:18", "people like how this came about how", "04:22", "people started", "04:24", "researching this and and how you got", "04:26", "involved okay I mean this goes back if", "04:30", "not centuries like millennia you know to", "04:33", "dating back to the time of Hippocrates", "04:34", "when it was observed that fasting was a", "04:37", "quote unquote cure for seizures and with", "04:40", "the observation yeah so fasting puts you", "04:42", "into fasting ketosis right so even", "04:45", "intermittent fasting like I do the", "04:47", "14-hour thing where 14 hours you know", "04:50", "that's that's clinical I mean", "04:52", "technically that's kind of I call that", "04:54", "semi a semi fasted state when you", "04:56", "achieve that you know when you're eating", "04:57", "breakfast it could be you know twelve", "04:59", "hours or more since you've eaten last", "05:01", "and you're breaking the fast essentially", "05:03", "but with severe epileptic patients it", "05:06", "was found that when you when they", "05:08", "restricted food and in some cases water", "05:11", "after about two or three days you had", "05:14", "profound seizure control or it silenced", "05:16", "even the worst seizures and this was", "05:19", "observed you know for millennia like I", "05:23", "said and the there was some work done in", "05:28", "the early 1900's and and 1920s there was", "05:32", "some work done at the Mayo Clinic that", "05:33", "that observed the presence of these", "05:35", "ketone bodies and people that were", "05:37", "eating a carbohydrate restricted diet", "05:39", "that was primarily based on eating fat", "05:42", "and with a minimal amount of protein", "05:45", "just enough to ensure there's not", "05:47", "protein you know malnutrition and it was", "05:50", "observed that there was an elevation of", "05:51", "ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and", "05:53", "acetyl acetate in the blood so they", "05:54", "called it a physiologist called that the", "05:57", "ketogenic diet even technically maybe", "06:00", "beta-hydroxybutyrate it's not a ketone", "06:02", "but physiologist called these ketone", "06:03", "bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate acetyl", "06:05", "acetate and acetone and it mimicked the", "06:08", "physiological state of fasting in many", "06:10", "ways so if you were to draw blood off", "06:13", "someone on a ketogenic diet it would", "06:15", "sort of look like they had been fasting", "06:17", "a few days because it's mimicking the", "06:21", "way I think about it it's suppressing", "06:22", "the hormone insulin and kind of", "06:24", "mimicking the fuel the substrate", "06:26", "utilization that you would be using in a", "06:29", "state of being fasted which is primarily", "06:31", "fats ketones and to a lesser extent", "06:36", "I mean a glucose from amino acids from", "06:39", "protein you are mobilizing some", "06:42", "gluconeogenic amino acids from your", "06:43", "skeletal muscle when you are fasting", "06:45", "ketones are protein sparing though so", "06:47", "they are anti catabolic in that way so", "06:49", "because we make ketones and our large", "06:51", "brain has a massive demand for energy", "06:53", "and the ketones fulfill that for the", "06:56", "most part when fasting it prevents us", "06:58", "from breaking down muscle it prevents us", "07:01", "from liberating the gluconeogenic amino", "07:04", "acids that would otherwise you know be", "07:06", "chewed up and used to maintain our", "07:08", "glucose levels so the ketones sort of", "07:10", "replace the glucose the brain has the", "07:12", "metabolic flexibility to adapt from", "07:14", "using glucose to using primarily ketone", "07:16", "bodies and those ketone bodies really", "07:18", "have a protein sparing anti catabolic", "07:21", "effect now is this an ancient system", "07:23", "that was in place back when people you", "07:25", "know obviously couldn't go to the store", "07:27", "and your diet varied depending upon what", "07:28", "was available and it just allowed people", "07:30", "like say like maybe Inuits that lived", "07:32", "off a lot of fats because they really", "07:34", "don't have many carbohydrates if you're", "07:36", "living off a whale blubber and things", "07:38", "along those lines like they had to back", "07:39", "then yeah I mean it's hardwired in in", "07:42", "humans and obviously and other animals", "07:44", "my my wife studies manta rays and and", "07:48", "they they're that they're that like the", "07:49", "Einsteins of the see that so they're the", "07:51", "fish with the biggest brains of all", "07:53", "animals and we've done metabolomic", "07:56", "Studies on them and looking at the blood", "07:58", "and they produce a significant amount of", "08:00", "ketones like two milli molar they dive", "08:02", "really deep so it may help protect them", "08:04", "from that so yeah animals will go into", "08:06", "ketosis during fasting or even if you", "08:09", "manipulate their food source the keto", "08:12", "pet sanctuary actually treats dogs that", "08:15", "have cancer and they implement a", "08:17", "ketogenic diet in dogs in addition to", "08:21", "some other things to help and many of", "08:25", "these are dogs taken from kill shelters", "08:26", "and and put them on an anti-cancer", "08:28", "therapy program now they can get into", "08:31", "ketosis for the most harder but not most", "08:34", "dog food is not ketogenic is like", "08:36", "documents of grain in it right yeah for", "08:38", "fillers and things on those lines yeah", "08:40", "it's really interesting I was talking", "08:42", "with Ron Penna yesterday from quest", "08:45", "nutrition the CEO of quest nutrition and", "08:47", "he brought to my attention that if you", "08:49", "look on a package of", "08:50", "food you won't see carbohydrates listed", "08:52", "even right it's the primary because", "08:54", "there was some some laws or policy put", "08:57", "into action to prevent carbohydrates", "08:59", "from even being listed on kibble on dog", "09:02", "food which I find if you know there's a", "09:05", "lot of reasons why", "09:06", "mostly because dogs really shouldn't be", "09:08", "eating in carbohydrate based diet and", "09:10", "it's probably part of the reason but", "09:12", "there's sort of other reasons why but", "09:15", "it's really important that is so the", "09:19", "food that the keto pet sanctuary gives", "09:21", "the dogs that have cancer and they", "09:23", "confirm that they have cancer with a", "09:25", "glucose PET scan and they do it you know", "09:27", "before during and after is basically", "09:30", "kind of like a raw foods ketogenic diet", "09:33", "that's almost completely restricted in", "09:36", "what we've called glycemic carbohydrates", "09:37", "things that would elevate the glucose", "09:39", "levels and it's very high in fat", "09:42", "relatively speaking", "09:43", "yeah but dogs you know really should not", "09:45", "be eating any kind of greens at all yeah", "09:48", "I feed my dog grain free dog food but I", "09:51", "don't know if it's carb free I don't", "09:53", "know what's in there", "09:54", "yeah its kibble it's not to find out", "09:57", "right yeah I mean you know dog food that", "10:00", "has like some peas and sweet potatoes", "10:04", "and things like that is okay but ideally", "10:07", "you know you want to give your dog like", "10:09", "a whole food nutrition just like humans", "10:12", "you know they say don't give your dog", "10:14", "human food but that's there's no", "10:17", "evidence for that and you know given", "10:19", "talks where I talked about giving dogs", "10:21", "raw food and there's a there'd be a", "10:23", "reaction from the audience well it's", "10:25", "dangerous to give your dog like raw food", "10:27", "well what are they in a wild you know I", "10:28", "mean if the if it's ground beef that's", "10:31", "been sitting around and a processing", "10:32", "plant for a while yeah maybe but fresh", "10:34", "you know meat from a butcher fresh meat", "10:38", "I mean it's probably the ideal thing for", "10:40", "a dog ideally organ meats like liver", "10:42", "heart kidneys things like that grind it", "10:45", "up you know and some some greens to sand", "10:49", "things like spinach you can buy like", "10:50", "spinach powder so the keto pet sanctuary", "10:52", "has an e-book that's completely free if", "10:55", "you go to keto pet sanctuary dot o-r-g i", "10:58", "believe and you can download its ebook", "11:01", "and it tell", "11:01", "very precisely how to make your dog food", "11:04", "not only to you know if your dog gets", "11:06", "cancer but to maximize its overall", "11:08", "performance and you are preventing", "11:11", "cancer by virtue of putting them on a", "11:13", "diet that optimizes your their metabolic", "11:15", "health but that's got to be very", "11:17", "difficult to package though and", "11:19", "something that's sort of evergreen sits", "11:21", "on the shelf and you know paper bag you", "11:24", "can rip open and just pour into a bowl", "11:25", "that's what everyone that's like this", "11:26", "convenience thing but there's a way to", "11:28", "do it and you know I know I know those", "11:31", "guys you know epigenetics Foundation", "11:34", "they are working they basically support", "11:38", "the Quito pet sanctuary and they're", "11:40", "working out not only the macronutrient", "11:42", "ratios that need to go into the food but", "11:44", "also the types of food and also being", "11:47", "able to package it in a way to", "11:48", "ultimately come up with a food that you", "11:51", "can go it may not be on the Shelf and", "11:53", "probably ideally shouldn't be on the", "11:54", "shelf but it'll be like in the", "11:55", "refrigerator section of your pet food", "11:57", "store so you go there and like for our", "12:00", "dogs we'd get like a tube of freshly", "12:03", "ground up steak or whatever and we feed", "12:06", "that we take you know the ground meat", "12:08", "and mix it with organ meat and mix it", "12:09", "with different greens like broccoli and", "12:12", "things like that and give it to them and", "12:14", "they love it with a little bit of", "12:15", "coconut oil on it sometimes so you would", "12:17", "go to the grocery store or it would be", "12:19", "could be shipped to your house and it's", "12:21", "basically kept you know refrigerated and", "12:23", "it has a the complement of like organ", "12:26", "meats to you know the proper types of", "12:29", "fats fish oil fats and fiber and and it", "12:34", "fits that macronutrient ratio of the", "12:35", "ketogenic diet the dog must have", "12:37", "horrific farts yeah one of them yeah we", "12:41", "have a Great Dane they're both rather", "12:42", "rescue dogs one of them does I'm here in", "12:46", "broccoli organ meats and coconut oil I'm", "12:49", "like whoa get out of the room yeah it's", "12:51", "either my wife or the dog they're", "12:59", "healthy how long have you been involved", "13:01", "in ketogenic research and research on", "13:04", "keto diets and and how long have you", "13:06", "been doing it yourself yeah I I guess it", "13:09", "was I got turned on to it in two", "13:11", "thousand seven or eight and actually I", "13:14", "was communicating", "13:15", "line on a nutrition form on a fitness", "13:18", "website and I was a neuroscientist I did", "13:21", "my PhD on cellular neuroscience I did", "13:25", "unless something called patch-clamp", "13:26", "electrophysiology where I electrically", "13:28", "record from neurons and it was you know", "13:30", "really mostly just neuroscience and my", "13:35", "postdoctoral research was studying", "13:36", "seizures and I got to the point where", "13:39", "we're doing some drug based research on", "13:41", "seizures and other types of research and", "13:43", "and the types of seizures that I study", "13:46", "are powerful tonic clonic seizures that", "13:48", "a Navy SEAL could potentially experience", "13:51", "using closed-circuit rebreather so when", "13:53", "they're underwater a limitation for", "13:55", "their time underwater is CNS oxygen", "13:57", "toxicity and it's also a limitation for", "14:00", "hyperbaric oxygen therapy", "14:01", "rebreathers are those ones that don't in", "14:03", "emit bubbles yeah yeah so there's a bit", "14:07", "of a stealth component so you're", "14:09", "underwater and if you're going over a", "14:11", "lake to engage the enemy they can't see", "14:14", "you coming so that's the advantage that", "14:16", "they're very stealth like the", "14:19", "disadvantage is at 50 feet of sea water", "14:21", "in just 10 minutes you have the", "14:23", "potential to get CNS oxygen toxicity of", "14:25", "course if you follow the guidelines and", "14:28", "dive within the guidelines of you know", "14:32", "the depth and the time then you're", "14:34", "typically okay 99.9 percent of the time", "14:36", "but if you have you know someone", "14:39", "shooting with a 50 caliber machine gun", "14:41", "into the water you're not going to want", "14:43", "to come up you know you're going to want", "14:45", "to stay down there if you have a mind to", "14:47", "go down to the bridge or ship or", "14:49", "something you have to likely in many", "14:50", "cases go down below 50 feet and it puts", "14:53", "you at the potential of having a seizure", "14:55", "and a seizure underwater the seizure", "14:57", "itself is not deadly per se but having a", "15:02", "seizure underwater could be fatal to the", "15:04", "mission and you know the warfighter so", "15:06", "my research was really developing", "15:09", "various technologies where we actually", "15:10", "put things inside a microscope inside a", "15:13", "hyperbaric chamber like an atomic force", "15:15", "microscope or a laser scanning confocal", "15:17", "or we can look at the mitochondria under", "15:20", "pressures that simulate these", "15:21", "operational conditions and and that was", "15:25", "about ten years ago and out of that", "15:26", "research evolved studying various", "15:29", "and looking at the cells and even the", "15:31", "mitochondria and observing that ketones", "15:33", "essentially enhance brain energy", "15:36", "production and resilience in extreme", "15:39", "environments of high pressure and high", "15:41", "oxygen and from those cellular studies I", "15:45", "became more interested in what people do", "15:48", "when drugs don't work for epilepsy and I", "15:51", "looked up and found the ketogenic diet", "15:52", "and this fits in perfect because my", "15:54", "background was studying nutrition and I", "15:57", "was studying pharmacology at the time", "15:58", "but it allowed me to bring nutrition", "16:00", "back into my research program and", "16:03", "studying the ketogenic diet specifically", "16:05", "and the the program officer at the time", "16:08", "at the office of Navy research really", "16:10", "liked the idea of the ketogenic diet in", "16:12", "a drug so being able to consume", "16:14", "something that can elevate these blood", "16:16", "ketone levels which can cross the", "16:18", "blood-brain barrier and make our brains", "16:20", "kind of super brains under physiological", "16:23", "extremes so that's what I really I put", "16:26", "my efforts into studying the ketogenic", "16:28", "diet and also into developing and", "16:30", "testing a wide range of exogenous ketone", "16:34", "products and which come which are on the", "16:38", "spectrum of drug like - on the spectrum", "16:40", "of kind of natural based things that can", "16:42", "be combined together that put you in a", "16:45", "state of therapeutic ketosis within like", "16:48", "30 minutes to 60 minutes so you can use", "16:51", "it right before an operation right for", "16:53", "mission or therapeutically so if you", "16:56", "have a child for example that has status", "16:58", "epilepticus which is continuous seizures", "17:00", "that you can't stop instead of giving", "17:02", "them an anti epilepsy drug that can have", "17:05", "side effects and even developmental", "17:07", "delays the ketogenic diet you know takes", "17:09", "24-48 maybe 72 hours to work but if you", "17:12", "can tube feed them a ketone supplement", "17:17", "and put them into therapeutic ketosis", "17:19", "then you can mitigate these seizures", "17:21", "which could have potential long-term", "17:23", "effects so that that's this one example", "17:26", "of a therapeutic application of", "17:28", "exogenous ketones but so you're doing", "17:30", "the research on this and you decided to", "17:31", "start doing it yourself yeah I started", "17:34", "doing it myself to get get a better", "17:36", "understanding actually the there was a", "17:38", "patient in in the UK his name is Mike", "17:41", "dancer and if you just kind of google", "17:42", "Mike dancer and epilepsy", "17:44", "you'll come up on his story which is a", "17:46", "really remarkable story because he tried", "17:48", "a dozen a half-dozen maybe even a dozen", "17:51", "different types of anti epileptic drugs", "17:53", "and high doses things like keppra like", "17:55", "things that are the standard of care and", "17:56", "it didn't work for him he connected with", "17:59", "me and I mentioned a couple supplements", "18:01", "before I embarked on the ketogenic diet", "18:03", "and long story short I gave him the", "18:05", "information kind of here's the ketogenic", "18:07", "diet here's a scientific rationale it", "18:09", "looks like before you go and have brain", "18:11", "surgery they were gonna remove part of", "18:12", "this hippocampus oh I said you know just", "18:15", "use this as it was maybe about two", "18:17", "thousand eight or nine ish and long", "18:21", "story short you know I didn't talk to", "18:22", "him cuz I got really

now I've got a", "26:12", "bunch of questions um first of all what", "26:15", "do you what are your primary fats like", "26:18", "when you when you tell someone that your", "26:20", "diet is I'm gonna forget about the", "26:22", "classic 90% fat but even at 75 percent", "26:25", "fat people just go Jesus like where", "26:26", "where's all that fat coming from like", "26:28", "woody what do you use her fats and you", "26:31", "vary it yeah my dad's pretty I get the", "26:36", "same 12 to 15 foods probably", "26:38", "pretty much every week my wife kind of", "26:40", "eats outside of the range at the", "26:41", "ketogenic diet so sometimes of dare she", "26:43", "yeah how dare she", "26:45", "I don't try to lost in front of you and", "26:47", "mock you uh she does but I don't crave", "26:50", "it so that's the thing I don't thinks", "26:53", "it's really strange don't you Italian I", "26:55", "am so that created a bit of a problem", "26:58", "with my family like when I go home yeah", "27:00", "oh yeah Mike carbohydrate tolerance is", "27:04", "actually really good so if I go back to", "27:05", "a higher carb diet you know I can't", "27:08", "throw in 3 400 grams of carbs a day but", "27:10", "I tolerate it very well so me going into", "27:13", "ketogenic diet was a very strange thing", "27:15", "for me to do that I had Reb Rob Wolf's", "27:19", "book and knew about the

I'd really thought", "27:34", "that you need carbs to grow in the gym", "27:36", "and maintain your strength", "27:37", "yeah and in performance and I just felt", "27:40", "that the brain needed

he's going yeah", "27:59", "with the classical ketogenic or the", "28:01", "modified Atkins but he has a problem", "28:03", "with like having the the carbohydrate", "28:06", "restriction when he has really hard", "28:08", "training days yeah I would too I've", "28:11", "talked to rob a little bit the body is", "28:13", "incredibly adaptable to switching fuel", "28:15", "sources and adapting to that fuel source", "28:18", "over time and some people may be a", "28:19", "little less adaptable than other people", "28:22", "but I think that if he was to give it", "28:25", "I think you know knowing Rob he did give", "28:27", "it a very legit shot he may benefit from", "28:29", "adding some slow carbs in just prior to", "28:32", "an intra workout you know during these", "28:35", "yams or some lunch", "28:36", "what do you consider a slow carb you", "28:38", "know there are supplements out there but", "28:40", "yeah if we're gonna talk about I would", "28:42", "say yeah maybe some a little bit of", "28:44", "sweet potato in you know prior to", "28:46", "training or the day before or maybe a", "28:48", "few hours before so it's some sort of a", "28:50", "car with", "28:51", "plenty of fiber something like yeah", "28:55", "digest slowly yeah even a high molecular", "28:58", "weight carbohydrates that are on the", "28:59", "market now like one of those you know I", "29:02", "don't use them anymore in a jiff Bullock", "29:04", "has a product out you can I think you", "29:07", "can starch is the name of it and it just", "29:10", "you know it will slightly elevate your", "29:14", "glucose and not trigger an insulin", "29:16", "response so you won't go hypoglycemic", "29:18", "after and it'll just you know", "29:20", "essentially you know titrating", "29:22",

"you know three or four hours which is", "29:34", "ideal for people engaging and you know", "29:37", "MMA or cycling during that during that", "29:40", "timeframe but I think I mean if you're", "29:42", "getting in a sufficient amount of", "29:44", "calories and if you are using things", "29:47", "like creatine monohydrate which knows or", "29:49", "you work through the phosphagen system",

the", "30:02", "supplement creatine would you do that", "30:04", "prior to the workout would like a lot I", "30:06", "know a lot of people take creatine", "30:07", "post-workout yeah I just you know if", "30:11", "you're taking creatine yeah and you", "30:13", "stopped taking creatine it's in your", "30:14", "system for you know a couple days to a", "30:16", "week or more so it's just you know on a", "30:18", "daily basis doesn't matter necessarily", "30:20", "when you take it is just that you take", "30:22", "it on and probably at least three grams", "30:24", "per day for a larger guy three to five", "30:27", "grams per day is that some you take it's", "30:29", "one of the few supplements that I take I", "30:32", "only take maybe three or four supplement", "30:34", "I used to take all these different", "30:35", "supplements so I'm more of a food guy", "30:38", "but maybe I take three or four", "30:40", "supplements and I use some of the new", "30:42", "food products that are coming out on the", "30:44", "market now accusing food products and", "30:47", "that allows me to maintain my catering", "30:48", "diet when I'm traveling okay do you ever", "30:50", "miss around beta alanine yeah it's", "30:53", "something I used to increase carnosine", "30:56", "levels right it's something that I used", "30:58", "in the past I don't like the tingles", "31:00", "that I get a lot of people like to take", "31:02", "a listen type 2000", "31:04", "it's not that extreme it's like niacin", "31:07", "but it's working right through a", "31:08", "different receptor yeah the first time I", "31:10", "took nice and I thought I was gonna die", "31:14", "unpleasant it's not something that I", "31:16", "know some people look forward to it and", "31:17", "I don't those people are strange but", "31:18", "it's not the big alanine is it makes me", "31:22", "uncomfortable but I remember drinking it", "31:24", "on the way to the gym it was it part of", "31:26", "my pre-workout formula and it just made", "31:29", "me itchy yeah I just didn't like it and", "31:32", "you know that the data's not it's a", "31:34", "little bit it's it's not I wouldn't it's", "31:36", "not what I would call compelling but it", "31:38", "looks like it may offer a benefit it was", "31:39", "just recommended to me that's why I held", "31:41", "it up so you creatine three grams per", "31:44", "day and what do you weigh out to 15", "31:46", "something like that what do you weigh", "31:47", "yeah on the mark yeah I lost some", "31:51", "waiters yeah almost exactly I had a", "31:55", "couple weeks ago I got down I did in a", "31:58", "mission with NASA and I was underwater", "32:00", "for a while and when it came back how", "32:02", "long as a while I was under for ten days", "32:04", "Jesus Christ that's more than a while", "32:06", "makes me an Aquanaut yeah Wow that's", "32:09", "crazy", "32:09", "so and during that time during the", "32:12", "training forage I was doing a lot of", "32:13", "swimming which was I sink like a rock", "32:15", "I'm kind of negatively buoyant it took a", "32:19", "lot out of me and I tried to get into my", "32:22", "file that I was then closer to 200 I", "32:24", "think maybe you'd be more likely to be", "32:26", "an astronaut candidate if you're like", "32:27", "lower you know his weight in space is a", "32:29", "big thing to me so I tried to get my", "32:31", "body weight from 226 down to 207 and I", "32:34", "did it took about three months and now", "32:35", "I'm creeping slowly back up and down and", "32:38", "what did you do that just high aerobic", "32:39", "workout yeah I did intermittent fasting", "32:43", "really just transitioned to a diet where", "32:46", "I typically do a ketogenic breakfast", "32:49", "that's kind of small and I would made", "32:51", "that a little bit smaller and two or", "32:53", "three days out of the week on average I", "32:56", "would just kind of not eat until dinner", "32:59", "and then I would eat a substantial", "33:01", "dinner and then maybe do some activity", "33:03", "after that and then kind of nibble at", "33:05", "night time I mean an hour or two before", "33:07", "bed and that was kind of my routine so", "33:09", "almost like a warrior diet type deal", "33:11", "pretty close to that yeah from what I", "33:13", "know that that's pretty close to that", "33:14", "and I did not in any way feel", "33:17", "deprived of food and that's really you", "33:20", "know people follow a low-carb diet or", "33:22", "ketogenic diet they think you don't have", "33:24", "to count macros which is like the", "33:25", "biggest mistake they think you just go", "33:27", "on this and you don't have to count", "33:28", "calories but you really do I mean you", "33:30", "could sit back you could sit down in", "33:31", "front of the TV with like a bag of", "33:33", "cashews and I can polish that off pretty", "33:35", "quick and you could do a lot of damage", "33:36", "like that's a lot of calories it depends", "33:39", "on the kind of foods that you're eating", "33:40", "two handfuls of almonds I think is like", "33:43", "500 calories or something yeah yeah", "33:45", "that's like yeah so I talked to people", "33:48", "who follow the kitchen diet and they're", "33:50", "like the catering diet doesn't work for", "33:52", "me I got on it and I gained like three", "33:54", "pounds and I was like well what was your", "33:55", "calories what was your macros oh I have", "33:57", "no idea I don't I was told I don't have", "33:59", "to count that yeah that's the most", "34:01", "important thing so this is the function", "34:03", "of the app I told you about avatar which", "34:06", "is kind of a macro counting program", "34:09", "right now you can set the adjustments to", "34:11", "do low-carb but the once the the", "34:14", "software is written up to for the keto", "34:17", "option that will be a tremendous", "34:20", "resource for people the average person", "34:22", "that wants to do the congenic diet and", "34:24", "hopefully we're going to craft it in a", "34:26", "way to to help the clinical community -", "34:29", "well that's one of the reasons why I", "34:30", "wanted to have you on is because you're", "34:32", "an actual scientist and this is there's", "34:34", "so many misconceptions when it comes to", "34:35", "ketogenic diet the benefits the problems", "34:38", "associated with it and and there's a", "34:40", "bunch of people that one of the things", "34:42", "that I found really fascinating is", "34:44", "recently because the ketogenic diets", "34:46", "become so popular there's been these", "34:49", "sort of sparsely educated meathead", "34:53", "trainer type dudes that are pooh-poohing", "34:55", "the ketogenic diet and whenever I see", "34:57", "that happen I go oh here's a person", "34:59", "whose ideas are threatened and you know", "35:02", "like whenever someone says the ketogenic", "35:03", "diet is not beneficial or it says this", "35:06", "is it's not really worth it I'm like", "35:07", "okay you're not saying anything like", "35:09", "where's the science like point to", "35:11", "something because there's a substantial", "35:14", "amount of science it shows the benefit", "35:15", "of the ketogenic diet but there's a lot", "35:18", "of meatheads that are there have been", "35:21", "critical of it and when I want to read", "35:22", "that I'm like okay there's you're not", "35:24", "saying anything like there's no", "35:26", "substantial reason why you're critical", "35:28", "of it this makes me think that you have", "35:30", "been", "35:30", "pushing a certain type of diet for a", "35:32", "long time this comes along it shows", "35:35", "contrary evidence and you're trying to", "35:37", "diminish it in

seen an", "36:42", "elite-level cyclist and and other types", "36:45", "of sports is that it really takes a", "36:48", "minimum of like three months I nearly", "36:50", "six months and even after a year I think", "36:53", "you're getting changes even at the", "36:56", "epigenetic level we know that ketones", "36:57", "function as a signaling molecule through", "37:01", "histone deacetylase

people about I", "40:19", "feel like nothing I'd be like I'm", "40:21", "telling you there was no difference I", "40:22", "mean I would eat a meal and go", "40:25", "throughout my day and then it'd be like", "40:26", "four o'clock in the afternoon I'm like", "40:27", "where's this crash and the crash is", "40:29", "supposed to be here like where's it", "40:30", "coming no crash yeah same thing with me", "40:33", "I mean looking back at in undergrad when", "40:35", "I was like tasks loaded with a lot of", "40:37", "classes and stuff I would make I was", "40:39", "trying to you know bulk up at the time", "40:40", "and I would I would put like steak or", "40:42", "beef on a bagel so I would cut a bagel", "40:44", "kind of in half and and then put like", "40:46", "meat and stuff so I would be getting all", "40:48", "the carbs from the bagel and I would", "40:49", "just go get a big Starbucks coffee cuz", "40:51", "then to to mitigate that crash right I", "40:54", "would have and now so the

much yeah", "60:15", "and I've I've never met her I think I", "60:17", "did measure that once and it wasn't but", "60:19", "people have reported to me that it was", "60:21", "the thing that showed up on my bloodwork", "60:23", "was lower I was on the low end of", "60:25", "magnesium and I was getting cramps at", "60:28", "the time and that's the only you asked", "60:29", "about side effects so the only side", "60:30", "effect that I experienced was cramps at", "60:33", "nighttime always between 3:00 and 4:00", "60:35", "in the morning and it would start in my", "60:36", "foot and then start to creep up to my", "60:38", "cab and or if I did like legs or", "60:42", "something sometimes my hamstrings and", "60:43", "then when I the magnesium", "60:45", "supplementation really prevented much of", "60:49", "that have you used an isolation tank", "60:51", "know one of the cool things about thanks", "60:54", "is that you get magnesium to the water", "60:57", "that's right and yeah because the waters", "60:59", "filled with salt and no I think there's", "61:03", "there's a pretty legit science behind", "61:07", "that I was traveling in in Israel and I", "61:11", "went to the Dead Sea

and Epsom", "61:37", "salt bath is you're talking about a very", "61:39", "small amount of Mebane salt in", "61:41", "comparison to a tank which has my tank", "61:43", "is a thousand pounds of epsom salts in", "61:46", "it and 11 inches of water so because", "61:48", "you're so boring you do this daily", "61:50", "hey no not daily but whenever I want", "61:53", "you know because it's in my basement", "61:54", "let's go down there and get into it but", "61:56", "it's the relaxing effects is pretty", "61:59", "profound", "61:59", "that's intrat you know what it brings to", "62:02", "mind most of the I've had at least a", "62:04", "half-dozen emails about doing Epsom salt", "62:07", "baths from ALS patients because ALS is", "62:11", "associated with a chemical called", "62:13",

can really feel", "63:01", "kind of a calming effect then has yeah", "63:04", "makes sense a lot of people like to take", "63:05", "it before they go to bed yep yeah but", "63:07", "the the tank is just when you get out of", "63:10", "there your whole body's feels relaxed I", "63:11", "mean I think part of is because the zero", "63:13", "gravity effect of floating and you", "63:15", "you're floating like you're it you're", "63:18", "very buoyant yeah in this because the", "63:20", "water is very heavier and like like the", "63:22", "Dead Sea like only a maybe a third of", "63:24", "your body is kind of floating in it", "63:25", "right half your body essentially like", "63:28", "your ears are underwater your face is", "63:30", "above water", "63:31", "it's amazing you got trying I'm a

"mix it up that's one problem with a", "67:38", "ketogenic if you mix it up and let it", "67:40", "sit then it's like tasted like battery", "67:42", "acid for a while but so I mix it up and", "67:44",

"67:52", "them are nasty", "67:53", "yeah well the ketone esters so these are", "67:56", "things that if I give you right now you", "67:58", "would gag you would not be able to drink", "68:00", "it yes somebody sent me some where's", "68:02", "that jazz", "68:03", "we still have that laying around here", "68:04", "that little thing at ketone esters and", "68:06", "some dudes sent it was in like a sealed", "68:07", "little foil sealed plastic thing I'd be", "68:15", "curious I know all the all the people", "68:17", "behind this", "68:23", "it was here somewhere", "68:25", "okay this place is a mess who knows um", "68:28", "so like if someone had a big bowl of", "68:29", "pasta and then they took something like", "68:32", "Key genex would that knock you back in", "68:34", "the state of ketosis yeah you could you", "68:36", "could eat a bowl of pasta and then", "68:38", "consume a key genex product and then", "68:40", "test your test your blood ketones and it", "68:43", "would look like you're on a strict", "68:44", "eugenic diet a mild like what I would", "68:46", "call modified Atkins diet whereas so the", "68:49", "key to an ester you could boil pasta and", "68:52", "then take a ketone ester and it would", "68:54", "look like you fasted for 10 days so it", "68:57", "puts you into starvation level ketosis", "68:59", "so interestingly another application of", "69:02", "ketones is that it lowers blood glucose", "69:04", "and we don't know why we're studying", "69:06", "that right now but and it may do it by", "69:09", "your livers like the main regulator of", "69:12", "what your glucose is so your liver has", "69:15", "glycogen in it and it's constantly being", "69:17", "broken down and kind of spilling glucose", "69:20", "into it maybe affecting that process or", "69:23", "it may be enhancing insulin sensitivity", "69:25", "which means you take ketones and your", "69:26", "cells use the glucose that there it", "69:30", "becomes more readily

replicated it", "69:40", "many times with different forms of", "69:41", "ketones so would that be a way for a", "69:43", "person who maybe is just not so good at", "69:46", "being disciplined their diet they just", "69:47", "throw it in there like said I kinda", "69:49", "wanted up some ice cream but I've been", "69:51", "really good with my diet", "69:52", "fuck it I'll just have the ice cream we", "69:53", "then have some key chanak's or something", "69:55", "like that afterwards well I firmly", "69:57", "believe there's no shortcuts", "69:58", "like and I think of ketones and I tried", "70:01", "I think I mentioned this on Tim Ferriss", "70:02", "too and he put it in there that ketones", "70:05", "are just another source of energy so if", "70:07", "you have if you're eating 2,000 calories", "70:09", "of food and then taking lots of ketone", "70:11", "supplements you are eating a lot more", "70:13", "than 2,000 calories food because as far", "70:15", "as fat but it might as far as like", "70:17", "gaining weight but the bar is like", "70:18", "keeping your body into a state of", "70:20", "ketosis yeah it actually does work", "70:21", "absolutely and the benefits that would", "70:24", "be maybe not weight loss but by", "70:28", "elevating your blood ketone levels", "70:31", "there's a lot of beneficial effects even", "70:34", "from a signalling standpoint like", "70:36",

"79:40", "you're studying this so deeply like have", "79:42", "you ever contemplated like what is the", "79:44", "root cause like why are we so good at", "79:46", "burning fats why is it so

can see this by a patient", "82:49", "a type one diabetes patient for example", "82:51", "who goes from eating a high carbohydrate", "82:53", "diet to a ketogenic diet where their Dex", "82:56", "con

high is", "83:05", "there's way few highs and way few lows", "83:08", "and it's within a tight range and there", "83:10", "they stay within the range where they're", "83:12", "optimized I would say so

we're", "84:57", "gonna we're gonna pull over and I", "84:59", "remember feeling that way too and I", "85:01", "would kind of go off the wagon I need a", "85:02", "half of a box of Tollhouse cookies but", "85:06", "yesterday I three packets of something", "85:08", "called keto cookies and I put some in", "85:11", "your your little gift bag there yeah and", "85:14", "these keto cookies I just I

mean I see from the general", "95:37", "consumer point of view like I could see", "95:39", "maybe but once they know the science", "95:42", "behind it like the CEO sent me a stack", "95:45", "of research papers and are all off of", "95:47", "PubMed and I started looking through", "95:49", "them and then double-checking on PubMed", "95:51", "and realizing there's a lot of science", "95:53",

um this keto ice cream company", "98:38", "what's it called again yeah actually", "98:40", "there's not a company that I know of yet", "98:42", "it's just I told them they need to", "98:46", "create some IP around this this formula", "98:47", "but uh it was that the the Institute for", "98:50", "human and machine cognition that the", "98:52", "shuttle there himself", "98:54", "yeah he has a number of recipes because", "98:56", "the CEO there Ken Ford I mean he's a", "99:00", "huge fan of the ketogenic diet and how I", "99:03", "got hooked up with him because he", "99:05", "realizes that

create these ketogenic", "99:45", "recipes that are like ultra gourmet and", "99:48", "amazing to eat what about pasta is there", "99:50", "like an almond flour based pasta not", "99:53", "that I've you know I've tried a lot of", "99:55", "things but I would hesitate to recommend", "99:58", "anything just because I have not been", "99:59", "impressed enough to to really there's", "100:02", "some

you", "100:18", "know every we have a certain threshold", "100:19", "for soluble fiber which gets broken down", "100:21", "into butyrate and other things in the", "100:23", "gut and if you exceed that you just", "100:26", "become you know a gas machine and so", "100:28", "maybe it would be good in like a small", "100:29", "side dish yeah yeah so that's your", "100:34", "weakness N+ an ice cream - oh no I mean", "100:37", "I can go without ice cream I'm fine", "100:38", "sweets really don't get me that much I", "100:40", "mean it's not that big of a deal so it's", "100:42", "not something like

just stop taking it for a long", "100:57", "time stop eating it for a long time but", "100:59", "that's been my cheap food for a while", "101:00", "yeah so if I just cut it out of my", "101:03", "system completely for like six months or", "101:05", "something like that I probably you know", "101:06", "if you there's a book that has ice cream", "101:10", "there's a recipe Jeff Bullock has a book", "101:12", "it's called the art and science of low", "101:13", "carbohydrate performance and this will", "101:15", "appeal to your crowd because a lot of", "101:17", "MMA guys I refer the book

rest", "101:28", "I know there's an ice cream recipe in", "101:31", "there that's not unlike the recipe I was", "101:33", "just talking about so but the pasta", "101:36", "thing yeah that would be weak if someone", "101:39", "can nail that down that would be pretty", "101:41", "good yes yeah we filled with some weird", "101:45", "stuff that make you adjust in Italy yeah", "101:47", "right I saw the pictures whereabouts and", "101:50", "did you have pasta and pizza when I went", "101:51", "off like a rocket I do that and when I", "101:56", "was in Naples I gotta have pizza it was", "101:58", "quite a while ago but you know it's", "102:00", "moderation too well they also have", "102:02", "different flour and I talked to yeah", "102:04", "they do that's right Maynard Maynard", "102:06", "Keenan from the band tool also has an", "102:10", "Austria a restaurant and a vineyard that", "102:13", "he runs in Arizona weird guy but he", "102:17", "explained on the past on the podcast", "102:19", "rather but I did with him recently the", "102:21", "difference between the pasta that we", "102:24", "have today in the bread we have today", "102:25", "and original heirloom wheat which is", "102:28", "less it's lower yield per acre and it", "102:32", "has less complex glutens in it", "102:34", "and he's like that is what when people", "102:36", "are talking about like the difference", "102:38", "between how your body tolerates like", "102:40", "certain gluten whether it's gluten", "102:41", "sensitivity or not he's like just it's", "102:44", "just a different feel and I really", "102:46", "noticed that when I was in Italy like", "102:48", "when I would eat their pasta I mean it", "102:51", "just it tastes different it feels", "102:52", "different when it's going down and I", "102:54", "actually ordered a bunch of it from from", "102:57", "Italy and I even cooked it at home and I", "102:59", "noticed the difference and did you get", "103:02", "any you don't have any so if I go which", "103:05", "I don't okay if I go to the movie", "103:07", "sometimes I'll get popcorn and I'm", "103:08", "completely okay like eating popcorn and", "103:10", "you know a day or two later and back", "103:12", "into ketosis really fast without even", "103:14", "excited as ketones but if I do eat pizza", "103:17", "or pasta which I did in the beginning", "103:20", "when

"103:38", "I did go to Italy and we travel around", "103:41", "all over", "103:41", "it's my wife you know loves to travel", "103:43", "and we were in Naples and I ate maybe", "103:46", "two or three pieces of the pizza I had", "103:47", "absolutely no problems whereas that in", "103:49", "the u.s. that would have bothered me and", "103:51", "maybe it was just it may have been the", "103:54", "flour I guarantee you the flour it's", "103:56", "it's just a different kind of flour I", "103:57", "think what they call it's called double", "103:59", "O flour see if you can find that Jamie", "104:01", "the flour that they use and they'll", "104:03", "specify for imported wheat flour from", "104:07", "Italy that it's a special type of flour", "104:09", "and that that flour is essentially", "104:11", "heirloom flour so the difference between", "104:12", "like when you buy a tomato from the", "104:15", "grocery store and it's pale and", "104:17", "bulletproof and you can throw it down a", "104:19", "flight of stairs and it doesn't even get", "104:20", "bruised versus heirloom tomatoes which", "104:23", "are almost like a fruit me really is", "104:24", "essentially a fruit yeah and

one that had", "104:38", "their bride a mint somewhere got it", "104:41", "yeah I don't know man I mean that's my", "104:43", "that's my big problem but if I if", "104:47", "someone does do that they say if they", "104:48", "follow a ketogenic diet and they eat a", "104:52", "bowl of pasta that I can't help it and", "104:53", "then they take exogenous ketones and it", "104:57", "knocks them back

"something that's diet yep so just if you", "119:56", "google like ketogenic diet in a Google", "119:58", "search around 2012 it's down here and", "120:01", "something happened around two thousand", "120:03", "thirteen or fourteen or just skyrocketed", "120:05", "what was that you know i have no idea i", "120:07", "mean i was on Tim Ferriss and and other", "120:09", "things but a lot of my

so many mumble well you", "120:23", "know I'm sure you colleagues have a lot", "120:24", "to do with it but as far as like the", "120:26", "impact of the things are something a", "120:27", "podcast the impact that a podcast has in", "120:30", "terms of like the amount of people that", "120:32", "are coming right Google something that's", "120:33", "probably yeah", "120:34", "many many magnitudes

going back", "142:56", "like 2009 as recently yeah it was really", "143:01", "bizarre to them that someone would", "143:03", "actually follow the ketogenic diet and I", "143:05", "was doing like the

and then I get you", "146:41", "know a pretty good chunk of the time", "146:43", "fasting and then after I'm done with", "146:47", "work you know I'm not frantically", "146:48", "running around trying to get stuff done", "146:49", "so I can relax you know with my wife and", "146:51", "just kind of kick back and eat and just", "146:53", "you know and that's kind of what I want", "146:55", "to eat anyway so you feel like this is", "146:57", "more of a better I'm doing a 14-hour", "146:59", "thing you think is even more benefit", "147:00", "doing an 18 I do I think you and you", "147:04", "know I don't I do I effort for me I", "147:08", "definitely think I do because there's", "147:11", "something about like a couple hours", "147:14", "extra where like if I fast for 14 hours", "147:18", "but then go like my ketones really start", "147:22", "to go out from 14 to 18 hours and then", "147:24", "and then I could actually stand ketosis", "147:26", "if I eat ketogenic during that six hours", "147:29", "of eating in my kind of pay attention to", "147:32", "you know eating really low carb like I", "147:35", "can eat and before I go to bed test my", "147:37", "ketones and bam I'm hitting like 2.2 or", "147:39", "something so I continue to get the", "147:41", "benefits of having ketones but when it", "147:44", "comes to like things like Ronda talks", "147:46", "about like Auto Fuji I think you can", "147:48", "even get more benefits within 18 hour", "147:50", "fast and you do that and you'll have to", "147:52", "do it every day I think you could just", "147:53", "do it like you could actually do it just", "147:55", "like once maybe twice a week and get a", "147:57", "lot of benefits from that like if you do", "147:59", "that over the core", "148:00", "of the year and that's not hard to do", "148:01", "mm-hmm right if you could just convince", "148:03", "people hey take the breads and pastas", "148:05", "out and just put in more vegetables and", "148:07", "just do intermittent fasting you know", "148:10", "every every Tuesday and Thursday and if", "148:13", "they do bloodwork after like three", "148:15", "months they're gonna see a profound", "148:17", "effect probably not even changing the", "148:18", "diet there they're gonna see a profound", "148:20", "effect now is the someone told me that", "148:23", "there is an effective way to measure", "148:24", "ketones through breathing there's some", "148:26", "sort of a breath monitor", "148:28", "yeah is that riolearn yeah there's a", "148:30", "couple out some of them were being", "148:32", "showcased at the conference out with", "148:34", "that the low carb USA the one that I", "148:38", "have the most experience with is a", "148:40", "product called ketone --ax and now they", "148:43", "have a

pretty color you know the kids like it", "150:01", "and everything it is kind of hard to", "150:03", "like set it up you got to calibrate it", "150:05", "and so it's a little bit clunky to work",

semi-quantitative", "150:18", "so they need to work out some of the", "150:20", "bugs and if you just look up breath", "150:22", "acetone meters there's probably about", "150:24", "five on the market

pretty good that but in your", "150:44", "blood is the best but the gold standard", "150:46", "probably will always be there's a", "150:48", "technologies emerging out now at least", "150:51", "you
