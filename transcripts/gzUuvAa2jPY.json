"single-player what is unique about our", "07:59", "single-player is that it will give you", "08:01", "the same buzz that a multiplayer will", "08:02", "give you because your opponents this", "08:04", "time are the AI and that opening level", "08:06", "that's white belts you're messing with", "08:08", "like easy dudes the later on it will", "08:11", "continue to level up and as you saw like", "08:13", "that guy that comes out with the axe", "08:14", "like again he is he is as tough as you", "08:16", "are so you will get the same feeling", "08:19", "from the single player that you do from", "08:20", "a multiplayer that's not really possible", "08:21", "it's because when I like this duels I", "08:23", "like like like in quake champions I like", "08:26", "playing duels you know that's what's fun", "08:28", "for me like one-on-one like me and Jaime", "08:30", "would get barbecued and we'd come here", "08:32", "and we play for hours just one-on-one", "08:34", "you run around the map and collect your", "08:37", "rocket launchers and your ammo and armor", "08:40", "and shit and just fuck each other up we", "08:42", "have a multiplayer called battle mode", "08:44", "that is fucking awesome like it's really", "08:46", "really good and then is it like quake", "08:48", "multiplayer like no no it's it's", "08:50", "different it's very unique", "08:52", "the last multiplayer we made was not", "08:54", "super well-received it was a really", "08:56", "competent good multiplayer but it was", "08:58", "that I was just doomed 2016's", "09:00", "multiplayer experience but it really", "09:02", "wasn't innovative enough like fans", "09:03", "wanted to see us like do something new", "09:05", "so we basically took the single-player", "09:07", "experience that combat loop that you'll", "09:09", "master and then we we give you a way to", "09:11", "do it with your friends it's a 2v1 so to", "09:13", "be you know two of you guys versus one", "09:15", "guy gets to be the Slayer with all the", "09:16", "guns and it's really really cool and", "09:18", "then there's invasion", "09:18", "so like you'll play the single-player", "09:20", "campaign and then someone can become a", "09:23", "demon like Jamie could become a demon", "09:24", "and then invade you while you're playing", "09:26", "you won't know where he is and it'll", "09:27", "just come out and try to fuck with you", "09:29", "mmm like it's really cool but is there", "09:31", "any one-on-one multiplayer invasions", "09:33", "kind of one-on-one but battle mode the", "09:35", "closest we come to the one-on-one is 2v1", "09:37", "oh okay that's weird", "09:39", "why'd you side two versus one instead of", "09:41", "one versus one it's just unique you know", "09:44", "it's it's the balance there no one demon", "09:47", "can stand against the Slayer you know", "09:48", "the doom guy is all-powerful he's got", "09:50", "all these you know he's right here he's", "09:52", "got all the guns and the mods and he's", "09:54", "got eight", "09:55", "his bicep exposed it seems like a", "09:57", "vulnerability okay it's like that kind", "09:59", "of calm", "10:00", "pretty much if someone comes along cuts", "10:02", "his fucking arm off it seems like that's", "10:04", "a good spot to hit his arms are like", "10:05", "trees so like that they're made of jelly", "10:08", "doughnuts they're very they are so big", "10:11", "that in one scene he raises like a sword", "10:13", "and the bicep just like is it's absurdly", "10:15", "huge but but um that's cute but it's", "10:18", "still made out of meat that's true", "10:20", "that's true", "10:21", "the the I forgot what I was saying but", "10:23", "yes you think you can compete battle", "10:26", "mode is really good you really like it", "10:27", "yeah but why don't you have a one-on-one", "10:29", "because we just it didn't it just didn't", "10:33", "work out that way I think do you", "10:34", "anticipate anything like that in the", "10:35", "future like you never know like", "10:38", "certainly we'll see but but we're really", "10:41", "really proud of this like I think what", "10:42", "you want to do is you you got to", "10:44", "innovate if if you want to make", "10:46", "something that's really going to engage", "10:47", "people like that like the whole point is", "10:50", "to like give them something to master", "10:52", "that they've never seen before because", "10:53", "if you're just asking me to master a new", "10:55", "version of a thing that I already", "10:56", "mastered sure a lot of people would", "10:58", "appreciate that but you're not really", "10:59", "going to capture like a large audience", "11:00", "so we really created something that was", "11:02", "completely unique and so we're excited", "11:05", "that now is there gonna be a deathmatch", "11:07", "mode where like all of us can get in a", "11:09", "room and fuck each other up I know we we", "11:14", "have quick champions for that I know but", "11:16", "we already played quick champions I", "11:18", "won't play that I'm gonna use those", "11:20", "weapons well with that guy like this is", "11:22", "this the multiplayer this is the", "11:24", "multiplayer Jesus Christ looks crazy it", "11:26", "is nuts", "11:27", "that dude you the it's its kind of bait", "11:29", "based on a couple of core pillars of", "11:31", "like we needed something that had a lot", "11:32", "of drama we wanted something that I had", "11:34", "a lot of pacing like the variations and", "11:36", "pacing in the match and something with", "11:38", "deep strategy so and and was primarily", "11:41", "innovative like unlike anything any", "11:42", "anything anybody had played before and", "11:44", "was from like it's a multiplayer for", "11:46", "people who love doom eternal so I'll", "11:48", "play the doom eternal single-player", "11:50", "you'll you'll like this right it looks", "11:52", "so incredible it's it's fucking awesome", "11:54", "the graphics are

numbers coming out of them those are", "12:10", "the other guys now I don't think most", "12:13", "people understand the incredible amount", "12:15", "of work that's involved in creating one",
