hate me see that right", "36:20", "yeah yeah I've done I've actually done a", "36:23", "lot of work to get away from using", "36:25", "buffers because of that and I'm still", "36:27", "like doing great work I just I have a", "36:29", "lot of friends who just they'll never", "36:31", "touch a fucking buffer and because it's", "36:33", "just terrifying it's scary what does it", "36:35", "look like for pigs i don't ii put up", "36:37", "like what would you call it maybe shine", "36:39", "like a a buffing shit i don't know", "36:43", "usually it's like usually it's like a", "36:45",

that", "37:06", "one is is what's called a sisal wheel so", "37:08", "it's it's made from a type that type of", "37:10", "rope but the ones that are the most", "37:12", "dangerous are the softer

"40:58", "braid and it's something I've been", "40:59", "wanting to create and finally figured", "41:03", "out so essentially what to create", "41:06", "pattern-welded Damascus", "41:08", "first off Damascus is kind of a blanket", "41:11", "has become a blanket term traditionally", "41:13", "and originally it actually referred to", "41:15", "the steel that like thick type of steel", "41:17",

"41:28", "it's it curls naturally or if it's kind", "41:31", "of forced and created the way that braid", "41:33", "pattern was made", "41:35", "so that's pattern welded steel so you", "41:37", "have to start with at least two", "41:39", "different types of high carbon steel", "41:41", "ideally Steel's that heat treat in a", "41:45", "similar range when you heat them up and", "41:47", "squish on them they they move at a", "41:49", "similar rate and so most commonly people", "41:52", "are working with ten eighty and 15 and", "41:54", "20 those are just codes for two", "41:57", "different types of high carbon steel but", "41:58", "essentially you bring them up to a high", "42:00", "temperature you you squish them either", "42:04", "under a big hammer or under a press you", "42:06", "can even actually do it by hand but you", "42:08", "have to do kind of a smaller billet to", "42:11", "create the patterns and get it to stick", "42:12", "because the trick is really getting", "42:14", "getting them close even evenly squishing", "42:18", "it out and it's like if you've ever like", "42:20", "rolled out dough or anybody who's never", "42:23", "made like pastry dough like you would", "42:25", "use in a croissant you tear open a", "42:27", "croissant you see all those layers in", "42:28", "there and that's from a piece of dough", "42:31", "being rolled out full it'll rolled out", "42:32", "and so it's kind of the same fucking", "42:34", "thing but with metal but you have to", "42:36", "have the kind of the right kind of", "42:39", "temperature environment kind of you you", "42:43", "want as little oxygen in there as", "42:45", "possible because the oxygen creates", "42:47", "carbon or not carbon but iron oxide that", "42:51", "help kind of is detrimental to creating", "42:54", "solid weld bonds and there are different", "42:56", "ways to achieve that but once the 1080", "43:00", "is the black steel the black color and", "43:02", "the 15 and 20 is the is the silver color", "43:05", "and then what's the difference in the", "43:06", "way those Steel's perform harder or more", "43:09", "durable they pretty much an edge more", "43:11", "they pretty much form perform almost", "43:13", "exactly the same they're they're in fact", "43:16", "chemically speaking they're almost", "43:17", "exactly the same except for the 15 and", "43:20", "20 has a high level of nickel in it 0.2", "43:24", "percent by volume or by weight and so", "43:28", "that steel is traditionally used in saw", "43:30", "blades especially large big mill band", "43:34", "saws you know like an organ there's like", "43:37", "one of the oldest and continuously", "43:39", "running a wood saw mill is still there", "43:42", "and doing its thing with these giant", "43:45", "bandsaw blades that are like", "43:47", "30 feet and I are in circumference and", "43:50", "they're like foot wide and there's", "43:53", "monsters and foot wide you mean like", "43:56", "thick no no no like they're only like", "43:59", "maybe a sixteenth of an inch thick", "44:00", "because you want a narrow soccer so", "44:03", "you're not wasting material but they're", "44:05", "why to help out of it okay flexion so", "44:08", "the bandsaw I'm thinking of a circular", "44:10", "saw for some reason sorry yeah bandsaw", "44:12", "so the circular saw those saw kerf SAR", "44:15", "usually probably around Ethernet H to a", "44:18", "quarter of an inch thick but it's the", "44:20", "same kind of idea is that they're", "44:22", "trimming down these giant logs so they", "44:25", "mind a big fucking saw so whether it's a", "44:27", "grind and break man it must be a fucking", "44:30", "nightmare yeah you don't want to be", "44:32", "standing right there when have you seen", "44:34", "an original samurai sword I've seen a", "44:37", "few actually this one's from the 1500s", "44:39", "check this shit out that's it oh shit", "44:42", "this is the one that I'm mister and Neil", "44:44", "deGrasse Tyson was closing what the", "44:46", "other day yeah that's an actual real", "44:52", "samurai sword right right from the 1500s", "44:55", "let's see the race skin is nice yeah do", "44:58", "you know when it was made exactly I", "45:01", "don't think they know they just know", "45:03", "it's from some time period in the 1500s", "45:05", "but there's a certificate of", "45:08", "authentication they came with it", "45:10", "explains I'm just looking to see what", "45:14", "the hormone activity thing so the", "45:17", "hormone is you can kind of see this line", "45:21", "that runs parallel to the cutting edge", "45:24", "and that usually indicates where the", "45:28", "soft material stops and the hard", "45:31", "material starts and so the idea with", "45:34", "these kind of the challenge with any", "45:36", "knife is making a knife that takes and", "45:40", "holds a sharp edge right for a good", "45:43", "period of time what's the key to that", "45:45", "but is also tough which means like you", "45:48", "can drop it and dry on a break so I give", "45:51", "you one of the hunting knife or", "45:52", "something like that", "45:52", "so a hunting knife that's commotion I", "45:55", "blow away knives those are harder", "45:57", "working knives so you want to actually", "45:59", "bring that hardness down you don't have", "46:01", "to bring it down a ton but just a few", "46:03", "points will make a huge fucking", "46:05", "difference look how's Mike here yeah", "46:07", "exactly what's the difference in the way", "46:08", "that knife is made and this knife is so", "46:10", "they were tempered they were heat", "46:12", "treated the same so they were brought up", "46:14", "to like 1500 degrees for people don't", "46:17", "not listening not watching this one of", "46:20", "these knives is a hunting knife that how", "46:23", "does that feel by the way it's great man", "46:25", "I love it", "46:26", "yeah but it's it's made very similarly", "46:31", "if you look into the the video of it", "46:34", "the handle is the same and it looks it", "46:36", "looks very similar it has a different", "46:38", "knife guard though it's pretty cool oh", "46:43", "yeah the guard keeps yet keeps your hand", "46:46", "from sliding up yeah I like that we made", "46:48", "the handle too it's an interesting", "46:50", "handle curved and everything yeah", "46:52", "where'd you get that pattern for like", "46:54", "yeah so I'm sorry to the first question", "46:57", "I'm sorry I remember like what is the", "47:00", "difference okay yeah yeah so they were", "47:02", "hardened so the heat treating the whole", "47:04", "process is essentially heating up the", "47:07", "steel make it hard and then you put it", "47:10", "back into heat but a low much lower", "47:12", "temperature to kind of toughen it up mmm", "47:15", "and so you're pulling some of that", "47:17", "hardness back so they were hardened the", "47:20", "same way but they were tempered at", "47:22", "different temperatures because one is a", "47:24", "hard used knife while the chef's knife", "47:26", "is not a hard use what is the difference", "47:27", "between temper and what like what does", "47:30", "that mean so the tempering so", "47:32", "essentially so I hardened it so I bring", "47:35", "it up to 1,500 degrees which is like a", "47:37", "dull glowing orange color and then I dip", "47:43", "it in a special oil that I have that's", "47:45", "designed for quenching materials not", "47:48", "just in knife making but all kinds of", "47:50", "different industrial applications", "47:52", "punching materials oil", "47:53", "sorry quenching oil what does that mean", "47:55", "so that's cooling the this hot steel", "47:58", "down in a very short period of time and", "48:00", "you wenching it oil so is it a cold oil", "48:03", "no so actually the depending on how the", "48:06", "steel needs to be heat treated you", "48:08", "actually want to heat up the oil so that", "48:11", "it's", "48:12", "it's thinner and it also there's this", "48:15", "thing that's called a vapor jacket so if", "48:17", "you've ever like been next to a", "48:19", "wood-burning stove and you drop a little", "48:21", "water on it and you see that bead water", "48:23", "dance around on there the same thing", "48:26", "happens on the surface of the blade", "48:27", "except for the blade is the source of", "48:29", "the heat right you put it in that oil", "48:31", "all that oil is dancing around on it", "48:34", "so when that's the oils thinner it it's", "48:38", "not as large of a jacket because when", "48:40", "that jacket is large so Jack in encasing", "48:44", "that steel while it's trying to cool", "48:45", "down it actually kind of acts as an", "48:48", "insulator and ruin or could potentially", "48:51", "ruin so not only do you put it in the", "48:53", "oil but you want to agitate it to kind", "48:55", "of break up that jacket so it doesn't", "48:58", "get a chance to just sit there all the", "49:01", "way around the blade and if it was cold", "49:03", "it would it would be thicker and so it", "49:08", "would make a larger jacket actually and", "49:10", "also the it probably wouldn't be as", "49:13", "efficient I guess in cooling the steel", "49:16", "down because ideally like for most", "49:18", "Steel's you want to cool them down", "49:20", "pretty much as quickly as you possibly", "49:21", "can so these have sorry so we keep going", "49:25", "I was gonna say you you essentially have", "49:27", "depending on what kind of Steel you're", "49:29", "working with you have anywhere from half", "49:31", "a second to like five seconds to get it", "49:36", "from 1500 degrees or sometimes higher to", "49:39", "below 800 degrees and so this knife", "49:44", "would be more durable durable yeah", "49:47", "tougher so in in knife making commonly", "49:51", "refer to it as being tougher so it can", "49:53", "withstand coming into impact with bone", "49:55", "you could chop with that thing a lot", "49:58", "more efficiently with a tougher knife", "50:00", "because this hasn't been tempered at it", "50:02", "as as high of a temperature it's it's", "50:06", "much harder than this one even though", "50:09", "it's a few points those few points make", "50:10", "a big difference and so if you were to", "50:12", "take this out into the woods try to do", "50:14", "the same job as this one just snap the", "50:15", "cutting it it wouldn't necessarily snap", "50:17", "but parts the cutting edge would blow", "50:21", "out probably blowing chips I actually", "50:24", "recently just", "50:25", "from time to time it's good practice as", "50:27", "a knife maker to make sure you that", "50:30", "you're still doing your thing every your", "50:31", "heat-treating stuff all right I take a", "50:33", "knife and I just beat the shit out of it", "50:34", "first I chop through some wood and then", "50:36", "I actually took it to an antler and beat", "50:37", "the shit out of it too and it's it is", "50:42", "amazing that if you're doing things", "50:44", "right you know ten thousandths of an", "50:47", "inch is enough to really to withstand", "50:50", "impact of chopping through wood pretty", "50:52", "well of course unless you're coming into", "50:54", "contact with like super yeah nail or", "50:57", "super dense knots that's crazy because", "50:59", "it's so thin right it's one that's", "51:02", "actually at least especially along the", "51:05", "cutting edge", "51:06", "that's probably twice as thick as it", "51:08", "actually needs to be Wow which is crazy", "51:11", "but it just it comes down to the", "51:13", "material mm-hmm not everybody are a lot", "51:15", "of people mistakenly think you know", "51:17", "steal a steal a steal a steal or", "51:19", "whatever but they're not steel is made", "51:21", "for many different applications and", "51:24", "they're actually very specifically", "51:25", "designed for those applications so like", "51:29", "a structural steel this kind of stuff", "51:30", "that you know buildings are built out of", "51:32", "very different from this it doesn't have", "51:34", "very much carbon in it at all that way", "51:37", "so the carbon is what helps make these", "51:40", "really hard so lacking that carbon it", "51:44", "allows it to be way tougher so you can", "51:47", "bend it all fucking day long so now", "51:49", "exactly right so that's why you want it", "51:51", "for buildings in LA where the", "51:52", "earthquakes hit they wiggle a little bit", "51:54", "yeah yeah this is much thinner than a", "51:59", "lot of other hunting knives would be", "52:03", "which is interesting you know with your", "52:06", "use of this exotic metal and now your", "52:09", "methods you're able to do that well and", "52:13", "also part of the reason that you're able", "52:14", "to do that is because it's high carbon", "52:16", "steel it has a which means it has a high", "52:19", "volume of carbon comparatively then", "52:23", "other kind of kinds of tool or cutlery", "52:25", "steel what's the benefit of high carbon", "52:27", "versus carbon so high carbon allows you", "52:31", "to especially for the the meteorites", "52:34", "deal it's it's a kind of crucible steel", "52:36", "called whoot", "52:37", "and so the patterning you've seen there", "52:39", "is actually strands of carbon or carbide", "52:44", "material so all the extra carbon", "52:48", "floating around in the matrix the iron", "52:50", "matrix of this steel jumps on to these", "52:54", "bands called carbides and there are", "52:56", "different elements and vanadium is one", "52:58", "of the elements in this steel that draws", "53:01", "those carbon that carbon in so what", "53:03", "you're seeing are thousands and", "53:05", "thousands of all these ultra hard carbon", "53:09", "bands floating around through the iron", "53:11", "matrix", "53:11", "do you watch Game of Thrones I do when", "53:14", "they have like swords that I made a", "53:15", "Valyrian steel just you're pissed off", "53:17", "you the fucker you fake magic no well", "53:22", "and what's interesting back in the day", "53:24", "the shit was fucking magical right they", "53:27", "didn't understand what was going on now", "53:29", "how did they learn I mean what is the", "53:31", "history I mean obviously that sword", "53:33", "there's from the 1500s but you know from", "53:36", "back in the Roman gladiator days and I", "53:39", "mean how did they understand how to do", "53:41", "this so the steel that they were using", "53:42", "in Europe was not really that great it", "53:45", "was not the best shit", "53:46", "Japanese Japanese were pretty fucking", "53:48", "good yeah as well as the Persians and", "53:52", "the Indians Vikings material wasn't the", "53:55", "greatest wasn't too barbaric no it's", "53:59", "it's just it comes down to what they had", "54:01", "available to them right yeah so who was", "54:04", "like the pioneer of like really durable", "54:07", "badass sword material was it Japanese so", "54:11", "probably so the Japanese and the Persian", "54:15", "/ Indonesian Persians swords are", "54:19", "probably the most legendary we know", "54:21", "they're the ones where like it could cut", "54:24", "through silk floating in the air and", "54:25", "shit like that", "54:26", "why is that what did they do different", "54:28", "so it's so the Persian steel is still", "54:33", "very very very similar to these", "54:36", "meteorite so it's a crew so it starts", "54:38", "it's called a crucible steel and so", "54:40", "essentially there's this clay jar", "54:42", "essentially called a crucible people", "54:45", "mount all kinds of stuff in it but you",

there's got to be an art to actually", "58:54", "sharpening things too right oh for sure", "58:57", "and how do you know like the right angle", "59:00", "to approach sharpening its I mean there", "59:03", "are a lot there are actually a lot of", "59:05", "great information online there", "59:07", "especially in big cities like Seattle la", "59:10", "New York Austin there at Portland as", "59:14", "well they're super reputable", "59:16", "people not only who will offer service", "59:18", "but usually offer lessons as well I", "59:21", "suggest like if you can't afford it", "59:24",

"59:35", "great that's perfect that's where you", "59:36", "want to be doing that you do you sharpen", "59:38", "both sides I do", "59:40", "so you sharpen the top and the bottom", "59:43", "I'm sorry", "59:44", "you mean the sides of the steel like", "59:46", "would you sharpen it like this", "59:47", "and then flip it off yes yeah now what", "59:50", "are those things and they have those", "59:51", "metal things for people Shang Shang", "59:54", "Shang yeah so those those ones seem like", "59:57", "I'm like that looks brutal I wouldn't do", "59:59", "that to a good knife it so my right", "60:02", "thinking that way well it depends on the", "60:04", "the type of Steel that your knifes made", "60:06", "from and then what the material is that", "60:09", "those rods are made from so those are", "60:12", "commonly referred to as sharpening rods", "60:14", "or sharpening sticks but the reality is", "60:16", "they're not actually sharpening what are", "60:18", "they doing so they're more accurately", "60:21", "referred to as honing rods so what's", "60:23", "happening at you I'm sorry at the", "60:25", "cutting edge of your knife is you have", "60:27", "all these micro serrations essentially", "60:29", "if you go take take it under a", "60:31", "microscope and look at the cutting edge", "60:32", "it looks like a saw blade mmm but", "60:35", "they're like they're fucking microns I'm", "60:37", "micron is a millionth of a meter like", "60:40", "they're teeny tiny so but what happens", "60:43", "over normal use those teeth they bend", "60:47", "over they flex over or sometimes they", "60:49", "eventually wear out and fall off and so", "60:52", "what the honing rod does especially if", "60:55", "they've bent over see shown right there", "60:56", "yeah yeah you want to ignore like those", "61:03", "long streaks and you're just like the", "61:05", "tiny little thin block yeah that's the", "61:07", "shit right there", "61:15", "observation you know it's like someone's", "61:17", "doing it to your instruction but that's", "61:19", "a YouTube video crazy", "61:20", "yeah that is crazy I was like are you", "61:22", "doing that should X magnification yeah", "61:26", "view from the top", "61:28", "hmm yeah so that's what's happening", "61:30", "along your cutting edge and what happens", "61:31", "is those tiny serrations where it bent", "61:33", "over like I was saying or break off and", "61:35", "so but as they bent over and it's just", "61:38", "normal shit that honing rod by swiping", "61:40", "across that honing rod and you don't", "61:42", "just do it willy-nilly like you got to", "61:44", "do it at the right angle and all this", "61:45", "stuff but what it does is it realigns", "61:47", "and hones those teeth back into", "61:50", "alignment so people mistakenly call them", "61:52", "sharpening sticks because all of a", "61:54", "sudden their knife is sharp as fuck", "61:56", "afterwards but the reality is that it's", "61:58", "honed those teeth back into alignment so", "62:00", "it can do its job again", "62:01", "now what's the purpose of the leather", "62:03", "strop so that's just a gentler way", "62:06",

"62:26", "or sorry a strop is that's a human hair", "62:30", "yeah Jesus Christ so just to give you", "62:36", "some reference a typical an average", "62:38", "human hair is about three thousandths of", "62:41", "an inch", "62:42", "whoa yeah and to help put that a little", "62:48", "bit more better perspective a sixteenth", "62:50", "of an inch", "62:50", "like a normal measurement 1/16 of an",

the", "63:09", "hair yes I shaved it yeah literally yeah", "63:13", "there's a big debate in the world of bow", "63:17", "hunting with broad heads with what kind", "63:21", "of steel to use and there's there's", "63:24", "harder steel that some people use but it", "63:28", "breaks and there's an issue with that", "63:30", "and there's there's like this big debate", "63:32", "harder versus steel that is less hard", "63:36", "but will Bend more and give slightly", "63:38", "more", "63:39", "you know and then there's there's a the", "63:42", "broad head that I use which is a carbon",

so", "63:57", "you're talking it's just the head like", "63:59", "determine just what a triangular or is", "64:01", "it even a hunting the one that I use", "64:04", "yeah it is it's it has three points or", "64:09", "four points yeah that's it oh yeah sure", "64:13", "so has three points but that's that's a", "64:15", "carbon steel broad head that's what I", "64:17", "shot my elk with last year with and that", "64:20", "thing is virtually indestructible", "64:22", "yeah there's a crazy photograph I'll", "64:25", "show you this crazy video oh I put it up", "64:26", "on my Instagram find it on my Instagram", "64:28", "where my eye was fucking around with", "64:33", "something on my bow at at full draw was", "64:36", "trying to set something in the book the", "64:38", "bow went off and he hit a cement wall", "64:40", "and it stuck into the wall like a cinder", "64:44", "block or saw it's a solid cement wall", "64:46", "and didn't kill the broad head I still", "64:49", "have a broad head back there it's stuck", "64:51", "into the broad head look at it did", "64:53", "it's stuck into the broad head the shaft", "64:55", "yeah look what it did to the to the", "64:58", "arrow now look at that yeah that brought", "65:00", "it that fucking thing's got my bet for", "65:03", "life", "65:04", "yeah those things got my confidence", "65:05", "forever because if that does that to", "65:07", "concrete what will that do to bone right", "65:09", "you know that will go through anything", "65:11", "that's gonna kick some ass so but one of", "65:12", "the things I would say after seeing that", "65:14", "especially that first image is the", "65:16", "geometry of the blades that the actual", "65:20", "points mm-hmm", "65:21", "they lend themselves similarly to how", "65:24", "your hunting knife is sharpened", "65:25", "differently from your chef's knife", "65:26", "mm-hmm like the chef's knife materials", "65:29", "thinner but they're also sharpened at", "65:31", "different angles because they have", "65:32", "different jobs they're supposed to do", "65:34", "and so the broader essentially are sorry", "65:36", "the more acute that is the more easily", "65:38", "that will break as well as the thinner", "65:40", "the thinner of the material that that", "65:42", "that geometry is living on is more", "65:45", "susceptible to breaking that first image", "65:48", "that Jamie pulled up the geometry looked", "65:50", "like it was pretty robust hold it up", "65:52", "again", "65:53", "yeah as well as like it looks like it's", "65:55", "probably at least 30 thousandths of an", "65:57", "inch thick which is you know that's", "66:00", "about if not more and I'll the original", "66:03", "image Jimmy we see the actual broad head", "66:05", "and without the yeah my friend Brian", "66:10", "Stevens turned me on to these he he yeah", "66:14", "shot a bear through the head with one of", "66:16", "those G's was from ten feet away it was", "66:19", "coming at him and yeah he's got an image", "66:23", "of the skull that he sent me where you", "66:26", "could see the outline of that broad head", "66:28", "through the bear skull that's crazy yeah", "66:30", "and it killed the bear and didn't even", "66:33", "fuck up the arrow I'm like that was", "66:35", "crazy", "66:35", "yeah and so a lot of like you see people", "66:38", "doing these incredible feats like", "66:39", "hammering through nails and shit like", "66:41", "that with their knives like what the", "66:43", "fuck the thing that most people are used", "66:46", "to are chef's knife and they think they", "66:48", "did that with their chef's knife it's up", "66:49", "and 100 percent pretty much wood but", "66:52", "with the right thickness coming up to", "66:55", "the cutting edge as well as the actual", "66:57", "lead cutting edge geometry like the", "66:59", "actual angle that is sharpen that you", "67:01", "could do that shit all day long now when", "67:03", "you sharpen a blade do you use something", "67:06", "to hold it next to the stone so that it", "67:09", "reaches the perfect angle or do you do", "67:12", "it by eye I do by I actually if you'll", "67:14", "hand me over to me one of the things", "67:17", "especially when I first started learning", "67:18", "I would use my finger as a guide mm-hmm", "67:21", "so that would inform me as to the angle", "67:24", "so when the edge of my finger would", "67:25", "touch the top of the stone that told me", "67:27", "that was about the right angle and then", "67:28", "when I flipped it over to do the other", "67:30", "side I'd do the same thing with my thumb", "67:32", "and essentially experience I just know", "67:35", "from experience they do make sharpening", "67:39", "guides that you can clip on to the back", "67:40", "of the knives as well as little ramps", "67:42", "those are all great especially if you're", "67:44", "starting yeah the hardest part about all", "67:46", "of this is the muscle memory portion", "67:49", "it's figuring out how to lock in and", "67:52", "maintain that angle without wavering and", "67:55", "bracing your wrists and all that country", "67:56", "and that just it's it's like riding a", "67:58", "bike or any other anything you've ever", "68:01", "had to learn in your life with practice", "68:03", "and repetition you'll get better what do", "68:04", "you think about that Moto's", "68:06", "machines so it's like a little they're", "68:08", "like little like they're the worst", "68:10", "fucking thing ever really I I have a", "68:13", "like a almost kind of a conspiracy", "68:16", "theory that like the reality is like", "68:19", "they're designed to destroy your knife", "68:21", "so you have to turn around and reinvest", "68:23", "again because most people but one", "68:24", "because the knives aren't usually sold", "68:26", "for very much money that are being used", "68:28", "with those things mm-hmm and when you're", "68:31", "not selling them for Mary Mary much", "68:33", "you're relying on volume and what better", "68:36", "way than to create a thing that does the", "68:38", "job for a little bit but ultimately", "68:40", "destroys it and you have to reinvest", "68:42", "what about those ones where you stick it", "68:43", "in the slot it's a little slower process", "68:49", "but you you'll notice the problem with", "68:51", "those the real problem with those is", "68:52", "that you can't sharpen the whole edge", "68:55", "you usually start at the heel or just a", "68:58", "little bit in front of heel and then you", "69:00", "do the major work I strip myself oh this", "69:04", "is actually still pretty sure um and so", "69:08", "the problem is because you're not", "69:10", "getting the full length you'll continue", "69:12", "to dish this material out just in front", "69:15", "of heel and then when you go to cut", "69:17", "there's this little bit of shit there", "69:20", "that's not doing any work it's not doing", "69:22", "anything especially when you're relying", "69:23", "on that cutting board when the knife", "69:25", "comes down to the cutting board to do", "69:26", "some work it's not happening I cut my", "69:28", "lunch with that today nice oh fuck axis", "69:32", "that axis axis deer and elk oh my god", "69:35", "that was killing me well that gamma died", "69:38", "probably didn't say but yeah man you", "69:42", "know well I learned how to cook I mean I", "69:45", "I feel like there's some real art to", "69:48", "that as well from my friend Chad Ward", "69:50", "whiskey ban barbecue on Instagram he's a", "69:54", "like a pitmaster like a legit true world", "69:58", "champion barbecue master and he's the", "70:00", "one who taught me how to cook slowly at", "70:03", "low temperatures and then sear it after", "70:05", "you're done I always thought you're", "70:07", "supposed to just put it on high heat", "70:09", "cook the shit out of it and then eat it", "70:12", "you know yeah I mean it tastes fine that", "70:15", "way too but you know when you're dealing", "70:16", "with what I really had to learn", "70:19", "especially in particular cooking with", "70:22", "wild game is very unforgiving because", "70:25", "it's low in fat yeah it's got none", "70:28", "it's your basically eating a sprinter", "70:30", "[Laughter]", "70:33", "yeah so that's the end I reverse sear it", "70:36", "in a pan with grass-fed butter you hear", "70:38", "that pain beautiful listen to that sound", "70:41", "[Music]", "70:44", "that's the last of my back strap I got a", "70:47", "I gotta get some more meat mm-hmm I eat", "70:50", "the I eat so much meat it's crazy yeah", "70:53", "suab super healthy though bitch it looks", "71:00", "like it works no it's well you know what", "71:02", "- there's deer something really magical", "71:04", "about wild game and I don't know what", "71:06", "the fuck it is I really don't and I", "71:08", "don't think anybody does because I don't", "71:10", "think there's enough people out there", "71:11", "that are eating it but it has it has a", "71:13", "different effect in your body it feels", "71:15", "different when I eat even just beef like", "71:17", "if you have a race fed beef yeah like", "71:20", "total like pasture raised like oh yeah", "71:23", "oh my god the difference you know about", "71:26", "butcher box I'm aware of that yeah yeah",

"that and it's actually I feel", "71:49", "embarrassed saying that I've only eaten", "71:50", "really good beef happy beef essentially", "71:53", "only a few times yeah yeah it's hardened", "71:56", "yeah well unless in some place oh my god", "71:58", "when you take a bite like they even just", "72:00", "that first bite it's just like it's", "72:02", "entered a whole different world and it's",

like this beam is like it's", "72:34", "like this poor little sick animal right", "72:36", "it's all mushy you know it's like if you", "72:40", "eat a piece some wild moose meat it's", "72:43", "like whoa you eat it you're like holy", "72:45", "shit it's like filled with flavor and", "72:48", "it's right it just it feels like like it", "72:50", "gives you energy it's crazy", "72:52", "I'm totally by that yeah yeah it's like", "72:55", "the what is that people are trying to", "72:57", "like inject young people's blood into", "73:01", "the trying to make themselves feel", "73:03", "younger like

this get this done as quick as", "76:21", "possible and if it doesn't work the", "76:23", "first time we'll make some modifications", "76:25", "and we'll try it a second time it still", "76:27",

"76:36", "needed", "76:36", "mm-hmm but I there was a long time I", "76:39", "used to do a lot of woodworking before I", "76:41", "got into metalworking and I was I always", "76:44", "had measure five times and cut twice", "76:47", "right yeah and so I started getting to", "76:50", "this point where like I really had to", "76:51", "think shit through because I just to me", "76:55", "it felt like a huge waste of time", "76:57", "and energy and materials really to go", "77:00", "through all that process and then so", "77:03", "there had to be a long learning curve", "77:05", "though right - like really learn how to", "77:07", "especially I would imagine the forging", "77:09", "aspect of it it's probably incredibly", "77:11", "difficult yeah well and when I was", "77:13", "working for Bob", "77:14", "the only forging we did was forging the", "77:17", "Damascus to make the patterns and then", "77:19", "we would like cut blades out and go from", "77:22", "there I learned forging about five years", "77:25", "ago essentially working with a gentleman", "77:28", "named David lish who's also he's a", "77:31", "master bladesmith he used to work at", "77:33", "Seattle he's down in Olympia area now", "77:36", "but he you know he did he's a blacksmith", "77:40", "by trade that got into knife making any", "77:42", "fucking skill he's super talented", "77:44", "specially when it comes to bowie knives", "77:45", "and hunters like he doesn't really great", "77:47", "work and especially as Damascus patterns", "77:49", "are really great but to watch somebody", "77:52", "move and manipulate material and really", "77:55", "like I said before like stock removal is", "77:57", "a very valid way of doing it because the", "78:00", "cost of the actual materials is very", "78:04", "small compared to not the immovable", "78:06", "stock removal so earlier I was talking", "78:08", "about taking a bar and then cutting out", "78:10", "the blade shape okay yeah because you're", "78:13", "literally removing stock from that from", "78:16", "the start and you can do that would you", "78:18", "take what's left and melt it down you", "78:21", "couldn't melt it down you could turn it", "78:22", "and Forge it into other stuff it's it's", "78:25", "a really interesting practice it's", "78:29", "actually it's kind of like you know", "78:30", "people refer to yoga as a practice and", "78:32", "you know we're gonna be perfect like", "78:33", "there's never gonna be perfection and", "78:35", "blade forging but there's always an", "78:37", "opportunity to learn something and the", "78:39", "practice it and so when you see like you", "78:42", "have a decent little chunk you know you", "78:43", "start smashing on that thing and see", "78:45", "what you can get out of it to economize", "78:47", "that material and again like I said you", "78:49", "don't really need to do that because of", "78:51", "how inexpensive material is but if you", "78:53", "think back like even a hundred years", "78:54", "like this high-quality material is", "78:58", "fucking expensive you had to get the", "78:59", "most out of it as you possibly could and", "79:01", "so that's why forging was such a big", "79:04", "deal and then as that price went down", "79:06", "people change the way they manufactured", "79:08", "just because then", "79:10", "the time was the thing that cost the", "79:12", "most not the materials and so they", "79:14", "turned around and made it easier to", "79:15", "manufacture they didn't give a shit", "79:17", "about the waste now how did you learn", "79:19", "handle geometry like the handle in this", "79:21", "hunting knife so yeah yeah so your as is", "79:25", "very unique it is unique and actually", "79:27", "fits my hand perfectly yeah it fits in", "79:30", "your hand oh and that's that's the goal", "79:32", "a friend notch here yeah a friend refers", "79:34", "to it as the knife shaking your hand", "79:37", "back like it fits so well feels like", "79:42", "you're holding here for people that are", "79:45", "just listening there's there's an", "79:47", "initial smoothness in the front and then", "79:50", "there's like this little bump and then", "79:51", "like a little sister at the bottom yeah", "79:53", "and it just locks in your hand and so I", "79:57", "was inspired to do that by a maker named", "80:00", "Claude Bush movie he's a Belgian maker I", "80:03", "first met him WOD long he is a he's a", "80:10", "belgian maker", "80:11", "he the first time I met him was at blade", "80:14", "show which is a huge knife exposition", "80:16", "it's the biggest one in the world that", "80:18", "happens down in Atlanta every year the", "80:19", "first weekend of June he was my table", "80:22", "neighbor and I had never told him a", "80:25", "story but uh the first time I saw his", "80:27", "knives I was like the blades and", "80:29", "everything looked great with that the", "80:30", "handle looks fucking weirdest shit this", "80:33", "handle yeah it's very similar to that", "80:35", "handle his his has more of like a nice", "80:37", "gentle curve around to the end instead", "80:39", "of kind of held that one's kind of at a", "80:41", "clip or a tangle and so finally like on", "80:46", "the third day of the show this really", "80:48", "great maker that I look up to came over", "80:50", "and he was just like doting over clods", "80:53", "work and I was like all right there must", "80:54", "be something and I had me I'm feel like", "80:56", "such an asshole like I didn't even touch", "80:58", "the stuff I was just looking at it and", "80:59", "judging and I picked it up I was like", "81:01", "what it was it was a toll lead like what", "81:04", "the fuck right cuz - that same feeling", "81:07", "that you have when you're holding knife", "81:09", "it feels perfect I was like it it", "81:11", "totally shifted my entire mindset and", "81:14", "paradigm around what I thought handle", "81:17", "shapes should look and feel like and", "81:19", "that has definitely inspired continued", "81:21", "especially for like hard use knives", "81:24", "like especially like for a bigger blade", "81:26", "like a bush knife that you're trying to", "81:28", "chop through stuff with a handle like", "81:30", "that is gonna benefit you immensely", "81:33", "because it just it feels like a natural", "81:35", "extension of your hand and is this your", "81:37", "your logo yeah into the boss my insignia", "81:41", "so it's my name is marco mal massey it's", "81:43", "two M's kind of swirling around each", "81:46", "other and it looks kind of like a flame", "81:47", "dude I'm such a dork for this shit I", "81:49", "love it it's so interesting man and that", "81:54", "the handle too there's something about", "81:55", "the the handle being made out of antler", "81:58", "like the antler the feel that it has in", "82:00", "your hand to the organic materials yeah", "82:03", "organic especially antler and and bone", "82:07", "they have this kind of like I don't know", "82:09", "if you've experienced it with these", "82:11", "especially cutting up things like the", "82:13", "greasy meat but it from from Mike it", "82:16", "does it stays grippy doesn't become", "82:19", "super slippery or anything the handle on", "82:21", "my bow is actually made out of antler", "82:24", "you had it custom made my friend John", "82:26", "Dudley had these ones made from a bull", "82:29", "that he killed on September 11 2001 like", "82:32", "it's the 911 bull and he had these", "82:35", "handles made out of the antlers of this", "82:38", "and it does the way it sits in your hand", "82:41", "it's like it's got an even if you're", "82:42", "sweaty or right you know there's", "82:44", "something you know it's raining out it", "82:45", "just has an extra grip to it what an", "82:47", "especially something like that like if", "82:50", "you're skinning and breaking down an", "82:51", "animal in like it's important but it's", "82:53", "not gonna like it's not like one of", "82:55", "those moments where you relying on that", "82:57", "grip for your life right when you do", "82:59", "need that for your life like right", "83:01", "you're trying to do ours like you're", "83:03", "digging in the ground you're falling", "83:04", "down the hillside and you're trying to", "83:05", "jab in you know get it a hold like", "83:08", "that's gonna be really important but", "83:10", "obviously that's a very rare yeah", "83:13", "incident when that what happened well", "83:15", "it's just something cool about it too", "83:17", "well and just like the tactility yeah", "83:19", "it's just again it goes back to the", "83:21", "essentially the user experience like", "83:23", "what does it feel like how is it", "83:25", "different", "83:26", "like it makes it really does make a", "83:28", "difference yeah and one of the cool", "83:31", "things to me also about antlers is that", "83:33", "they shed them you know that they lose", "83:35", "these things every year and", "83:37", "that every year they grow a new one do", "83:39", "you know that it's the fastest-growing", "83:41", "organic material on earth no I didn't", "83:44", "know that that shit right there that", "83:46", "giant elk antler fucking dad throws in a", "83:49", "couple months I didn't know that yeah", "83:53", "falls off right they lose it after", "83:55", "they're done rutting so after they fell", "83:58", "off and they just kind of immediately", "84:00", "started like kind of slow like they grow", "84:02", "the whole thing back in a couple months", "84:04", "it's radical see if you find a video", "84:06", "that shows elk antler growth time-lapse", "84:11", "cuz it's crazy how fast it grows and", "84:14", "it's all just for war I mean that's all", "84:17", "that is its to show off for the ladies", "84:19", "hey and it's also for war", "84:22", "that's interesting dear yeah that guy", "84:24", "look at my rack yeah he

says over four", "84:46", "months they show the incredible growth", "84:48", "so April 1st watch this is like at a", "84:50", "farm that looks like it is looks like", "84:53", "it's an elk farm just let it play out", "84:56", "April 8th boom so 7 days later look at", "85:00", "that April 15 bang look how big that", "85:02", "shit is oh shit April 22nd it's getting", "85:06", "crazy", "85:07",

"nuts bizarre so by the time August rolls", "85:58", "around they're like right now the", "86:00", "beginning of September they're in hard", "86:01", "horned and they'll go to war and they'll", "86:04", "keep that shit for you know till the end", "86:06", "of the probably December I think maybe", "86:10", "January and then they'll lose it so this", "86:13", "is the fastest-growing organic material", "86:15", "yes by volume weight yes okay yeah I", "86:19", "think by all those things because it", "86:21", "grows so fast it's so heavy I mean", "86:23", "that's like 40 pounds just of antlers", "86:26", "and it grows over a couple months yeah", "86:29", "it's fucking nuts man this seemed", "86:31", "picture made that up about the", "86:33", "fastest-growing organic material but I", "86:34", "think it's true look and it says the", "86:36", "first fun fact I found it they can grow", "86:38", "ten pounds of velvet per year that's", "86:42", "just the belt just the velvet yeah hmm", "86:46", "yeah but that's probably because it's a", "86:48", "velvet farm you know they use that stuff", "86:50", "for human growth hormone I got a lot of", "86:52", "baseball players we're taking on it yeah", "86:54", "a friend of mine my friend John rivet", "86:57", "shout out to Johnny rivet he lives in", "86:59", "Alberta in his one of his friends had an", "87:02", "elk farm up there in Alberta and he grew", "87:05", "elk not for the meat but for the for the", "87:09", "velvet because that stuff that grows", "87:12", "grows so fast and it's so so", "87:15", "ridiculously potent that they would take", "87:17", "antler velvet and they were turned into", "87:20", "a spray that would equal the effects of", "87:23", "human growth hormone how could you do", "87:27", "that across species like that I don't", "87:28", "know but athletes were taking it", "87:30", "athletes were taking this stuff and it", "87:32", "was having this just for like growth", "87:34", "hormone reaction in their body aches and", "87:36", "like superficial year they like really", "87:44", "don't know", "87:45", "you know I'm too stupid to be answering", "87:46", "your questions but there's something", "87:48", "about deer velvet that was for quite you", "87:51", "know I don't even know if it worked but", "87:53", "it was a big thing in the the supplement", "87:56", "and fitness industry that people were", "87:58", "getting deer velvet", "87:59", "the new vet I bought it you spray it", "88:01", "uh-huh and it's supposed to give you a", "88:03", "growth hormone how'd you think of that", "88:07", "holy bear did you have your hand only", "88:09", "beer before yeah I have it's great man", "88:10", "it's great", "88:11", "Olympia yeah is this from Olympia", "88:14", "Washington is that what it is uh", "88:15", "originally yeah I think it's brewed in", "88:18", "Milwaukee now what the fuck I know", "88:20", "everything is being sourced oversee I", "88:22", "mean what you are from the Pacific", "88:26", "Northwest but now you live in", "88:27", "Connecticut the state are shit on the", "88:29", "most there's a whole video out there of", "88:31", "me shitting on Connecticut like people", "88:32", "have made a compilation of me shit okay", "88:34", "sure", "88:35", "I'm sure plenty of its warranted yeah", "88:37", "there's all of it shout out to my good", "88:40", "friend Tommy jr. religion Connecticut I", "88:42", "finally found it so I think it's just", "88:45", "antlers in general are the fastest", "88:47", "growing tissue in in any mammal yeah and", "88:50", "then elk antler is the fastest growing", "88:52", "out of all of them because it's the", "88:54", "largest so it grows in the same amount", "88:56", "of time that a deer would grow its", "88:58", "antlers but it's far larger you know", "89:00", "what give you that we've been more", "89:02", "massive than it than a moose uh no no", "89:05", "deer would be a musubi bear some moose", "89:08", "yeah yeah they're the biggest they're", "89:10", "the biggest of all of the deer species", "89:13", "like by far you know I think like a", "89:16", "full-grown Yukon moose could be as much", "89:20", "as 2,000 pounds a really big Rocky", "89:24", "Mountain Elk under normal circumstances", "89:27", "is like a fucking giant one is pushing a", "89:31", "thousand Gianna it's a giant though", "89:33", "that'd be like a four hundred inch bowl", "89:36", "like that one right the the inches the", "89:40", "measurement of the size of the inches of", "89:42", "the antler look at that you see that one", "89:44", "that's in the fryer yeah that's", "89:45", "considerably bigger than this one that", "89:47", "was the one out in the front it's 382", "89:49", "inches that's a giant bull she's and", "89:51", "that fucker was about a thousand pounds", "89:53", "he was you", "89:55", "huge moose is bigger Moose is twice as", "89:58", "big hips would see that thing go shut", "90:00", "the fuck up gotta go and you start", "90:03", "running but moose think they're the", "90:05", "weird thing about a moose is their", "90:07", "antlers are like a door you know it's", "90:09", "basically like right there so fat it's", "90:12", "not like pokey I mean they're basically", "90:15", "like they're hitting each other in the", "90:16", "head with doors they're like big old", "90:19", "gloves yeah and but you see", "90:21", "have you seen I've seen a few pictures", "90:22", "where the especially the moose they're", "90:24", "their antlers get locked up mm-hmm and", "90:26", "they're fucking stuck more deer than", "90:29", "move yeah because the design of a", "90:31", "Moose's antlers is like it's not as", "90:34", "intertwined but with deer it happens all", "90:36", "the time because there's a little bit of", "90:37", "flex to the bone", "90:38", "sure and so they'll clash and in the", "90:41", "force of the two of them slamming each", "90:43", "other they get stuck CTE well they drown", "90:46", "they've they've fought like that and", "90:49", "then you know wrestled and wound up in", "90:51", "the water and wound up drowning there's", "90:53", "a horrible video I saw of two deer that", "90:56", "got stucked and one of them got killed", "90:58", "by a coyote not just a whole pack of", "91:01", "them torn to shreds they tore him and", "91:04", "they eat them asshole first as I've", "91:06",
