insulin which is this mother", "07:45", "hormone is directly related to a lot of", "07:49", "health issues and and so when you look", "07:51", "at athletes you look at people trying to", "07:53", "be healthy they they the idea is to eat", "07:54", "foods that keep your insulin somewhat", "07:56", "neutral because that that otherwise when", "08:01", "you eat foods that oxidize as sugar", "08:04",

the here are the host of", "08:39", "reasons for it and if you actually look", "08:41", "at the literature", "08:42", "then more importantly if you look at", "08:43", "what athletes are doing and especially", "08:45", "Olympic athletes or or they are state", "08:48", "they stay away from sugar for the most", "08:49", "part it's a smart move", "08:51", "yeah stayin away from sugar does make",

here's", "89:43", "what's fucked up about that that is the", "89:45", "exact same day to the day as the end of", "89:49", "the Mayan calendar so he came up", "89:51", "independently on his own with this crazy", "89:53", "mathematical algorithm that I don't even", "89:55", "know if it's real it sounds ridiculous", "89:57", "but if you believe the guy he says that", "89:59", "he did not know the

it he fucking theok I missed that", "93:05", "dammit he bigger than that like think", "93:08", "about your mindset what you see you were", "93:11", "able to read the answer that was 307", "93:12",
