weapons", "10:13", "you're making bio weapons too", "10:15", "the idea is you're making a disease you", "10:19", "can inflict on the enemy right well if", "10:21", "you have a disease that can be

mean i've heard that a few", "10:55", "times to this well when I googled bio", "10:58", "weapon lab and one French I was talking", "11:00", "about history that comes up it says", "11:01", "experts no

all bioengineering let's break", "11:15", "that apart fascinating topic I mean what", "11:18", "one of the things that coronavirus is", "11:20", "making us realize is holy crap there's", "11:22",

scariest", "12:03", "thing and you can't stop it and it", "12:04", "happens all the time", "12:05", "yeah if viruses weren't so terrifying", "12:08", "they would always be beautiful the the", "12:12",

are", "17:24", "exceptionally functional to carry on the", "17:26", "things you need masks will be masks are", "17:30", "required", "17:31", "yes low the spread of this infection", "17:33", "listen I'm not an anti mask person and", "17:35", "would like one of the things that to do", "17:36", "is you have to start getting governors", "17:38", "so politicians to wear them", "17:42", "our President
