you know we're not on we're not", "28:20", "televised now can you just be honest", "28:21", "with us here and so there so I responded", "28:24", "immediately and said are you calling me", "28:26", "a

"45:32", "fact that Asian people score far better", "45:36", "there it's not there's nothing but it's", "45:38", "always fair that by conceding on the", "45:41", "data it's almost as if they fear that", "45:43", "the implication must necessarily follow", "45:45", "that the policy will also be supremacist", "45:47", "in that way hmm I wonder I honestly", "45:50", "think that what we talked

you would", "46:21", "I'm sure say absolutely I would worry", "46:24", "about that as well and then you would", "46:25", "have this sort of a discussion I didn't", "46:27", "get that from that

sand just trying to look", "46:41", "at the ideas and look at the statistics", "46:43", "and look at these studies for what they", "46:44", "are and look at charles murray and what", "46:46", "he's

"we just let things sort themselves out", "47:04", "and quietly ignore all the reality yeah", "47:07", "I don't know what so I should say that I", "47:10", "am I certainly understand people's fear", "47:13", "that if you could that anyone who would", "47:16", "go looking for racial difference is very", "47:19", "likely motivate and motivated by", "47:20", "something unethical or unsavory right so", "47:22", "like like you could imagine you know", "47:24", "white supremacists being being super", "47:29", "enamored of this the possibility that", "47:31", "these days is yes and they are yes and", "47:33", "so they look at the Asians too so so", "47:38", "that's like I get that right and there", "47:41", "is there's some things that and this was", "47:43", "the question I had for charles murray on", "47:44", "them on that podcast i said like why pay", "47:47", "attention to any of this what is the", "47:48", "upside in the in the infinity of", "47:52", "interesting problems we can tackle", "47:54", "scientifically why focus on population", "47:56", "differences and you know frankly i", "47:58", "didn't get a great answer from him i", "48:00", "mean yesterday his answer his answer is", "48:03", "well I think the best version of his", "48:06", "answer which I agree with but still it", "48:08", "may not justify certain certain uses of", "48:11", "attention it's just that if you there's", "48:15", "this massive bias that basically we're", "48:19", "all working with a blank slate you know", "48:22", "genetically and therefore any difference", "48:25", "you see among people is a matter of", "48:28", "environment and so so then you have", "48:31", "people who have privileged environments", "48:34", "and people who have environments that", "48:36", "that", "48:37", "where they're massively under-resourced", "48:40", "and so therefore any different", "48:44", "representation at the you know the", "48:46", "higher echelons of success and", "48:48", "achievement and power in our society you", "48:51", "know if there's 13% African Americans in", "48:54", "the u.s. if you look at the top doctors", "48:56", "in hospitals or the top academics or the", "49:01", "you know the Oscar winners or whatever", "49:03", "you know whatever you want to look for", "49:04", "for for achievement if there are less", "49:07", "than 13% African Americans in any one of", "49:10", "those bins that has to be the result of", "49:13", "racism or systemic racism that is the", "49:18", "left the leftward bias at this moment", "49:20", "and it and so it is with Jews for", "49:22", "anti-semitism so it is to women you know", "49:25", "there should be an equal representation", "49:26", "of women you know computer software", "49:29", "engineers at Google and any lack of any", "49:34", "disparity there must be the result of", "49:36", "either just inequitable resources for", "49:42", "you know kids in schools or somewhere", "49:44", "along the way or a pound of a

concern is if you", "50:00", "believe that and I'm you know this it's", "50:03", "not exactly what he said but this is", "50:04", "this is what I believe he thinks but I", "50:06", "could be putting some words into his", "50:07", "mouth here but there's certainly what", "50:08", "many other people on his side of the", "50:10", "debate thing if you believe that you", "50:12", "will can consistently find racial bias", "50:16", "and anti-semitism and misogyny where it", "50:18", "doesn't exist right so like if you if", "50:20", "you go looking if you go to a hospital", "50:22", "and this is a real problem you that", "50:24", "they're like like you know the academic", "50:26", "departments in the medical schools at", "50:28", "the best medical schools are under", "50:29", "massive
