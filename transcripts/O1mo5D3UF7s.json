so that's why elbows and then", "25:16", "a head man that is that's another", "25:18", "element yeah that's the thing so that's", "25:20", "why I think headbutt should PMMA I", "25:22", "believe I think so too", "25:23", "and if not well we have MMA which is", "25:25", "like the most generalists martial art", "25:27", "with the grappling and the wrestling and", "25:28", "striking but then

less cut", "26:26", "off I get less cut too right I think you", "26:29", "know in a way actually think like if you", "26:31", "look in general most", "26:32", "fights I have a bit less cut then then",

halo and it has a 50-pound bungee cord", "39:18", "like a grapplers love it like jong-hyuk", "39:22", "when shuttle swears", "39:23", "but can you do like heavy weights like", "39:25", "this I can do like a 45 don't you don't", "39:27", "do it wait no so the idea is don't think", "39:29", "it would be good to do weights I don't", "39:31", "know see it's it's very controversial", "39:34", "some people think that when you're doing", "39:37", "like the traditional I have one of those", "39:38", "head things a leather thing with a chain", "39:40", "like that you put a plate on it yeah", "39:42", "yeah I've done these but some people", "39:44", "think that that motion with weights puts", "39:46", "unnecessary pressure on your disc", "39:48", "okay so the idea with the iron neck is", "39:50", "there's never any pressure in your discs", "39:51", "because you never straight okay you got", "39:53", "a halo the halo sits on top your head it", "39:55", "forms and it's a picture you pump it up", "39:58", "so it gets tight in your head but I feel", "39:59", "like no those twisting can be a bit like", "40:01", "not detrimental for the disc you know", "40:04", "I'm just gonna try what's right", "40:06", "afterwards but I mean I'm not a", "40:08", "physiologist so I don't but I I've", "40:10", "talked to people that I really respect", "40:13", "they don't like the gay thing okay well", "40:17", "I guess because I use the width and I", "40:19", "feel like it like actually maybe you saw", "40:20", "a video I did with bass did it a and", "40:22", "then no I didn't see it eagle throat in", "40:26", "the neck I tell people that someone's", "40:31", "fucking with you like just grab their", "40:33", "neck", "40:33", "slam in the neck like that but this I", "40:35", "feel

"know you see that arc and you're rolling", "41:23", "back and forth and the thing is it's", "41:25", "tremendous pressure on the discs it's an", "41:27", "unnatural pressure okay this is the", "41:29", "whole concept behind the iron neck okay", "41:31", "is that you don't put that kind of", "41:32", "pressure because you never have like a", "41:34", "flex ation okay of the neck while you're", "41:36", "strengthened yeah but definitely like", "41:38", "for example when I went out let's see", "41:40", "you by the neck where I put the next", "41:42", "flex on my head and like when I

"58:46", "like for example day that was like you", "58:49", "know the lumpini champion came to", "58:50", "Myanmar and all the X I I don't know you", "58:53", "know a Muay Thai like sai-yuk", "58:54", "you know this guy I've heard the name", "58:55", "yes he's like a dump in a champion or I", "58:58", "think he's former worst Stadium yeah so", "59:02", "you went to me I'm are many times to", "59:04", "fight and he drawed within 2 min and all", "59:06", "these so he's just considered one of the", "59:08", "best muthaiya fighter ever right and", "59:10", "what is the difference like when when", "59:11", "Thai fighters come over there what what", "59:13", "gets in their way like well that's the", "59:15", "terms they're very technical and that", "59:17", "brings me up to something else but", "59:18", "basically a very technical and they do", "59:19", "very well for the first couple of rounds", "59:21", "but then when the pain threshold starts", "59:23", "to kick in when they started to clinch", "59:24", "and then to get ahead but there's no", "59:25", "what's happening here right and and", "59:27", "that's that's good that he asked me this", "59:29", "if you look at me amar you know and then", "59:32", "Thailand to neighboring country they", "59:33", "were fighting for thousand of years old", "59:35", "and if you look at the back and it is", "59:37", "the tongue to Empire I think", "59:39", "know the exact date but at that time the", "59:41", "Burmese Empire was like all the", "59:42", "Southeast Asia the biggest Empire in", "59:44", "Southeast Asia so they were owning all", "59:45", "of Thailand almost like Chiang Mai all", "59:47", "these things like you know I'm not sure", "59:50", "if yet Nam and Laos all these things so", "59:51", "it was very very powerful so that's why", "59:53", "they say that literal is the ancestor of", "59:56", "all the Mui Mui Lao mo Chou Muay Thai", "59:59", "you know because it makes sense they", "60:01", "were while they were owning all these", "60:02", "colonies right they were dropping their", "60:04", "seeds of their martial arts so then as", "60:07", "the retreat eventually pushed him away", "60:08", "and they became you know Burma as we as", "60:10", "we go we have another starting a thing", "60:13", "called Muay Boran yeah I'm Tyler so then", "60:16", "but then it's very suspicious like how", "60:18", "come you have that sport now with no", "60:19", "gloves and headbutts Muay Boran is that", "60:21", "yeah and you know but but you record", "60:23", "lies for a long time by little by me all", "60:25", "right so then basically their version of", "60:29", "yeah and they added big ropes instead of", "60:30", "doing bare knuckle let's wait it was", "60:32", "only a bit of cause they added big ropes", "60:34", "right so then that but at one point the", "60:36", "king of Thailand did a great thing to", "60:37", "attract tourism which removed the", "60:39", "headbutt and adding a scoring system and", "60:43", "added gloves a towns love and a", "60:46", "beautiful intricate and it becomes", "60:48", "beautiful Muay Thai as we know very very", "60:49", "you know technical very nice but then", "60:52", "and then what happened is that if I", "60:53", "let's say your your Muay Thai guys hey", "60:55", "you have Big Al's a towns love and you", "60:58", "borrow if you punch you don't score a", "61:00", "lot of points you know it's it's it's", "61:01", "elbows and knees and kicks that score", "61:03", "points so what's going to happen over", "61:04", "hundreds of years the guys are going to", "61:06", "practice their kicks and it because I", "61:09", "think the Tigers are the strongest", "61:10", "kickers in the world I believe and yeah", "61:13", "so so then if you go across in me I'm", "61:16", "are lay by the way guys no gloves no", "61:17", "scoring system and if you if you scale", "61:21", "only to win they swing for the freakin", "61:23", "fence right so that's the two different", "61:25", "type of so you have weightless kicks", "61:27", "inlets way because you pretty viralize", "61:29", "you prefer like you know no gloves cuz", "61:31", "you can draw blood right away with a", "61:32", "punch makes sense so yeah it's just a", "61:35", "history course have you thought about", "61:38", "fighting more and more time or maybe", "61:40", "even fighting MMA or do you yeah yeah", "61:43", "but not Muay Thai though and I'm like", "61:44", "I've done it I don't want to do it again", "61:46", "how come well I represented it to it", "61:48", "yeah so you enjoy it more yes it's",
