call", "13:03", "that Delta xx principal it doesn't mean", "13:07", "that's constantly going up that's just", "13:09", "not possible it goes up and down it just", "13:11", "keeps flashing so if we use

"14:22", "for example buddy's shake oh he's a he's", "14:26", "a former coach of Russian national", "14:28", "powerlifting to you so he took the", "14:31", "Soviet Olympic weightlifting methodology",

wiry guy you", "17:12", "wouldn't even take it for a lifter just", "17:13", "amazing so first of all the system still", "17:17", "remains if we would just take a very", "17:19", "large big picture 50,000 foot look at", "17:24", "strength there great many ways of", "17:26", "getting strong some of them very good", "17:29", "some Dermody ochre some very bad but", "17:32", "historically in lifting

just to", "17:54", "say it still is the best it still rules", "17:57", "so what they did is it was very", "18:00", "empirical in for example when you're", "18:04", "studying endurance going into the cell", "18:07", "studying the biochemistry of the cell in", "18:09", "the body taking apart figuring out how", "18:12", "this works is very helpful very on the", "18:16", "other hand when you're

"18:44", "just finish on this variable overload", "18:46", "and the Soviet weightlifting system so", "18:48", "what they did even though they also you", "18:51", "know they cut the muscle look at that as", "18:53", "well just didn't learn as much but they", "18:55", "coaches programmed particular loads for", "18:58", "athletes and watch what happen and then", "19:02", "they watched how the authors performed", "19:04", "and the watch how the top athletes", "19:06", "performed and it looked for patterns and", "19:08", "they were very open-minded so they're", "19:11", "not thinking like well it's got to be", "19:12", "just the heaviest weights will do that", "19:14", "or it's got to be the training to", "19:16", "failure it's gonna do that it's not the", "19:17", "case so just to give you an example of", "19:21", "how enormous that undertaking was so", "19:26", "typical strength training studies one", "19:29", "six weeks for some untrained college", "19:31", "subjects you know guys were just on", "19:33", "their phones popular media Jeff was also", "19:36", "world champion he studied the training", "19:40", "loads of top weight lifters only when", "19:44", "they were successful in

patterns just emerged", "19:56", "so for instance I'm gonna give you give", "19:59", "you a rundown on what the patterns are", "20:02", "there are certain optimal volumes how", "20:05", "much exercise you do there is certain", "20:08", "optimal intensities so if you followed", "20:11", "the variable overload method the optimal", "20:15", "intensity so the average intensity would", "20:18", "be about 75 percent of your max which", "20:20", "for most people will be probably", "20:21", "somewhere like eight reps or something", "20:24", "could do maybe ten maybe eight and you", "20:31", "will see that about half of all the", "20:33", "lifts that you do are about 75 80", "20:36", "percent now we're do all the rest the", "20:39", "other lifts come in so there's a normal", "20:41", "distribution so you'll find that 75 80 %", "20:45", "on the top 80 85 a little bit lower you", "20:48", "know so the lighter weights like 60% are", "20:53", "in the bottom and they have your waist", "20:55", "like a 90 percent and higher are in the", "20:57", "bottom as well", "20:58", "so the figured out you just have to do", "21:00", "most of your work with these average", "21:02", "weights

out", "22:43", "that it D reps are too low really giving", "22:45", "a weight you don't get stronger if the", "22:47", "reps get too high either the athlete", "22:50", "gets hurt or his technique is",

purely empirical this", "23:12", "particular method is purely empirical it", "23:14", "worked for decades it still does and", "23:17", "that's one of the ways you can get", "23:19", "strong so in

there are some subtle changes as", "24:39", "you progress there are some subtleties", "24:41", "like for instance notice that I said", "24:45", "that you have to use some heavy lifts", "24:47", "like 90 percent 95 percent it has to be", "24:49", "very surgical about how many so for", "24:52", "instance beginners do none advanced", "24:55", "lifters need to do just some but not", "24:56", "many intermediate lifters can do the", "24:59", "most or heavier weight lifters can do", "25:01", "not as many lighter ones can do more so", "25:04", "there are some differences at different", "25:06",

"the special skill Medvedev made a very", "25:19", "strong case very strong case of that", "25:21", "they used the Soviet of abysm for that", "25:25", "was restoratives and they said this is", "25:29", "universal even with restoratives or not", "25:31", "the difference for this for the drugs", "25:34", "would be is just that the volumes will", "25:35", "be higher you'll be able to train more", "25:37", "that's pretty much the difference but", "25:40", "the body will still work the same way", "25:41", "now these principles have they caught on", "25:45", "in the United States", "25:46", "I mean they've caught on with strong", "25:48", "first I know the UT you implement these", "25:51", "and people teach these but is this", "25:53", "something that's universally sort of",

"26:17", "powerlifting programs that have been", "26:19", "imported here by the use by power", "26:21", "lifters mm-hmm the other is we have the", "26:23", "program called plant-strong which is",

rep thing is a", "29:57", "it's very embraced here in America", "30:02", "yeah with meatheads which are my people", "30:05", "the the thing about it is that you think", "30:08", "that mental toughness

lifters in the gym and try to", "32:46", "repeat exactly what they do and that's", "32:48", "what happens after that nothing good", "32:50", "happens from that hmm you have to be", "32:52", "tough when it's time and the gym you", "32:55", "have to do the plan and like for example", "33:02", "let's talk about heavy lifting just", "33:04", "heavy singles let's say if I'm sure", "33:08", "everybody who listens to your program", "33:10", "has at what point of their life decided", "33:13", "to up their benchpress", "33:15", "by going to a maximum once a week I'm", "33:18", "sure everybody has I have you have", "33:20", "everybody has how how long did it last", "33:23", "typically six weeks for beginner and an", "33:27", "advanced lifter might tolerate two or", "33:29", "three weeks and that's about it", "33:31", "so for whatever reasons after that you", "33:34", "know your nervous system starts burning", "33:35", "out your endocrine system can keep up", "33:38", "and that's it so for that reason before", "33:41", "the competition you might take like a", "33:43", "90% single a double or something like", "33:46", "that and if you look at the longevity of", "33:50",

"well", "34:00", "David rigored himself who was the", "34:02", "champion around you know in the 70s so", "34:05", "he is way he is probably pushing 70", "34:07", "right now you know lives in a farm works", "34:10", "in the farm but he's Co doing great very", "34:12", "healthy but his coach that's that's", "34:15", "anyone more interesting story rudolf", "34:18", "plukfelder he was probably the oldest to", "34:22", "win the Olympics and weightlifting he", "34:24", "was 36 and he worked in the mines in", "34:28", "daytime and then train hard so look for", "34:31", "that ethnically here so ethnically he's", "34:34", "German so it one of the Germans living", "34:36", "in the Soviet Union and eventually when", "34:40", "the Soviet Union fell apart", "34:41", "crooked emigrated to Germany yeah a", "34:47", "journalist came to visit him and so", "34:50", "here's this really spry looking guy", "34:52", "pulling her on in the garden and the", "34:55", "Gerald is asking pardon me sir may I", "34:56", "speak to your dad so here's this guy who", "34:59", "is almost 90 years old still looks about", "35:03", "30 years younger who still does jump", "35:06", "squats with 90 kilos four sets of ten", "35:07", "and this is an example so have your", "35:13", "weights don't have the same longevity", "35:14", "but does house more that does not have", "35:17", "anything to do with the training system", "35:18", "that has to do with the fact that the", "35:20", "strain you put in your system by eating", "35:22", "so much just not so good but these guys", "35:24", "have longevity if you also look at", "35:28", "the powerlifters most successful", "35:30", "powerlifters american part lifters Eddie", "35:33", "cone competed for if I'm not mistaken", "35:36", "about thirty years at the

have a after", "35:50", "retirement is very very healthy so you", "35:52", "will find that the mentality of saving", "35:55", "this I have the tiger for when it", "35:58", "matters as opposed to treating every", "36:00", "training day as a competition that makes", "36:03", "a big difference for performance and", "36:05", "longevity it just battles the mindset of", "36:09", "always do more always push harder always", "36:12", "give your all leave everything in the", "36:15", "gym thus this is the mindset that people", "36:19", "have been sort of indoctrinated into", "36:20", "sure if they think that a hard work is", "36:23", "what really matters but hard work", "36:24", "doesn't matter but hard work can come in", "36:26", "a lot of different it can manifest", "36:29", "itself differently would that approach", "36:31", "have worked with a guy like Ronnie", "36:32", "Coleman because he's a bodybuilder so", "36:34", "bodybuilders obviously you're not", "36:36", "talking about competition and sense of", "36:37", "being able to lift a lot of weight and", "36:39", "you're talking about just mass acquiring", "36:41", "mass well you know the bodybuilders from", "36:44", "the older era like Franco Columbu very", "36:50", "sad that doctor Colombo passed recently", "36:53", "but he was an exceptionally strong man a", "36:56", "very healthy man he died swimming yeah", "36:59", "was a hard issue that has nothing to do", "37:01", "with lifting so he was very health and", "37:03", "very strong till the end and if you look", "37:06", "at the guys of that generation they're", "37:08", "you know they're doing great and if you", "37:10", "look at other bodybuilders power power", "37:13", "lift and let's say bodybuilders who have", "37:15", "some kind of a power bodybuilding", "37:17", "approach these guys have been around", "37:19", "longer as well if you look at the", "37:21", "old-timers again Dave Draper this guy's", "37:23", "name Oh Clarence best you know cleans", "37:24", "bath sure okay super shredded Clarence", "37:27", "is a friend of mine and Clarence is well", "37:30", "let's put it this way he's not a spring", "37:33", "chicken but he's got an absolutely", "37:35", "spectacular physique he's still staying", "37:37", "very strong are there reasons determined", "37:39", "yeah what how old is", "37:41", "no it's gotta be in the seventies right", "37:44", "pushing 80 possibly yeah there he is", "37:48", "yup that's Chloe's he's awesome that", "37:51", "guy's awesome that is crazy that picture", "37:53", "of him lifting his shirt up with this", "37:55", "complete grandpa face and just super", "37:59", "jacked body the guy's incredible yeah he", "38:03", "knows how to push himself when you need", "38:05", "to move himself yeah well he's very very", "38:08", "intelligent that guy but old top", "38:10", "athletes and lifters are very", "38:12", "intelligent mmm there are some flukes", "38:14", "but they don't last long right I see", "38:16", "what you're saying yeah for longevity", "38:17", "you sort of have to have that sort of", "38:19", "intelligent approach so do you think the", "38:22", "guy like Ronnie Coleman would have would", "38:24", "be able to achieve the mass and the size", "38:27", "and the the way he was built with a", "38:29", "different strategy I can speculate I", "38:33", "don't know but I can speculate but if", "38:34", "you look at the muscle mass that have", "38:37", "been achieved by heavyweight power", "38:39", "lifters like Kirk Kowalski look up that", "38:43", "guy Kurt Kowalski K a are W o s ki so if", "38:51", "you see that type of development", "38:53", "achieved by heavyweight power lifters", "38:56", "then I don't see why not", "38:57", "hmm and bodybuilders have their own", "39:00", "additional techniques they still have to", "39:02", "do their stuff for their separation and", "39:03", "whatever it is that you do but I think", "39:05", "there's a very good chance that you", "39:07", "would have and if you look at the", "39:10", "successful power like Mike O'Hearn for", "39:13", "example that's a very strong guy he's a", "39:14", "power bodybuilder", "39:16", "there we go his car wash machines", "39:18", "crossing the size of that fucking guy", "39:20", "[Laughter]", "39:23", "yeah he looks like a body but look at", "39:25", "the size of his legs that has done is", "39:28", "ridiculous yeah and that guy just would", "39:31", "not fool around with tech whatever deck", "39:35", "and what-have-you", "39:37", "PEC deck yeah you say that disdainfully", "39:42", "why don't you say it was there's a lot", "39:44", "of people don't understand what's wrong", "39:46", "with it", "39:46", "you know machines are this is an", "39:51", "interesting point of view okay", "39:52", "there is a belief that machines are", "39:54", "great for beginners", "39:55", "and because you don't have to control it", "39:59", "they say ferns isolated so on and so", "40:01", "forth really machines have limited use", "40:05", "for advanced lifters when they're", "40:07", "injured or whenever they have to just", "40:10", "really focus on something so it's", "40:12",

free right now for your", "48:52", "free listeners that's something you can", "48:54", "easily do yourself well easily is not", "48:56", "the word simply so the duration of a set", "49:02", "is 30 to 60 seconds you have to select", "49:08", "the range of motion where there's no", "49:11", "there is no stacking there's no there's", "49:14", "no support from your bones at all so for", "49:17",

the", "49:41", "deck with your chest come up about half", "49:44", "way and come back down and the speed is", "49:47", "very slow so there's no momentum at all", "49:50", "now doesn't sound like anything new but", "49:53", "here's what's new juliana i optimize the", "49:57", "rest periods and and that's a big dmg", "50:00", "game-changer normally when people train", "50:02", "in this manner

to failure and in this particular", "50:13", "case that's just a muscular training", "50:14", "that's not strength training per se so", "50:18", "they try to run for one set to the next", "50:21", "so they'll do this let's say that 30", "50:23", "seconds said then they will just you", "50:24", "know rest for 30 seconds duty again", "50:26", "completely hammer themselves the problem", "50:29", "with that is even though we do not know", "50:32", "the exact mechanisms of muscle growth we", "50:36", "do know that some lactic acid is needed", "50:41", "but too much like the Cassidy's", "50:43", "destructor so what see Leonov did is he", "50:47", "figured out is after this kind of set", "50:49", "you have to rest for five to ten minutes", "50:51", "and that sounds for people it's it's", "50:53", "very hard mental thing to do so here I", "50:56", "am going for this massive burn", "50:59", "and I have to wait for five to ten", "51:00", "missed but it's very simple you", "51:03", "introduce another exercise in between so", "51:07", "train twice a week five to five to ten", "51:11", "sets on the heavy day eventually once", "51:15", "you build up to it and about one to",

"51:26", "spectacular yeah because even though", "51:28", "there are explosive elements there as", "51:30", "well but it's also very much there's", "51:31", "that static element static endurance and",

protocol you know", "52:06", "what is both because because the muscles", "52:09", "getting bigger right and it will get", "52:11", "stronger but it won't be faster it's not", "52:13", "something you wouldn't know great with a", "52:15", "boxer I wouldn't know absolutely not no", "52:17", "definitely not", "52:18", "wrestler yes MMA you just have to use", "52:21", "your judgement there be certain things", "52:23", "on your style yeah now this is it's so", "52:27", "interesting hearing this big long break", "52:31", "in between exercises because it makes", "52:33", "sense it makes sense you would want the", "52:36", "muscles to be fully recovered because", "52:37", "then they'd be able to do more work but", "52:39", "that's so counterintuitive to what", "52:41", "everybody promotes every you go to a", "52:43", "coach you get a you get a you know a", "52:45", "personal trainer or something like that", "52:47", "they they just want to burn everybody", "52:49", "out that's all come on let's go let's go", "52:51", "next exercise let's go let's go let's go", "52:53", "let's go that's about feeling yeah", "52:55", "that's not that's about feeling and", "52:57", "that's about time management possibly", "52:59", "and there are other ways no and there", "53:02", "are other ways to save time there are", "53:04", "other ways of doing that depending on", "53:06", "your circumstances you can definitely", "53:08", "find ways of doing that but you can fill", "53:10", "in the time with other things", "53:12", "you know let's say you're doing this", "53:15", "hypertrophy protocol and by the way", "53:18", "that's been used extensively by Russian", "53:20", "national judo and Sambo teams so you're", "53:23", "doing some rows and the belt you know", "53:25", "the guys holding you up then you walk", "53:28", "around for a minute you do the push-ups", "53:29", "then you walk around you do something", "53:31", "else so you're making good use of the", "53:33", "time you're just not revisiting the same", "53:35", "exercise so instead of taking ten", "53:39", "minutes in between any workout at all", "53:40", "you would take just a couple minutes", "53:41", "you're in between and then do like", "53:44", "push-ups and then do something that's", "53:45", "non related to that so think of it as a", "53:47", "slow circuit mmm yeah okay slow circuit", "53:51", "but then you'd go back to whatever it", "53:53", "was that you were initially doing ten", "53:55", "minutes later correct yeah so those", "53:57", "muscles are recovered but", "53:59", "physiologically you're still getting", "54:00", "this constant state of exercise or at", "54:03", "least fairly constant with some you with", "54:05", "the lowest amount of break in between an", "54:08", "exercise you recommend that would be", "54:10", "that's the guidelines Eliana's", "54:12", "guidelines about five minutes if they", "54:13", "arrest is active for the same access I'm", "54:16", "talking about so active rest means", "54:18", "you're moving you're not just sitting", "54:19", "jumprope maybe not necessarily this", "54:22", "would be probably just walking around", "54:23", "maybe could do some super easy shot of", "54:26", "boxing or something or like footwork or", "54:28", "some but I mean extremely extremely easy", "54:30", "so that facilitates the circulation okay", "54:32", "yeah just just do that and it'll pass if", "54:35", "it's longer that's wow it's again so", "54:39", "counterintuitive to what most people", "54:41", "call like particularly something like", "54:43", "CrossFit right CrossFit is all about", "54:46", "massive reps and doing the most that you", "54:49", "possibly can and you know switching from", "54:51", "one thing quickly to another thing how", "54:53", "do you feel about that", "54:55", "so how about we take one minute I'll get", "54:57", "myself another tee and I'll address that", "54:59", "I'm good yeah choice it's good question", "55:04", "man", "55:04", "very good question excellent questions", "55:05", "oh thank you another do you know how to", "55:08", "do it no no idea", "55:10", "all right Jamie will do it for you right", "55:13", "now it's all you I have a cup here I", "55:16", "think he's gonna get you another cup it", "55:18", "whether you like it or not this is not", "55:21", "in the in the shot is it it doesn't", "55:24", "matter okay to me in the shot", "55:27", "that this all this uh this stuff is so", "55:32", "it's so interesting because it's so", "55:34", "obviously I mean make sense but it's", "55:38", "just not the method that anyone thank", "55:42", "you look at the top coaches if you look", "55:51", "at top athletes who don't necessarily", "55:52", "advertise what they're doing that's not", "55:54", "that's not the case", "55:55", "so it's more common now is getting there", "55:58", "yeah oh sorry this let me let me do this", "56:01", "let me dump this in there are you a tea", "56:06", "fanatic no I'm just a warm liquid", "56:09", "fanatic my best my favorite my favorite", "56:14", "worm liquidus Canetti no Italians make", "56:18", "it it's like zest from lemon and you", "56:21", "boil it stuff is good yeah yeah do you", "56:25", "drink caffeine yeah yeah occasionally", "56:28", "no no twice a day but just a very small", "56:30", "alone don't want to be running running", "56:33", "your own buzzing yeah that's what I like", "56:35", "about it you like buzzing yeah I'm good", "56:38", "man", "56:38", "keep buzzing so tell me about CrossFit", "56:43", "so CrossFit was it what is your question", "56:45", "about CrossFit exactly the methods that", "56:47", "they use this the sort of competition", "56:50", "with Olympic style lifts doing it to", "56:54", "maximum reps doing it for speed do you", "56:57", "think that's a recipe for injury or do", "57:01", "you think it's a good modality if", "57:02", "pursued correctly I'm going to start by", "57:06", "saying that I like the fact that", "57:10", "CrossFit gets people out guess people", "57:12", "training they have a great community", "57:13", "people are very motivated I like the", "57:16", "fact that they understand the concept of", "57:19", "general physical preparation which means", "57:21", "you have to train multiple different", "57:23", "qualities I would not go about it the", "57:26", "way they do it and let me explain to you", "57:28", "why so let's talk about endurance so", "57:35", "there are different aspects to endurance", "57:38", "and so there's cardio and there is the", "57:44", "local the peripheral endurance in the", "57:47", "muscles muscular endurance so first two", "57:50", "let's discuss how do we develop cardio", "57:52", "let's discuss how we develop endurance", "57:55", "in the muscle the best the healthiest", "57:59", "way to develop your cardio is just", "58:03", "steady-state exercise like running in a", "58:05", "particular particular speed that's not", "58:07", "too fast that's very simple that's so", "58:10", "that's way to develop cardio for most", "58:12", "people it is for most people it is and", "58:14", "so here's what's happening what's", "58:15", "happening is the heart is stretching", "58:18", "when you increase your heart rate up to", "58:20", "a certain point the heart starts", "58:23", "stretching more and it stretches more", "58:25", "and more so that increases the stroke", "58:27", "volume so pretty much you get a bigger", "58:28", "heart and that's good that works up to", "58:35", "not quite 90 percent of heart rate when", "58:38", "you start redlining your heart rate when", "58:41", "you start getting to 90 percent and", "58:42", "higher the heart does not have time to", "58:45", "relax fully so it really pretty much is", "58:47", "twitching so you're no longer really", "58:51", "stretching that hard so you want to be", "58:53", "training at the metabolic intensity", "58:58", "that's much lower something we're", "59:00", "getting pretty much sustained a", "59:00", "conversation so like say you're running", "59:02", "and talking to your body that's what you", "59:04", "want to stay to develop endurance that", "59:06", "what to develop to stretch your heart", "59:08", "that's the basic method so that's one", "59:11", "method hmm so the second method is", "59:13", "interval training so and the interval", "59:15", "training for the heart was developed by", "59:19", "Germans decades ago and these guidelines", "59:21", "still stand so here's what they figured", "59:23", "out they figured out that you're well we", "59:30", "know that this various systems and you", "59:32", "body have inertia so for instance note", "59:35", "is that when you're running hard and you", "59:37", "stopped your heart still beating hard", "59:39", "and then maybe ten seconds after there's", "59:42", "a sudden drop right there sir is that", "59:44", "inertia so the Germans figured out if", "59:47", "you get your heart rate up to about", "59:49", "eighty five ninety percent which", "59:51", "is it's hard but it's still not maximal", "59:54", "and then you switch to walking or", "59:57", "jogging so the heart is still beating", "59:59", "and so as this extra volume of blood is", "60:02", "moving in the stretches the heart so it", "60:05", "works really well so you can use the", "60:09", "intro method as well but it's it was", "60:12", "found it's used best after after a", "60:18", "period of steady state training it's", "60:20", "very demanding on the body and it's not", "60:23", "it's just it's too easy to have problems", "60:26", "with the heart if you start using it", "60:28", "prematurely then there's also such a", "60:30", "thing as high heart rate under heavy", "60:35", "loads so in this particular case we're", "60:37", "talking about dynamic exercises so as", "60:40", "dynamic exercise running bicycling", "60:43", "skiing even light kettlebell swings", "60:46", "that's dynamic exercise when you start", "60:48", "doing static exercises let's say you're", "60:50", "trying to do squats heavy squats for you", "60:53", "know to get your cardio so to say that's", "60:55", "not the best idea because that", "60:59", "interferes

bigger so it's not the optimal way", "61:10", "to train the heart you can again this", "61:15", "simple way you can use dynamic exercise", "61:20", "in interval type training or repeat", "61:22", "training in this case to train your", "61:24", "heart is to do an exercise that's", "61:27", "dynamic in nature to raise your heart", "61:30", "rate to about let's say 8090 percent", "61:35", "which would be 8090 percent it would be", "61:39", "where you can say maybe a couple words", "61:40", "you know you're not you're not dying yet", "61:43", "you can still answer a question and then", "61:47", "you just walk around and you do it again", "61:49", "so that's a simple way of how much time", "61:51", "walking around that depends that totally", "61:54", "depends on who you are to bend some", "61:55", "master how fast your you know heart rate", "61:57", "drops back down and what do you wanna", "61:59", "like is there a number you want to keep", "62:01", "it in the 140s the 150s is dependent", "62:03", "upon your age okay", "62:04", "in this particular case you would do you", "62:06", "would drop it down the original", "62:07", "guidelines were done for young people", "62:09", "those hundred twenty hundred thirty", "62:10", "beats so you're talking about sixty", "62:12", "sixty-five percent and pretty much if", "62:15", "you are just looking at being able to", "62:17", "pass the talk test which means you can", "62:19", "talk you know short sentences hmm I can", "62:23", "speak in a short something like that", "62:24", "right so for example you do a set of ten", "62:27", "swings really powerful with a kettle", "62:28", "bell walk around a little bit when you", "62:31", "feel that you can speak again you do it", "62:32", "again do it again so that's a simple way", "62:34", "of doing that but the heart is only a", "62:38", "very small part of endurance so we", "62:40", "definitely need to do some cardio for", "62:43", "health and athletes definitely need to", "62:45", "do for their performance but what we", "62:50", "really need to focus on is you need", "62:51", "mitochondria so mitochondria in the in", "62:55", "the muscle cell so that's where energy", "62:58", "is being converted to aerobic Li which", "63:00", "means efficiently so if you look at the", "63:06", "way your muscle uses energy so you will", "63:09", "get this energy with food converted it", "63:11", "goes down eventually the final currency", "63:15", "so to say is something called ATP but", "63:19", "it's only you know you only have it for", "63:21", "a few seconds so it has to be reloaded", "63:23", "so we have three main energy systems so", "63:26", "have the creating a phosphate system", "63:29", "it's very powerful but it's only can do", "63:31", "you know go for just some seconds and", "63:33", "it's clean burning we have high aerobic", "63:35", "system that's not powerful at all but", "63:37", "it's longer-lasting and we have the", "63:40", "glycolytic system that's kind of in", "63:41", "between that dumps a lot of acid and", "63:44", "other fatigue metabolites in there so", "63:47", "what we want to do as we want to develop", "63:50", "this mitochondria in our muscles it's", "63:54", "easy to do in slow fibers and it's a", "63:58", "little more involved in fast fibers I'll", "64:00", "tell you how we can do that but it can", "64:02", "be done so what we're looking for", "64:06", "instead of trying to trash the muscle", "64:08", "with acid we are trying to train in a", "64:12", "way that to produce less acid", "64:17", "and then only before the competition", "64:19", "right before the competition couple", "64:21", "weeks out you do a couple of kind of a", "64:23", "smokers like that to get yourself used", "64:26", "to that that's thing so the way we", "64:29", "develop mitochondria which means make", "64:32", "your muscle oxidative make your muscle", "64:34", "enduring and not polluting in slow fiber", "64:38", "is it's simply moving right below", "64:41", "anaerobic threshold so anaerobic", "64:44", "threshold", "64:44", "it's that intensity at which you you", "64:50", "know acid is accumulating just up to a", "64:52", "certain point it stays at that steady", "64:54", "state and you can keep disposing of that", "64:55", "for a while", "64:57", "for quite a while as soon as you go", "64:59", "above it very rapidly you crash so", "65:06", "running right below that aerobic", "65:09", "threshold is the primary training method", "65:13", "for endurance athletes and how do you", "65:16", "know that you ran the threshold when you", "65:18", "fail in the TOC test that's a simple way", "65:20", "to do that and it's very interesting", "65:22", "that endurance athletes even though who", "65:25", "are not necessarily well-educated they", "65:26", "kind of tend to grab it taste or that", "65:30", "intensity and so what happens is we are", "65:32", "producing just small amounts of acid and", "65:35", "the body finally is able to you know", "65:38", "produce less and less so that's how we", "65:40", "train our robic I'm sorry that's how we", "65:44", "train mitochondria in slow fibers for", "65:47", "fast fibers it's become something more", "65:49", "interesting so the conditions the", "65:56", "conditions for making the mitochondria", "66:00", "be able to handle more traffic without", "66:04", "producing as much acid is push them just", "66:07", "to the edge of acidosis just just to the", "66:10", "edge and do it over and over and over so", "66:13", "professor Becker sanski back in the 80s", "66:17", "figure out that that's a guy who", "66:18", "invented plyometrics and so on so he", "66:20", "figured out so here's what we do imagine", "66:24", "that you are sprinting as he's sprinting", "66:28", "for five seven seconds", "66:30", "and then you are just walking and you're", "66:34", "sprinting again and you're just walking", "66:36", "but you're doing that you're measuring", "66:39", "your blood lactate and it still keeps", "66:42", "below the threshold and you sustain that", "66:44", "for let's say 40 minutes so think of", "66:46", "this for a second", "66:47", "so you're sprinting very intensely but", "66:51", "you stop before you start burning you", "66:53", "get to the point of just light muscular", "66:56", "fatigue and you do it over and over and", "66:59", "over so if we talk about the coaching", "67:04", "terminology its repeat training versus", "67:08", "interval training so what is interval", "67:11", "training partners you'll have to take a", "67:14", "step to the side so the three types of", "67:17", "rest periods between your sets while", "67:20", "you're running lifting whatever so", "67:22", "there's a stress period that means that", "67:25", "you will have a harder time to do the", "67:28", "same thing or you will not be able to", "67:31", "repeat it right that's interval training", "67:33", "there is the super compensation period", "67:37", "which means if you wait extra long time", "67:39", "you'll perform even better like for", "67:41", "example if you do a set of pull-ups wait", "67:44", "for 15 minutes you might be able to do", "67:46", "more 15 minutes later and there is the", "67:50", "ordinary period which is that you be", "67:52", "able to repeat it over an hour so that's", "67:54", "in coaching

example of how we develop", "68:07", "mitochondria fast which fibers and the", "68:09", "same thing we can do with kettlebell", "68:11", "swings the same thing you can do work in", "68:13", "a heavy bag and so on and so forth", "68:15", "now CrossFit let's see it's a circle", "68:19", "back around to that what do they do that", "68:21", "you feel you said there's a lot of good", "68:23", "things they do they get people moving", "68:25", "they introduce people to all these", "68:27", "different exercise routines what do you", "68:29", "think they do wrong Joe I don't want to", "68:33", "pick on CrossFit this so called", "68:34", "metabolic conditioning has been around", "68:37", "since 1975 at least when Arthur Jones", "68:40", "coined that term you know the guy from", "68:41",

just telling you", "69:00", "this is what the science says experience", "69:02", "says is how you should be doing it", "69:03", "mm-hmm and I think that there are a lot", "69:06", "of great people in CrossFit and I just", "69:08", "wish you know power to them", "69:10", "you would just do it the what like what", "69:13", "you're talking about with longer rest", "69:15", "periods different sort of

CrossFit", "69:29", "exercise let's say wall ball okay let's", "69:33", "have the throw the ball against the wall", "69:34", "good exercise you do this thing with", "69:37", "this wall ball for 40 minutes like I", "69:38", "told you and you can incorporate a", "69:42", "second exercise in between Dustin", "69:45", "between stick it in there so let's say", "69:47", "you do a wall ball you throw this a few", "69:49", "times walk around you do a set of", "69:52", "push-ups let's say 5 to 10 reps and you", "69:55", "do this for 40 minutes", "69:56", "why 40 minutes it doesn't always have to", "69:59", "do 40 minutes but pretty much we know if", "70:02", "you can sustain it for 40 minutes it's", "70:04", "not gonna be overly glycolytic so we", "70:06", "just kind of know that I'll give you", "70:07", "another example let's say burpees right", "70:09", "you can do a burpee but time it in a way", "70:15", "that you can keep doing burpees for 40", "70:17", "minutes so you do a wrap

so", "70:44", "when you're running let's say 400 meters", "70:47", "or 800 meters athletes when they train", "70:49", "in the offseason the Train largely", "70:50", "aerobic ly", "70:51", "even though their distances are shorter", "70:53", "they're still not trying to trash", "70:55", "themselves", "70:55", "but we do know that even if you develop", "71:00", "your mitochondria if you do it correctly", "71:03", "and suddenly you throw yourself in an", "71:05", "acid bath your body is gonna be", "71:07", "unpleasantly surprised so what you need", "71:10", "to do is you need to model that so", "71:13", "what's going to happen is a couple of", "71:17", "weeks before the competition once a week", "71:20", "you were pretty much is like a something", "71:23", "similar to the competition like a water", "71:25", "whatever and this will accomplish", "71:28", "several things one is it will up", "71:33", "regulate your buffers so your body", "71:35", "produces baking soda pretty much to", "71:37", "cancel out the acid and it's a very", "71:40", "rapid adaptation it's very easy to get", "71:43", "just two weeks you got it", "71:44", "and in addition you also up regulates", "71:49",

"72:00", "as heart and respiration rate modelling", "72:03", "so which pretty much means that you're", "72:07", "gonna be sucking win and if you're not", "72:08", "used to sucking wind it's not gonna feel", "72:10", "good your diaphragm is gonna spasm and", "72:12", "not so good so the purpose of peaking is", "72:17", "to get yourself in kind of a simulated", "72:20", "competition situation where the acid is", "72:24", "high enough to make your body adapt to", "72:26", "it which adapts fast and to make", "72:28", "yourself comparable with Horry high", "72:33", "heart rates and breathing so that's", "72:36", "that's the summary that's pretty much", "72:37", "how track athletes train for", "72:38", "middle-distance what do you do now", "72:41", "account first of all how old do you 20", "72:44", "you look great thank you thank you great", "72:48", "haircut - thank you yeah I like it how", "72:52", "old you really I'm working on being", "72:54", "twenty Joe going back yeah", "72:57", "I'm 52 are you older than me I'm working", "73:00", "out we're both working good how about", "73:02", "you stick with that I don't want to be", "73:05", "judged based on my age I understand how", "73:08", "often", "73:08", "you train these days often do I train", "73:11", "almost every day almost every day just", "73:14", "doing something differently yeah doing", "73:16", "something mostly kettlebells or mostly", "73:19", "for the last several years with I", "73:22", "suppose less several month we're kind of", "73:24", "experimental doing something else but", "73:26", "for the last several years pretty much", "73:28", "has been nothing but swings and and dips", "73:31", "just one of my protocols it's a very", "73:33", "particular anti glycolytic protocol and", "73:36", "i glycolytic means well the kind of", "73:39", "thing we just discussed it just swings", "73:40", "in dips yeah why why that combination", "73:44", "trying to be minimalist pretty much and", "73:48", "trying to cover as much base as possible", "73:50", "also trying to do things that my body", "73:54", "likes but the swings are I would argue", "73:59", "that the swing is the most beneficial", "74:00", "exercise anybody can do because you will", "74:03", "again your training power your training", "74:05", "your fast fibers you're developing", "74:07", "mitochondria in the fast fibers you are", "74:10", "training your connective tissues and you", "74:13", "know you're getting your cardio as well", "74:15", "it's not you know it's not focused on", "74:17", "that but you have that side effect the", "74:20", "dip is you know kind of coverage what's", "74:23", "been missing I like the idea of very", "74:26", "minimus general strength protocols that", "74:29", "just have pretty much a hip hinge and", "74:31", "and the press that's that's a preference", "74:34", "without chin-ups or things along those", "74:36", "lines", "74:37", "sure is great I'll do him sometime but", "74:39", "you will find to your surprise that if", "74:40", "you do swings powerfully and if you do", "74:43", "dips or push-ups powerfully chances are", "74:46", "you're not going to lose your chance", "74:47", "really", "74:48", "chances are for most people so here's", "74:51", "something to keep in mind what is", "74:53", "general training versus specific", "74:55", "training so in Russian sports science", "74:58", "there is a concept of general training", "74:59", "versus special training special means", "75:02", "sports specific pretty much", "75:03", "so the general straight general training", "75:06", "can be strength can be something else", "75:07", "gives you foundation for everything else", "75:09", "and it's characterized by high degree of", "75:13", "carryover so for example if you decide", "75:16", "to do barbell squats you know for a fact", "75:21", "that you're going to", "75:22", "hire you gonna run fast you're gonna hit", "75:24", "order and so on and so forth if you", "75:27", "decide to go leg extensions you can be", "75:30", "sure that you're gonna get better at leg", "75:31", "extensions that's it so general", "75:35", "exercises are the ones that are fairly", "75:38", "simple to perform and give you to give", "75:39", "you the greatest possible carryover so", "75:42", "that's what you do and then after that", "75:43", "you start editing you more specific", "75:45", "stuff so let's say that you know you", "75:47", "would increase the number of chin-ups", "75:48", "you want to do what you got to do chips", "75:50", "so that's a specific practice absolutely", "75:53", "so Jennifer great one of the things that", "75:56", "I noticed that I thought was really", "75:58", "weird was when I started doing", "75:59", "kettlebells things that I wasn't doing I", "76:02", "got stronger at yeah like I wasn't doing", "76:04", "dips for a long time like I didn't do", "76:07", "them for months and months and I was", "76:09", "just doing kettlebells I was just doing", "76:10", "cleans and presses snatches swings a", "76:13", "bunch of different squat protocols", "76:15", "overhead squats my dip went through the", "76:18", "roof but it was so strange it was like", "76:21", "we call this the what the hell effect so", "76:23", "that type of carryover some of it we can", "76:26", "understand some words we can explain", "76:28", "some which we can't but yeah we've had", "76:31", "the kettlebell swing for example", "76:32", "increase the performance of world", "76:34", "champion power lifters and top marathon", "76:37", "runners at the same time it's a very", "76:38", "bizarre thing and again someone we talk", "76:40", "and decipher some with second but hey", "76:42", "we'll take it right what do you think is", "76:44", "going on there if you had a guess cuz", "76:47", "okay", "76:48", "so it's a number of different things one", "76:50", "is the type of the type of breathing", "76:57", "patterns that we use for example for", "76:59", "endurance that for that helps strength", "77:02", "and endurance so we use this pressurized", "77:05", "breathing that increases your strength", "77:07", "on exhalation so that pretty much", "77:10", "increases your strengths at any kind of", "77:11", "exertion whether it's punching or", "77:13", "lifting and at the same time we are also", "77:16", "training our muscles that inspiration", "77:19", "muscles inhalation muscles as well and", "77:22", "so developing developing these muscles", "77:25", "is really important for your performance", "77:26", "so that's just one of the aspects in", "77:28", "other aspects is the well this is kind", "77:33", "of interesting mr. Haney was", "77:36", "a coach for Danny Thompson Donnie", "77:38", "Thompson is he broke the 3000 pound", "77:42", "total record in in powerlifting some", "77:44", "years back so I'd known the Donnie for", "77:47", "some time so Donnie kept hurting his", "77:49", "back and his deadlift was stuck so we", "77:52", "met I showed her some kettlebell stuff", "77:54", "he started doing that invented a couple", "77:57", "of cool things of his own as well so", "78:00", "nine months later he added about 70", "78:02", "pounds to deadlift 100 pounds to his", "78:04", "benchpress said the total record and", "78:07", "what's what his coach said interesting", "78:10", "he said kettlebells work the muscles", "78:12", "without killing them it's kind of", "78:14", "interesting so it appears to be that the", "78:17", "particular stimulus that you have it's", "78:22", "there's always a positive and there's", "78:24", "always a negative when you're training", "78:25", "right", "78:25", "so there's something good that's", "78:27", "happening it's also something that's", "78:28", "holding you back you have to recover so", "78:31", "it seems to be that nature of whatever", "78:34", "things that happens within the muscle is", "78:36", "positive more than negative and I think", "78:38", "part of it is very well those ballistic", "78:42", "loading the body adapted extremely", "78:45", "extremely well part of it has to do the", "78:47", "particular training protocols we have", "78:49", "because we produced the right amount of", "78:54", "acid but not too much acid a lot of", "78:58", "trainees in the kind of a puffed fitness", "79:00", "world", "79:01", "they're just enamored with burn like oh", "79:03", "go for the burn yeah Fred Hatfield dr.", "79:06", "Fred hatch will have a great line so", "79:08", "Hadfield was the first lifter to squat a", "79:10", "thousand pounds in competition and he", "79:13", "was just a brilliant sports scientist", "79:14", "brilliant coach he said do you like burn", "79:17", "light a match yes people are just", "79:21", "enamored with the burn so again the", "79:23", "loading protocols we have his sights", "79:25", "that you have the right amount of that", "79:26", "of that stimulation not excessive", "79:29", "because what happens you have too much", "79:30", "like the Cassatt right is here's what", "79:33", "happens well many many things happen we", "79:35", "don't have the time to discuss this on", "79:37", "the show but most of them are really", "79:39", "rather than negative some positive", "79:40", "Muslim red the negative but for sure", "79:44", "they do make em work it makes you more", "79:48", "sore for sure", "79:50", "people like to say well soreness is just", "79:52", "caused by eccentric loading and that's", "79:54", "it has nothing do lactic acid", "79:56", "well eccentric loading does contribute", "79:58", "to that absolutely but acid does as well", "80:01", "he doesn't literally burn holes in your", "80:03", "muscle but it does stimulate lysosomes", "80:06", "something kind of eats up defective", "80:08", "components of the cell to function and", "80:10", "you also have the spike of free radicals", "80:12", "and so that free radicals damage cell", "80:14", "membranes as well so with what we do we", "80:19", "try to and plus there's other stuff", "80:21", "happens like but it starts producing", "80:22", "ammonia which is toxic and depletes your", "80:27", "ATP so all this things start going", "80:29", "there's really sideways so I think the", "80:31", "nature of what you do with

that other things that are", "99:29", "very good if they're used correctly is", "99:32", "hypoxia hypercapnia I'm pretty much", "99:35", "breathing less but doing in the correct", "99:37", "manner but there is something that you", "99:41", "need to keep in mind when you start", "99:42", "getting a really fancy and all these", "99:44", "different recovery modalities so these", "99:45", "differ", "99:46", "supplements and massages and whatever", "99:48", "whatever that was also I believe", "99:50", "professor vorobyev who made a point of", "99:53", "that that accelerating the recovery", "99:56", "first of all accelerating the rate of", "99:58", "adaptation is just just not normal and", "100:01", "again is gonna be less stable and second", "100:03", "that just makes your body less able to", "100:04", "handle by itself mmm spoiling yourself", "100:07", "with it I think so again not my", "100:11", "specialty", "100:12", "but I think it should be used", "100:13", "judiciously and I also think that too", "100:17", "many people are studying to get into the", "100:19", "fancy cars era P this or fancy", "100:22", "supplement or machine that before", "100:24", "they've just taken care of basics hmm so", "100:26", "what are the basics if yours let's say", "100:30", "that you are okay for an athlete or for", "100:32", "a normal person so what are the basics", "100:34", "for health for a normal person obviously", "100:38", "we discussed earlier you want to have", "100:39", "type 2 fibers and mitochondria and then", "100:41", "when you're older so that means you've", "100:43", "got to lift have you're fast there's no", "100:46", "other way there's no third way and you", "100:48", "just have to find the exercises that", "100:50", "your body can tolerate the next thing is", "100:53", "obviously have to do something for your", "100:55", "heart it's not in that much so whatever", "100:57", "lame government guidelines are out there", "100:59", "usually that will suffice for that then", "101:03", "today we know about sleep obviously and", "101:05", "today we also know about other ways of", "101:10", "promoting this overall resilience and", "101:13", "again cold things like cold things like", "101:18", "things like vegetables but strengths for", "101:23", "that for the athlete so I guess if you", "101:26", "get your if you get your diet all you're", "101:29", "eating and again what is the correct", "101:31", "eating I have no clue but I tell you", "101:33", "what there is probably a couple things", "101:35", "that most experts would agree on they'll", "101:37", "probably tell you lay off the sugar and", "101:40", "eat some green vegetables whatever", "101:42", "probably everybody except for those", "101:44", "carnival guys will agree on that", "101:46", "so get your nutrition dialed in get your", "101:49", "sleep doubt then then get strong so I", "101:53", "named organization strong first because", "101:55", "that's the primary quality so professor", "101:57", "matt wave he made a point that", "101:59", "that's the mother of all qualities upon", "102:02", "the foundation of strengths you build", "102:03", "endurance you build speed evil power you", "102:06", "build resilience everything so get", "102:09", "strong have your joint mobility in order", "102:12", "have some amounts of endurance the", "102:15", "minimum if you deserve it for health", "102:17", "again those government guidelines are", "102:19", "enough more if your sport requires that", "102:22", "then get great coaching and then when", "102:26", "you're almost a contender and then you", "102:28", "can start fooling around with all the", "102:29", "you know additional stuff on the", "102:31", "periphery and those things are really", "102:33", "personal they're really expensive", "102:35", "second of all some of these modalities", "102:38", "but second of all you know you might get", "102:41", "some a microscopic fraction of a percent", "102:44", "of improvement to your performance and", "102:46", "if you're training for the Olympics it's", "102:48", "absolutely worth it but if you're not", "102:50", "you gotta consider the point of", "102:52", "diminishing returns so like what are you", "102:54", "doing with your life what are you", "102:55", "spending your time on and the point of", "102:59", "diminishing returns happens and", "103:00", "everything so it's again if you just", "103:02", "want to be healthy you don't want to", "103:06", "hammer win just one thing like whoa I", "103:08", "just want to build up my deadlift to its", "103:10", "highest level or I just want to run the", "103:12", "fastest 5k you train your deadlift you", "103:16", "do some running you eat healthy maybe", "103:19", "you add some cold exposure maybe you had", "103:21", "some hypoxia maybe eat your vegetables", "103:24", "you know so adding each successive thing", "103:26", "you get to the point of diminishing", "103:27", "returns but if you decide to be a", "103:30", "specialist you still have to do this", "103:32", "general work what about sauna great use", "103:36", "it mmm sauna is grateful a lot of", "103:40", "different reasons right now normally", "103:43", "they just talk about things like micro", "103:44", "circulation which is all good heat shock", "103:46", "proteins which is all very good but", "103:48", "there's also something else there is a", "103:52", "very interesting phenomenon that it's", "103:56", "called our mad", "103:57", "what does it stand for something about", "103:59", "acute react a relaxation reaction to", "104:04", "stress I don't recall the acronym", "104:06", "exactly how it goes but hypothermia and", "104:11", "hyperthermia he", "104:13", "as amongst of the stimulus hypoxia as", "104:14", "well that allows you to develop reaction", "104:18", "in your body that didn't response to", "104:20", "stress you're gonna be more relaxed so", "104:22", "this is kind of an interesting thing so", "104:24", "it's definitely healthy thing definitely", "104:27", "well listen man", "104:29", "we've taken up a lot of your time and I", "104:31", "appreciate you very much and
