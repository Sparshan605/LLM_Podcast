legally", "07:06", "but the potential exists oh that's such", "07:09", "rubbish but that wouldn't have changed", "07:10", "the criminals yes they wouldn't have", "07:11", "changed the damn criminal", "07:13", "they put it in the hate speech category", "07:15", "and altered the criminal code", "07:17", "it's as simple as that and then you", "07:19", "could say well no we didn't really mean",

"08:54", "i like that this is a tempest and a", "08:56", "teapot it's like yeah okay fine", "08:58", "why'd you change the criminal code then", "09:00", "and why'd you put it under the hate", "09:02",
