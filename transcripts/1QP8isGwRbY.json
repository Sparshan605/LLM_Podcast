"53:01", "bullets I mean there's our hypersonic", "53:02", "and they poke holes in satellites they", "53:04", "can kill people in Space Station so it's", "53:06", "getting to be like my gosh yeah it's", "53:08", "kind of dangerous up there Jesus Christ", "53:10", "did you imagine sitting in the fucking", "53:11", "Space Station and you hear like bolts", "53:13", "yeah you're dinging and you're like that", "53:15", "just punched the hole as a hole right", "53:17", "through the other side and you look down", "53:19", "your leg is bleeding", "53:20", "they track all that stuff now so they", "53:22", "know if it's coming oh my god they track", "53:24", "the bolts that are flying in space", "53:26", "because how many of them are there like", "53:28", "hundreds of thousands now oh and you", "53:31", "have like whole like you know leftover", "53:32", "fuel capsules and all this stuff", "53:34", "astronaut poop that they just serious", "53:39", "like frozen you know", "53:40", "things they'd like beaned by a frozen", "53:41", "turd when you're out on a spacewalk a", "53:43", "kicking ow", "53:44", "I've had it semi frozen turd beamed at", "53:47", "me and it's still hurt I can't believe", "53:51", "that I can't believe this hundreds of", "53:52", "thousands of piece of junk up there", "53:54", "that's insane yeah no one's gonna clean", "53:57", "that either it's not like you can put a", "53:59", "net up there and scoop it all up yes", "54:01", "guess where most of it came from", "54:02", "military exercises let's blow up a", "54:05", "satellite in orbit and see what happens", "54:07", "like oh it scatters crap all over orbit", "54:09", "yeah it's just an environmental problem", "54:11", "just like we have in our oceans or", "54:13", "somewhere else the military so crazy", "54:14", "that in the 60s when they first started", "54:17", "like thinking about going to the moon", "54:20", "they did that a thing called Operation", "54:23", "starfish prime where they shot a nuclear", "54:26", "bomb up into the atmosphere and blew it", "54:29", "up they blew it up in the radiation", "54:31", "belts just let's see what happened what", "54:33", "will happen they're crazy nobody knows", "54:37", "nobody they had to go hey hey hey what", "54:38", "are you doing just fucking do it to see", "54:41", "what happens you guys crazy yeah what's", "54:43", "the benefit of shooting a nuclear bomb", "54:45", "into space you crazy fucks there's the", "54:48", "gun nuts on that stuff it's interesting", "54:50", "my grandparents met on the Manhattan", "54:52", "Project like in love in Chicago before", "54:54", "Los Alamos my my grandmother's a", "54:55", "master's degree in nuclear engineering", "54:57", "and one like a lifetime achievement", "54:58", "reward for a nuclear engineering like", "55:00", "one of two women ever it's like I grew", "55:01", "up in a nuclear family like this but", "55:03", "even they're like could we stop blowing", "55:04", "those things up everywhere like they're", "55:05", "kind of useful in a war but like maybe", "55:07", "blowing up a few hundred of them around", "55:09", "the planet isn't a good idea", "55:10", "well have you ever seen the there's an", "55:12", "animated gif file or it's maybe it's a", "55:15", "video that shows all of the on the globe", "55:18", "shows you a map of the world and shows", "55:20", "all of the nuclear explosions in their", "55:23", "correct order that have taken place all", "55:26", "the tests and it's like boom boom boom", "55:29", "boom boom boom boom boom boom boom", "55:34", "the union's boomp boomp boomp what have", "55:36", "you you should link to that hold that up", "55:40", "video of all of the nuclear explosions", "55:43", "just try to you'll you'll find it but", "55:46", "I've seen it it's fast there's been like", "55:47", "more than a hundred yeah yeah a hundred", "55:49", "nuclear explosions I did not know that", "55:51", "it's really scary and some of the things", "55:53", "that happen there we have a kind of a", "55:55", "rise in thyroid cancer and g-get", "55:58", "radioactive iodine out there and if", "56:00", "these have an environmental impact yeah", "56:01", "and some of the stuff we don't even", "56:03", "understand like low-frequency vibrations", "56:06", "on Earth's crust from those things", "56:07", "there's biological effects from the",

very", "56:28", "well as humans in fact in the Russian", "56:30", "space program they actually figured out", "56:31", "that they were not doing well at all", "56:33", "they actually replicate this inside the", "56:35", "spacecraft now they make a rumble it", "56:37", "just sound you don't hear it it's in it", "56:39", "like an electrical thing it's a super", "56:40", "low frequency EMF so this OH this EMF", "56:43", "that's given out by thunder and", "56:45", "lightning it actually has a positive", "56:47", "effect on human beings yeah it's like a", "56:50", "timing signal if we don't get it we", "56:51", "don't do so well it's right in the Alpha", "56:53", "brainwave spectrum oh yeah in fact I", "56:55", "have a human way of resonance creation", "56:58", "thing in my in my house like it's one of", "57:00", "things that lowers biological stress", "57:01", "when you have a Schumann resonance that", "57:02", "your low level biological like", "57:04", "electrical systems can sink to

that so there's an", "57:20", "electromagnetic signal on the earth and", "57:23", "it sounds kind of goofy to be honest but", "57:26", "one of the ways you can do this is with", "57:28", "an earthing Matt and I kind of went out", "57:30", "on a limb and I started for promoting", "57:31", "these as like this thing rocks and what", "57:35", "this is is is a mat it's made out of", "57:37",

recover faster like you recover from", "58:10", "injuries faster when you're grounded and", "58:12", "there's an electrical thing you can", "58:13", "measure that's happening there there's", "58:14", "two effects one is you build up a charge", "58:17", "on your body and you can just pick this", "58:19", "up with a meter you we're walking around", "58:20", "indoors or wearing shoes like rubber", "58:23", "shoes all the time so we basically just", "58:25", "the error over our skin builds up a", "58:27", "static charge when you get you know", "58:28", "spark you're like in the desert you know", "58:30", "you touch the most static electricity", "58:32", "that's an extreme example of it but our", "58:35", "bodies kind of work like big batteries", "58:37", "like we have different electrical

yeah with that", "66:22", "magnet helmet on remember yeah and", "66:24", "they're doing this like in in", "66:26", "neuroscience laboratories right now like", "66:27", "they have this really focused

used those magnets and", "67:31", "things like that we can we can explore", "67:33", "how his brain works and teach your brain", "67:34", "to do the same thing there's a lot of", "67:36", "things out there that are way teachable", "67:37", "that you wouldn't think are it's all", "67:39", "just about an interfacing with the brain", "67:41", "the way we do it now is really", "67:43", "inefficient if I have a gigantic magnet", "67:45", "on my head low I play better pool I", "67:47", "think it depends on how much the magnet", "67:49", "weighs probably well I mean as far as", "67:51", "like the frequent eat something it's not", "67:54", "something you'd wear it's not something", "67:55", "you wear I mean when I say 10 tons I", "67:58", "mean like this is a 10 ton thing that", "68:00", "that changes it and there's various like", "68:02", "articles from neuroscientist they went", "68:03", "in they did the test and they drew like", "68:05", "the most amazing artwork or in the", "68:07", "military they do other things like that", "68:09", "with more with the electricity but", "68:10", "they'll say oh look this person got a", "68:12", "stimulation here and they went through", "68:13",

such an", "68:20", "amazing toy you can completely change it", "68:22", "but here's the thing you want you want", "68:24", "to maximize this performance you need to", "68:26", "myelinate the nerves in

going to balance", "68:42", "on your bike right like you you've", "68:44", "learned how to do it it doesn't take", "68:45", "long from then on though to get so it's", "68:47", "just automatic that's what repetition", "68:49", "does and you've had a lot of pro sports", "68:51", "guys in here they talk about ten", "68:52", "thousand times", "68:53", "repetitions the reason 10,000 times", "68:55", "works is because your myelinating but", "68:57", "here's the thing what's milan made out", "68:58", "of fat cholesterol choline so what you", "69:02", "need to do is you need to be cranking up",

"69:17", "learn things yep if you don't have", "69:19", "enough fat you got out fat for your", "69:21", "brain to function I mean your brain's", "69:22", "made out of fat that's but you don't", "69:24", "want the wrong fat you don't want fat", "69:26", "from a stupid cow that I eat corn", "69:28", "no you down they're all stupid yeah and", "69:29", "you don't want fat that's been", "69:30",

get", "69:51", "through just knock one of these fucking", "69:52", "things over helmet with the horns on cow", "69:57", "started figuring out they could just", "69:58", "fuck us up the corn just grows there", "70:01", "just let it grow it'll grow by itself", "70:03", "I found that video if you wanted to", "70:05", "watch the nuclear explosion yes yeah", "70:07", "this is this is crazy", "70:12", "nice this is by the way just America", "70:14", "there's one of the world oh this is the", "70:16", "whole world oh here goes yeah that would", "70:19", "be like Nagasaki or Hiroshima yeah", "70:23", "this is so creepy we're so nuts one here", "70:28", "has a crazy statistic that we figured", "70:30", "out on the podcast yeah I'm from the", "70:32", "invention of the airplane to someone", "70:33", "using it to drop a nuclear bomb on", "70:35", "someone took less than 50 years that's", "70:38", "pretty impressive it's the same think", "70:40", "about that as like a world-changing yeah", "70:43", "it makes Moore's law look kind of sissy", "70:44", "that's pretty amazing you know 50 years", "70:48", "later they're dropping nuclear bombs out", "70:50", "of them Russia starts jacking some off", "70:55", "air boom Sun there we go it starts just", "70:58", "getting crazier and crazier after this", "70:59", "right now we're up to eight from America", "71:02", "one from Russia how long is this video", "71:13", "cuz for the folks at home eight minutes", "71:18", "of explosions but a lot of them are in", "71:20", "there's a lot of Soviet yeah there we go", "71:22", "look at those ones in Nevada", "71:24", "it just goes crazy Nevada just lights up", "71:26", "like a Christmas tree they're all in", "71:27", "Nevada", "71:28", "look look at all Nevada Britain how dare", "71:32", "you sons of bitches", "71:34", "in the ocean yeah you cowards dropping", "71:37", "them in the ocean look at Nevada oh my", "71:40", "god so scary they're all Nevada that", "71:42", "explains Nevada doesn't it fuck yeah it", "71:44", "does Las Vegas right it explains the", "71:46", "reason why it's allowed to exist yeah I", "71:48", "mean they do nuclear tests it explains", "71:50", "the airport they also bury they bury a", "71:54", "lot of nuclear waste out there and yes", "71:56", "look at Russia it's still going scary", "71:59", "shit man oh my god more Nevada look at", "72:03", "that and it's only 1955 look at how many", "72:05", "of them are going off in Nevada that is", "72:07", "fucking bananas and you can learn that", "72:10", "more compare that's like the recent", "72:12", "nuclear reactor leak in Japan yeah I", "72:16", "don't know this might be worse I don't", "72:18", "know I think I don't know which one", "72:21", "more and I think 30 brutal but they also", "72:24", "have shit buried out there too", "72:26", "they're storing nuclear waste out there", "72:28", "yeah spent nuclear rods and all kinds of", "72:31", "other shit that they think will be toxic", "72:32", "to the end of time", "72:34", "yeah we're just so ridiculous it's just", "72:36", "so weird that we would have something", "72:37", "like that just fucking start leave this", "72:40", "Wow", "72:42", "it kind of sounds like music look how", "72:44", "many bombs have gone off 300 bombs and", "72:48", "we're still in the 1960 like we haven't", "72:50", "even gone into the modern times it's so", "72:52", "1959 and there's been 300 bombs wow this", "72:55", "is really hard to watch but no kidding a", "72:57", "total downer", "72:58", "they were so stupid back you have any", "73:00", "Justin Bieber videos we could watch us", "73:02", "dead yeah I think you should show that", "73:04", "Brad what are you concerned about like", "73:09", "the the toxic shit that's gonna happen", "73:12", "from Fukushima is that gonna affect", "73:14", "people that live here on the west coast", "73:15", "yeah it is I mean the the plume so to", "73:19", "speak is making its way over here now", "73:20", "you know what does that mean we're", "73:22", "actually finding a huge amounts of", "73:23", "wreckage that are hitting the shore now", "73:25", "in fact up where I live in British", "73:27", "Columbia like it it's a big thing and", "73:28", "they're finding like motorcycles yeah", "73:30", "and like hundred ton like cement docks", "73:32", "that's or walk wash up and like how do I", "73:34", "get rid of this like it's indestructible", "73:36", "oh my god a cement fucking dock that was", "73:40", "taken from Japan yeah it broke free and", "73:42", "it floated all the way over here and and", "73:44", "it's like on the beach what's amazing is", "73:46", "that's a little baby tsunami that ain't", "73:48", "shit compared to what could happen oh", "73:50", "yeah so so that's happening but they say", "73:53", "that the stuff that's radioactive hasn't", "73:54", "reached there yet so oh god they're", "73:56", "starting to they're starting to have", "73:57", "Geiger counters on the beach like for", "73:59", "the drunk cleanup crews to see if", "74:01", "they're finding this stuff so the", "74:03", "question is what's it gonna do to fish", "74:04", "out here I sure hope that my sockeye", "74:06", "salmon is radioactive free and that said", "74:09", "you know I I think taking some iodine", "74:11", "yeah is a good idea I do what is how is", "74:14", "potassium iodine protect you well if the", "74:16", "form of radioactivity that you're", "74:18", "getting is radioactive iodine it", "74:20", "protects you from getting fibroid cancer", "74:22", "years later the problem is that some of", "74:24", "the radioactive stuff coming out", "74:25", "Fukushima may not be in an iodide form", "74:27", "so iodine may not do much for you", "74:28", "there's some evidence that astaxanthin", "74:30", "which comes from krill is pretty", "74:32", "protective as well so that's probably a", "74:34", "good thing too", "74:35", "so krill like krill oil so you take a", "74:38", "hat for him I prefer krill oil to fish", "74:40", "oil I take krill oil and I put and since", "74:44", "I put I buy a form that has asked as", "74:46", "Anthon in it which naturally occurs in", "74:47", "the krill it's the stuff that makes", "74:49", "krill red it's just a really potent", "74:51", "antioxidant that has a good effect on", "74:53", "radioactive stuff this is a podcast that", "74:55", "is gonna test your writing shit down", "74:57", "abilities ladies and gentleman this is a", "75:00", "podcast we're gonna have to go back I", "75:01", "use young salt by the way yak salts a", "75:03", "lot bet it'll make yak salt you liar", "75:05", "you're a fucking pillar", "75:07", "how dare you yeah I gotta get some I'm", "75:11", "gonna go right to full Whole Foods right", "75:13", "from here and get some fucking Siberian", "75:15", "salt yeah or Tibetan salt either ones", "75:18", "good it tastes pretty good like I like", "75:20", "taking friends who are not into health", "75:21", "and you're like just try the salt and", "75:23", "like why do you carry white viola powder", "75:24", "over international borders with you yeah", "75:27", "do you ever get tweaked on never it's", "75:28", "weird I mean I have like my upgraded", "75:31", "whey protein and collagen powder and and", "75:34", "like all kinds of stuff that I mean I", "75:35", "should look like I'm carrying kilos of", "75:36", "random stuff but no one ever asked you", "75:38", "to chest it or they never actually one", "75:41", "time I've had my whey protein tested", "75:42", "more often they check my coffee because", "75:44", "I don't drink Hotel coffee it makes me", "75:46", "feel crappy I just really my coffee so I", "75:48", "bring it with me just like you know", "75:50", "beans or ground-up coffee every time", "75:51", "that well what's that and then they open", "75:52", "it and they seems like they just want to", "75:54", "smell it maybe I don't know well it is", "75:56",
