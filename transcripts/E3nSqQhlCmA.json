out loud and it doesn't let", "82:34", "all the outside bullshit get in the way", "82:39", "of pulling the trigger the right way", "82:41", "right yeah that if you can actually have", "82:44", "a communication line with yourself while", "82:47", "it's happening yeah it keeps you in the", "82:48", "present moment you're utilizing the", "82:50", "equipment it's not in charge of you yes",

to", "83:13", "expect people to do that though you know", "83:14", "like I say that when I've helped people", "83:18", "learn how to base jump like you need to", "83:20", "be focused on what you're doing because", "83:23", "you're in charge of all the actions like", "83:25", "this isn't happening to you you've", "83:27", "chosen to let this happen right it's the", "83:30", "same thing with shooting a gun drawing a", "83:32", "bow they're all very similar we're like", "83:36", "you were saying like doing a kick right", "83:37", "yeah and not letting rogue elements", "83:39", "become part of the process", "83:41", "mm yeah it's some it's a weird thing", "83:46", "that your mind does where your mind just", "83:48", "wants to spaz out like it's yeah it's", "83:51", "it's a weird reaction to stress an", "83:53", "adrenalin and all these different things", "83:55", "different factors are you trying to", "83:57", "calculate all at once go full-on bananas", "83:59", "people is there shit I tell them only", "84:02", "imagine what it's like in combat yeah", "84:05", "that's a different level beyond yeah it", "84:11", "is so what are you telling them to think", "84:14", "of when you're telling them like we", "84:16", "teach in combat pistols and you teach", "84:18", "them how to utilize a pistol what do you", "84:21", "what what is the process of like I try", "84:24", "and break stuff down as simple as", "84:25", "possible so that it's easy steps for", "84:29", "people to talk through to create a habit", "84:31", "so that you're using it as a", "84:34", "subconscious effort right like I want", "84:36", "you to be able to draw and fire that", "84:38", "pistol or shoulder and fire the rifle in", "84:42", "a way that you're almost not thinking", "84:45", "through once you become very proficient", "84:48", "at the shooting so that your brain can", "84:51", "stay open to all the other pertinent", "84:53", "shit that's going on all the scary crap", "84:55", "that's happening out there right so it", "84:57", "becomes an automatic movement you want", "84:59", "it to be like that you want it to be an", "85:01", "automatic movement and there's guys out", "85:03", "there with a shit ton more combat time", "85:05", "and a shit ton more teaching experience", "85:08", "that say the exact same thing and they", "85:09", "say it because it works because there's", "85:12", "not time to screw around with having to", "85:16", "think through the process it's similar", "85:19", "to how you're drawing a bone hunting", "85:21", "right give time to really think through", "85:23", "it all not with an animal walking out in", "85:26", "front you know you have to already had", "85:28", "that stuff it's gotta be doubled in yeah", "85:30", "yeah super dialed so with pistol and", "85:34", "rifle it's the same way like I'm gonna", "85:35", "break that down so simple and we can", "85:39", "only handle so much information so I'll", "85:41", "break it down real simple and then feed", "85:42", "you more pieces individually as they", "85:46", "come up", "85:47", "now how much in the military how much", "85:50", "time do they spend instructing or", "85:53", "coaching Pia", "85:55", "on how to how to think during intense", "85:59", "and stressful situations so they system", "86:01", "but they started to do more of that when", "86:03", "I was in buds so

so much right", "99:31", "and I don't think that that's because", "99:32", "they don't care I think it's because", "99:33", "their their hormones are out of whack", "99:34", "that makes sense well there's also a lot", "99:38", "of guys whose hormones are out of whack", "99:40", "you know from IEDs and from oh man", "99:43", "letting down doors I I've been dumped", "99:48", "enough where like I

need to be doing", "100:17", "preventative work yes ahead of time yes", "100:21", "and then monitoring people making sure", "100:25", "that they're okay because that stuff is", "100:27", "degenerative and people need to know", "100:29", "that that's out there and it can be", "100:32", "helped is it hard sometimes for veterans", "100:35", "to ask for help I think so", "100:37", "because they just feel like maybe asking", "100:39", "shows a weakness or maybe they just it's", "100:42", "just too difficult to reach out I think", "100:44", "I think it's the too difficult to reach", "100:45", "out and I don't want to be the problem", "100:47", "or there must be guys that are worse", "100:49", "than me I think it's usually that it's", "100:51", "not necessarily the the fully inflated", "100:53", "ego of I'm just gonna be a hard-ass but", "100:55", "less which it there is you know that's", "100:57", "out there but I think it's a lot of guys", "100:59", "that are like now there's probably",

you're", "101:09", "lucky so you feel maybe like you", "101:12", "shouldn't be asking for help other", "101:13", "people need help more like I don't need", "101:15", "that seat at the table let me go find", "101:16", "somebody else for it that the lack of", "101:20", "support when veterans return is really", "101:24", "disturbing like the idea that there's so", "101:25", "much emphasis put into training", "101:27", "there's so much emphasis put into arming", "101:30", "and and making sure that everybody's", "101:31", "geared up", "101:32", "you're a multi-million dollar machine", "101:34", "yeah but then when you get back they", "101:36", "don't have a use for you anymore your", "101:37", "use tire fuck now it's getting better", "101:42", "and a lot of the outside groups do a", "101:43", "really good job but it's tough to", "101:47", "realize that there's outside groups that", "101:49", "are doing that job yes a lot of its guys", "101:53", "like what's the Fed doing right right", "101:55", "thanks guys", "101:56", "it's almost like there's no pressure on", "101:58", "them to resolve some of these issues or", "102:01", "to help when you come back is there any", "102:05", "coaching do they give you any sort of", "102:08", "advice um I didn't end up going to any", "102:11", "of that and they always tell you hey if", "102:14", "you need to talk to somebody

into hunting", "158:07", "especially if they have a good social", "158:09", "media profile like you do like they", "158:11", "start thinking like maybe they should", "158:12", "like film hunts and that could be like", "158:14", "it's a weird thing right because it", "158:16", "becomes a part of what you're doing to", "158:19", "sort of expand your social media profile", "158:22", "yeah so then

"be famous too only because I'm filming", "158:46", "these hunts and then also the filming", "158:48", "thing the real problem is that person", "158:50", "filming you is also in the way yeah like", "158:52", "there's an extra body moving there's", "158:54", "extra smells there's extra sounds", "158:56", "they have to move to get the shot and", "158:59", "sometimes like you're drawn on an animal", "159:01", "and they don't have the shot so they", "159:02", "move in order to get a better angle the", "159:04", "animals like what the fuck is that yeah", "159:06", "and the animal sees them and takes off", "159:07", "that's and more power to guys like dud", "159:10", "they're able to do it successfully", "159:10", "uh-huh", "159:11", "it's phenomenal yeah but it also takes a", "159:14",
