know the", "168:35", "answer to this particular question you", "168:37", "could look it out now no no no I'm not", "168:39", "no no you could go to college okay you", "168:42", "could get a professor you could find any", "168:44", "number of people that have the answers", "168:46", "could show you how to study them could", "168:48", "prove the test to you could lay it out", "168:50", "could give you all these instructions so", "168:52", "you could go do it on your own without", "168:54", "anybody I don't care about it that much", "168:55", "then why then why again then just just", "168:58",
