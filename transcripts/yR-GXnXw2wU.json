"what's their sources", "67:59", "are you going to send journalists out in", "68:00", "the field you know and who are these", "68:01", "journalists and what what's their", "68:03", "qualifications and how much they", "68:04", "understand about which subject they're", "68:06", "covering well i think that is a great", "68:07", "you know the great uh myth um i mean it", "68:10", "was never", "68:11", "you never had 100 objectivity right i", "68:13", "mean it just never happened because of", "68:15", "some of the reasons you're talking about", "68:16", "it's just like with with", "68:17", "uh intelligence reporting right it was", "68:19", "it once you get the raw intelligence off", "68:22", "the street", "68:22", "right you can have a an asset tell you", "68:25", "something", "68:26", "all right and that moment it's just raw", "68:28", "intelligence it doesn't have a right or", "68:30", "a left or whatever", "68:31", "it hasn't been through the spin cycle", "68:33", "and then but once that intelligence gets", "68:35", "reported back to headquarters", "68:37", "and then it starts getting its way", "68:38", "through uh the analysts right and then", "68:40", "it makes its way to", "68:42", "you know others outside of the agency if", "68:44", "we're talking about the agency", "68:45", "and it starts getting to uh the nsc you", "68:48", "know and every", "68:49", "by the time it finishes getting through", "68:51", "all those different cycles", "68:52", "yeah there's a spin to it right you've", "68:54", "lost that so", "68:55", "yeah to your point you're yeah you're", "68:57", "absolutely right you put", "68:59", "uh reporters out in the field they're", "69:00", "gonna have a bias as to who they talk to", "69:02", "yeah right", "69:03", "and those people are gonna have a

"develop it's like cyber warfare you know", "77:23", "initially it's defensive and now you", "77:25", "think okay now we gotta figure out how", "77:26", "to make it", "77:27", "work on our behalf and sometimes it's", "77:29", "important like when they shut down the", "77:30", "iran nuclear program", "77:32", "yeah with a virus essentially a computer", "77:35", "virus", "77:35", "absolutely and

one", "81:07", "of the guys that was involved in this", "81:08", "uh uh he was with what used to be called", "81:12", "the federal bureau of", "81:13", "narcotics a guy named uh white george", "81:16", "white", "81:17", "um was you know involved in like the san", "81:20", "francisco", "81:21", "cat house and you know according to the", "81:23", "stories he'd sit there and you know with",

"you know audits uh of uh and again", "82:49", "you're talking about like 149 sub", "82:51", "projects of mk alter so you can imagine", "82:53", "each", "82:53", "sub project has its own accounting

were", "104:38", "ridiculed", "104:38", "but turned to be turned out to be", "104:40", "absolutely true one of the things that", "104:42", "he said", "104:42", "was that there was this element this",

office", "125:56", "so i think there's a potential for a lot", "125:59", "of people who may like the policies or", "126:02", "some of the policies and prefer them to", "126:04", "a hard left agenda or a left agenda", "126:07", "i think there's a chance for them to say", "126:09", "oh fuck it i just i'm too tired and i", "126:11", "i don't want that and maybe they'll look", "126:13", "at ed biden

some before that", "126:57", "but i think they're only supposed to", "126:58", "have three or something that's crazy", "127:00", "say that one more time 16 states could", "127:02", "be finished by

being done i i would be sure yeah", "154:38", "exactly exactly", "154:39", "i'm thinking like 50 years from now like", "154:41", "when we're like", "154:42", "is it ethical should we do this and you", "154:44", "have a bunch of senators debating it", "154:46", "meanwhile in china", "154:47", "they're fucking full steam ahead yeah", "154:50", "and i think", "154:50", "and here's where it's interesting is", "154:52", "because you know again people listening", "154:54", "or", "154:54", "there'll be some folks listening going", "154:56", "well you know come on fucking ethical", "154:57", "the u.s of course the u.s government's", "154:59", "doing it and", "155:00", "um but we are fundamentally different", "155:03", "yes mk altruist as we were talking about", "155:05", "it yeah that was a horrendous you know", "155:07", "uh situation right went right off the", "155:10", "rails", "155:10", "uh shouldn't happen uh was exposed right", "155:14", "which is all by itself uh an indication",

in in you know uh in their in", "155:28", "in their committee hearings you know", "155:29", "they're going to call to the carpet the", "155:31", "pla intel", "155:32", "operators and say well what have you", "155:33", "been doing oh my god this is terrible or", "155:35", "the russians are going to do that", "155:36", "putin's going to call the fsb", "155:37", "and and throw them out there in a in a", "155:40", "committee hearing no bullshit so when", "155:43", "people want to talk about how the u.s is", "155:45", "engaging well okay yeah we've been off", "155:48", "the rails at times", "155:49", "we do tend to try to self-correct", "155:50", "whichever administration's in charge", "155:52", "but uh more importantly we do", "155:56", "have and we've you know and i hope we", "155:58", "maintain it we have had a track record", "156:00", "of transparency", "156:02", "to yeah again to you know compare it to", "156:04", "our is it 100 transparent no should it", "156:06", "be no", "156:07", "but compared to our", "156:10", "those others yeah we're we do a pretty", "156:12", "good job yeah", "156:13", "yeah so i i would agree um so this", "156:16", "remote viewing", "156:19", "did they ever get anything out of it was", "156:20", "there any data", "156:22", "that was there anybody was there ever", "156:24", "anyone who was really good at it", "156:26", "or better at it was there anything to it", "156:28", "no", "156:29", "so how does it still how's this still a", "156:30", "subject it captures the imagination", "156:33", "right i mean it's it's", "156:34", "it's like how is manson still a subject", "156:36", "well he's fascinating and it was a", "156:37", "fascinating period of time", "156:38", "remote viewing is i think it's it's", "156:41", "fascinating it's kind of it's again it's", "156:43", "like", "156:43", "so it's like psychics they wanted to", "156:45", "find like don't don't police still", "156:47", "actually use", "156:47", "psychics for certain like like they try", "156:49", "to find bodies and shit", "156:52", "is that a mystery mystery tv show or", "156:56", "pbs or something i don't know you always", "156:57", "hear about it i guess please bring in", "156:59", "sidekicks i mean", "157:00", "really yeah i don't know um you know a a", "157:04", "very uh very good friend of mine who was", "157:06", "uh homicide detective in", "157:07", "in the uk's uh met police uh he works", "157:10", "with me now in in uh", "157:12", "in my business diligence diligence usa", "157:14", "for all your information and security", "157:16", "needs", "157:17", "um he um never talked about", "157:20", "a psychic ever being brought in and he", "157:22", "handled a lot of", "157:23", "cases yeah but when i i had asked him", "157:27", "about that by disappointed but bring it", "157:28", "up because i asked him", "157:29", "no", "157:34", "i don't believe so uh but uh", "157:37", "yeah i nothing really i mean again maybe", "157:40", "there's a file", "157:41", "sitting in the retired records office of", "157:43", "the agency you know and we're never", "157:45", "going to see it", "157:46", "um but uh as far as i've", "157:49", "seen there was never any um", "157:52", "record of success from it but it is i", "157:55", "get why", "157:56", "it's of interest and and why people are", "157:58", "fascinated by it", "157:59", "that makes sense yeah i mean it's like", "158:01", "everything else it's like", "158:03", "i guess the government had to find out", "158:05", "whether or not mk", "158:06", "ultra like when they were doing that", "158:07", "like let's see there's only one way to", "158:10", "find out", "158:11", "well if you don't believe in it at all", "158:13", "but it turns out to be true", "158:14", "and there are a few people that have", "158:15", "developed techniques like look hypnosis", "158:18", "is real hypnosis is weird", "158:20", "you know maybe there's something to this", "158:21", "shit maybe if you just", "158:23", "follow the right techniques and get", "158:24", "yourself in the right mindset you have", "158:26", "access to information that's not", "158:27", "available any other way", "158:28", "and hypnosis again was part of the mk", "158:30", "ultra sub projects right", "158:32", "and it's because there was concern that", "158:35", "you know", "158:35", "the enemy had this research or that they", "158:39", "were making headway", "158:40", "and so again a lot of things that", "158:42", "develop initially", "158:44", "it's because it's a defensive response", "158:45", "because we learned something about what", "158:47", "uh some hostile entity is doing and", "158:51", "then you have to move immediately to", "158:53", "okay well do we need this for offensive", "158:55", "purposes because if they're doing it", "158:56", "do we need to have that capability right", "158:58", "so and i'd always argue with with", "159:00", "certainly you go into the realm of cyber", "159:02", "warfare yeah you better have that", "159:03", "capability", "159:04", "uh you know both sides well that's where", "159:06", "things like that neural link", "159:08", "technology is very interesting because", "159:10", "if it really if if somehow or another", "159:12", "you really can communicate with someone", "159:13", "who's not there without using any words", "159:16", "which is what elon said to me because", "159:18", "you're going to be able to talk without", "159:19", "using words well if you can do that", "159:21", "at a distance like if you can literally", "159:23", "guide someone like if say if you got", "159:25", "someone", "159:26", "who's on a mission in afghanistan and", "159:29", "you", "159:29", "you are watching on a satellite and you", "159:31", "can
