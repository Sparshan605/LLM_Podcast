what is disturbing", "08:04", "to me is that his knee-jerk reaction to", "08:06", "this without having any research at all", "08:08", "in the subject not knowing at all about", "08:10", "gobekli tepe which was discovered in", "08:12", "what the 90s", "08:13", "yeah 96 I mean so this is to me this is", "08:16", "something that I've looked at because of", "08:17", "you guys in great depth when I read your", "08:20", "book I was just completely enthralled", "08:22", "with this idea of history having some", "08:24", "sort of or rise and fall and", "08:27", "civilization having these resets so

skeptic", "08:37", "professional insurer but many people who", "08:39", "question anything that's outside of what", "08:41", "they've been told as soon as they hear", "08:43", "any sort of a theory outside of what", "08:45", "they were told they immediately call", "08:46", "quackery happy anything and this but", "08:48", "it's it's a weird knee-jerk reaction to", "08:50", "something especially

real", "09:17", "situation that this this solar system", "09:21", "you know at least as far as we know the", "09:23", "only solar system has to deal with this", "09:25", "but we know this is a real

about", "09:49", "to come full circle is the recognition", "09:51", "that these kinds of catastrophes have", "09:53", "also influenced the rise and fall of", "09:54", "civilization and a lot more a lot more", "09:59", "extremely than then has been recognized", "10:01", "up to this point and while geologists", "10:03", "and earth scientists are looking at the", "10:05", "surface of the earth and

going to hit the", "10:39", "earth in the next hundred years well", "10:41", "yeah that's true but what about all the", "10:42", "ones they haven't counted which are", "10:44", "estimated to run into hundreds of", "10:46", "thousands and which haven't been seen", "10:47", "yet and what happens is we see them", "10:49", "roughly ten days before they pass the", "10:52", "earth that is not enough

always", "11:41", "goes our civilization always goes for", "11:42", "the where weather where the money's to", "11:45", "be made but yeah if we can mine", "11:46", "asteroids we can move asteroids and and", "11:49", "the technology is there and ironically", "11:51", "the most dangerous asteroids are going", "11:53", "to be the ones that are the closest to", "11:55", "the earth which are the most

the", "45:16", "Sicily channel so um what what are the", "45:19", "biggest pieces down there is it this", "45:21", "right here is this way yeah that big", "45:23", "thing big thing there I'm 30 feet long I", "45:25", "think and is it what what leads you to", "45:28", "believe that this is man-made the", "45:31", "scientists who worked on it the fact", "45:32", "that there are holes drilled

that", "47:20", "thing up like this and put those citing", "47:23", "holes through it would look precisely", "47:26", "like scrape the barnacles off of it you", "47:29", "know and no one's saying oh

further and", "47:39", "that's the whole point of all this is", "47:40", "all of this stuff needs more research it", "47:43", "doesn't need some Cavalier dismissal by", "47:46", "somebody who's you know protecting their", "47:49", "their own paradigm it needs more", "47:51", "research on all fronts I mean because I", "47:54", "think that there's enough evidence it is", "47:55", "now accumulated

eleven", "77:40", "thousand six hundred years ago that's", "77:42", "the period that just immediately", "77:43", "precedes what mainstream academia think", "77:47", "of as the very beginnings of",

those things what what a", "107:03", "bizarre concept now these pyramids so", "107:06", "this one that this this Emperor was", "107:09", "buried and that had the terracotta army", "107:11", "was that a pyramid as well it is a", "107:13", "period it is absolutely it's a man-made", "107:15", "pyramid the Terracotta Army was buried", "107:18", "around its edges not in the pyramid", "107:21", "itself

the that's", "108:01", "the problem I think with archaeology and", "108:03", "it's why we have to you know consider", "108:05", "another way we're looking at an image of", "108:07", "the Terracotta

they had a couple of them", "108:18", "they brought some of them they came to", "108:20", "the British Museum there were a number", "108:21", "of museums Lee but it's so much bigger", "108:22", "than I thought it was you know I mean", "108:24", "there's I mean how many there's", "108:26", "thousands yes thousands of these", "108:27", "terracotta figures absolutely and this", "108:30", "period was made out of what was it Stone", "108:32", "round earth mainly okay so they just", "108:35", "sort of shaped the ground they just dug", "108:38", "around yeah they brought in earth and", "108:40", "turn it into a pyramidal Mound over the", "108:42", "but it wasn't just it's not massive", "108:44", "stone blocks it's not massive stuff", "108:46", "that's why they can grow crops on the", "108:47", "sides of some of these pyramid weird", "108:49", "yeah so they wouldn't build these giant", "108:51", "mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him", "108:54", "and support him well they probably", "108:56", "created the interior", "108:57", "you know subterranean as they were", "108:59", "building the whole thing mmm and they", "109:02", "just stacked dirt on top of it yeah wow", "109:04", "what a weird way to make a house yeah", "109:06", "and then we have to consider this with", "109:07", "you know with with archaeological sites", "109:10", "all all around the world is that any", "109:12", "site may actually not be the product of", "109:14", "just one culture but may have been", "109:15", "reworked and worked over and used by", "109:17", "many different cultures over this is", "109:19", "different periods stunning to me um I", "109:21", "found out about this because of a friend", "109:23", "of John Anthony West who was here with", "109:25", "him he showed me he lives in China and", "109:26", "he showed me some video of it and I was", "109:28", "like how do I not know about this I had", "109:30", "no idea there's this many of them also", "109:32", "here's one that's exposed what's this", "109:35", "controversial ancient pyramids of China", "109:38", "that one looks exposed blocky yeah well", "109:41", "that is a another thing about China that", "109:44",

"109:56", "the country was established it's not", "109:57", "really that long ago", "109:58", "you're dealing with China you're dealing", "110:00", "with literally thousands of years of", "110:02",

it's kind of behind right I mean", "110:15", "they're behind environmentally they're", "110:17", "behind when it comes to human rights", "110:18", "consider this the Portuguese in the late", "110:23", "1400s have rounded the Cape of Good Hope", "110:26", "and they've entered the Indian Ocean in", "110:28", "their little ships they've entered the", "110:30", "Indian Ocean and they actually establish", "110:33", "a huge Empire they go to Malacca they go", "110:36", "all over the place okay the seas are", "110:37", "open to them if they had come forty", "110:40", "years earlier they would

these huge fleets", "110:57", "carrying incredibly precious gifts silks", "110:59", "and ceramics and they took them all", "111:02", "around the Indian Ocean and they just", "111:03", "gave them to people so off the coast of", "111:06", "East Africa and in East Africa you can", "111:07", "find remains of this pottery from this", "111:09", "episode and then a Chinese emperor", "111:11", "came along and he closed the doors", "111:14", "burned all the boats shut everything", "111:17", "down and didn't let anybody speak to", "111:19", "China for 200 years whoa what a dick", "111:22", "well he he felt it was time for the", "111:24", "Chinese culture to turn inward yeah and", "111:27", "he they were afraid that they were that", "111:29", "their ancient culture on one and there", "111:31", "might have been maybe a laudable motive", "111:33", "in that they were concerned that the", "111:35", "ancient culture was going to get", "111:36", "contaminated by too much contact with", "111:39",

"from the chemists that come as Prairie", "111:58", "and what what is it please", "112:00", "unless let's let's have a look at you", "112:02", "got that this Chinese parents are still", "112:05", "blowing my mind", "112:06", "they blow my mind as well I just can't", "112:08", "believe they haven't been asked", "112:09", "it's an eerie spooky scene I would I", "112:11", "recommend anybody to go to SIA not just", "112:13", "just it's incredible how many of them", "112:15", "there are and how unexplained it all is", "112:19", "and it's again it feeds into my general", "112:21", "point is we don't remember our past what", "112:23", "are we looking at here okay let's let's", "112:25", "can we pause so I can talk about what", "112:27", "we're looking at", "112:28", "yeah you look at this one that way you", "112:29", "could hit the mic right in front yeah", "112:30", "okay this is the beginning but okay what", "112:32", "here's what really I mic right up to you", "112:33", "that we're looking at a place in western", "112:36", "Montana called Camas Prairie and you see", "112:38", "some hills in the foreground and you see", "112:40", "a basin in the background right okay", "112:43", "right here on top of this hill and down", "112:46", "on the side here you see that there are", "112:47", "some coring operations those are coring", "112:49", "gravel because everything you're looking", "112:52", "at here this whole landscape between the", "112:54", "hills are these large masses of gravel", "112:56", "trillions of tons of gravel now what", "113:00", "we're going to do is we're going to", "113:01", "start sweeping around as the video plays", "113:03", "and you're going to load us down here a", "113:05", "series of ripples okay I see that okay", "113:10", "and I'm going to have Jamie pause in a", "113:11", "second but let's keep coming around you", "113:14", "start seeing the ripples on your", "113:15", "landscape let's pause right there right", "113:20", "there let's pause now I wish I had a", "113:22", "pointer but if you look up you're going", "113:24", "to see a flat", "113:25", "piece of land like a tongue coming out", "113:27", "rounded out Jamie's right here", "113:36", "that's it gets you a laser that's a", "113:38", "delta", "113:39", "that's a delta you know what a delta is", "113:41", "you ever heard of the Delta it's when a", "113:44", "river comes into a body of water and", "113:46", "it's carrying sediment and because the", "113:49", "river is moving along swiftly it's", "113:51", "carrying the sediment but when it comes", "113:52", "into the standing body of water it slows", "113:55", "down and it drops its sediment it builds", "113:57", "a Delta the whole city of Portland for", "113:59", "example is built on a giant Delta all", "114:02", "right", "114:02", "New Orleans is built on the Delta right", "114:05", "okay so what we're seeing there is a", "114:07", "Delta and then in front of it we're", "114:09", "seeing rippled landscape let's keep", "114:13", "coming around Jamie and so enfold", "114:15", "landscape that looks exactly like the", "114:16", "beach looks yeah keep coming around with", "114:18", "us the thing is fractal because this", "114:20", "this is the whole mystery of this that", "114:22", "this happens at a scale of inches on", "114:24", "beaches and a scale of hundreds of feet", "114:25", "here stop again okay Lord now right here", "114:29", "in the middle you see a massive Delta", "114:31", "yes you know like a big tongue splayed", "114:33", "out and then right down here you start", "114:35", "seeing the ripples and there's a", "114:37", "farmhouse you see the farmhouse then now", "114:41", "those ripples are the tallest ones are", "114:44", "about the height of a five-story", "114:45", "building whoa how does our keep okay", "114:50", "let's keep keep sweet swinging around", "114:52", "stop it stop this for a second um if you", "114:55", "don't mind are these things they're the", "114:57", "size of a five-story building what is", "114:58", "that like 70 feet or something", "115:00", "50 feet okay so that's those are 50 feet", "115:03", "high and how much water will we'll get", "115:06", "to that let's see let's see the rest of", "115:09", "it and these are just dirt right there", "115:11", "there well if you dig into one what", "115:13", "you're going to find is they're they're", "115:15", "a massive okay let's pause the game look", "115:19", "at this this is crazy this is totally", "115:21", "crazy this is one of the craziest things", "115:23",

would", "157:46", "never have thought so that was obviously", "157:49", "created by water pouring through that's", "157:51", "the problem is because we haven't had", "157:53", "the scale of perception

whole different", "158:54", "perspective and and now you can see see", "158:57", "they see the man standing right down", "158:59", "there on the rock no you see all that", "159:02", "little dude yeah yeah little that little", "159:05", "dude is 6 feet tall he's not that", "159:07", "liveable I mean on the pictures little", "159:09", "no no in July we are 4 inches it's it's", "159:15", "it's an illusion what's the me stunning", "159:17", "that we knew this is really beautiful", "159:19", "and cool and everything like that but", "159:20", "what's really stunning is the initial", "159:22", "picture where it becomes so obvious that", "159:24", "above picture we see the farmland and", "159:26", "that just it's so obviously cut cut", "159:29", "sliced out of the lens let's see the", "159:31", "rest of it then as the drone flies over", "159:34", "yeah so and then we have what's called", "159:37", "classic scab land you see all these", "159:39", "mounds these kind of lumps that's what", "159:42", "are the scabs on the scab land that's", "159:44", "why it's called scab land and again it's", "159:46", "flooding that causes it plucking slifer", "159:48", "entually plucking

"159:59", "there you get a sense of the rock blade", "160:02", "well there you get a sense of what the", "160:04", "volume of water muscle looked like when", "160:06", "it was rushing through there right and", "160:07", "see this is just holy shit we've looked", "160:10", "at two features now Camas Prairie and", "160:12", "potholes cataract we could sit here for", "160:15", "the next 10 hours looking at dozens and", "160:18", "dozens of these mega features and you", "160:20", "look at there's a whole bar this is a", "160:23", "gravel bar down here over there okay see", "160:26", "see the giant ribs on it you see those", "160:29", "yeah I've never seen those reported in", "160:31", "the literature it may be that nobody's", "160:33", "ever seek really seen him before or no", "160:35", "one's ever paid attention", "160:36", "nobody's ever paid a tip but there they", "160:38", "are so how what is mainstream science", "160:40", "use to describe this this sort of or", "160:42", "mainstream archaeology used to describe", "160:45", "these features this would be geology", "160:46", "well Karis an archeology yeah what would", "160:50", "they so they believe this catastrophic",

kind of", "160:59", "timeline are these geologists putting on", "161:01", "us Oh two or three thousand years yeah", "161:03", "and why do they think that well because", "161:06", "of the the ice dammed model and how much", "161:09", "time it would take see it gets", "161:11", "complicated and because until the comet", "161:14", "research there was no credible source of", "161:17", "heat that could melt that amount of ice", "161:19", "and cause out now that's the new factor", "161:21", "that's come into the equation now you", "161:23", "look at look at the people standing on", "161:25", "the cliff edge they're the edge of the", "161:26", "rock would you see them down there", "161:28", "yeah so now you get the sense of scale", "161:30", "what would survive again in the", "161:33", "aftermath not that dude something no not", "161:35", "that dude not a dude or his buddies yeah", "161:40", "this is a crazy place man it's crazy to", "161:42", "look at it's just so when you were", "161:45", "looking above it I gave in here I mean", "161:47", "you get a sense of it but if you would", "161:49", "just show this to me quite honestly I", "161:51", "probably wouldn't piece that together", "161:54", "but when you look at it the original", "161:56", "image it's so blatantly obvious right", "161:58", "well that's that's the thing now is we", "162:00", "are in this position

did", "172:11", "you have what's called no one can hear", "172:13", "you if you do this just just tell me", "172:15", "where it is I get it okay so there's the", "172:18", "to scab land tracks right

"177:06", "this point nobody disputes that there", "177:08", "were catastrophic floods the question is", "177:10", "what was the mechanism how many were", "177:12", "there how long and so long how

minute wait a minute", "178:16", "wait a minute what and the the idea in", "178:18", "my mind that this whole thing was", "178:21", "covered just 12,000 years ago that seems", "178:24", "so incredibly recent by the way that ice", "178:27", "was more like two miles deep could", "178:30", "consider the weight of those ice masses", "178:31", "pressing down I mean anything that was", "178:33", "there

were saying or it's", "185:09", "fractal the interesting thing about", "185:11", "water erosion and sedimentation is it's", "185:13", "scale invariant so you can look at", "185:15", "features and

"185:32", "otherwise it's hard to get a sense of", "185:33", "the scale of what you're looking at", "185:35", "right so my question though was that if", "185:38", "that's the case if you could drain", "185:40", "Niagara Falls and it would have a", "185:42", "similar feature set to what you're", "185:44", "seeing on the ground there well we know", "185:46", "that Niagara Falls has been doing that",

few", "185:54", "weeks right but how do we know that well", "185:56", "for one thing to scale of it because if", "185:58", "it because in other words how long would", "186:01", "it take", "186:01",

"186:13", "would never look like if you drained it", "186:15", "though what would it look like an", "186:16", "equivalent to any of these things for", "186:18", "you well right here for one thing it's", "186:19", "not basalt bedrock so you're not going", "186:21", "to see quite the same type of erosion", "186:23", "because really what you what you've got", "186:24", "to consider is that all different rock", "186:26", "types are Road differently right also", "186:29", "you know what happens is you have", "186:31", "teams of flow so that what you have in", "186:34", "Niagara today is a lower flow regime", "186:37", "which doesn't have anywhere near the", "186:39", "type of turbulence or erosive potential", "186:42", "is when you get water moving at 50 or 60", "186:45", "miles an hour", "186:46", "one reason we definitely can know that", "186:48", "this is the case is because we see the", "186:51", "association with the giant current", "186:52", "ripples we see the boulders that have", "186:55", "been plucked and quarried and some of", "186:57", "them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter you", "186:59", "see and we'll look at some of those", "187:01", "coming up in the next

cliff wall of this giant", "187:37", "cataract is about 400 feet high and then", "187:39", "you see the beginning of the blade rock", "187:41", "out there and the full extent of the", "187:44", "thing actually goes all the way to the", "187:46", "horizon but we can't see that beyond", "187:49", "there but this erosion goes all the way", "187:50", "to the horizon to stone that cut into", "187:53",

up", "188:07", "by a couple of hundred feet of topsoil", "188:09", "and then that was exposed when the", "188:11", "floods came through go to the next 1018", "188:17", "and you'll see an example of

there is 30 and 40", "188:30", "feet those would be like four-story", "188:32", "buildings down there so those are just", "188:34", "washed away by this gigantic river", "188:37", "that's just this this right this massive", "188:39", "gigantic river moving 50 60 miles an", "188:41", "hour sweeps through there plucks and", "188:44", "Aires the bedrock and then when the", "188:46", "spigots

"189:04", "two and three hundred feet thick and", "189:06", "three miles long and they're all in it", "189:08", "so see here's the answer to your", "189:10", "question is and this is what how Brett's", "189:13", "finally did it was by showing that it", "189:14", "was the full suite of evidence taken", "189:17", "integrally that created a picture that", "189:20", "was undeniable to the skeptics it was", "189:22", "just it was overwhelming because it was", "189:24", "every piece fit together too perfectly", "189:27", "to ignores no other explanation other", "189:30", "than gigantic

"189:52", "it's like you feel like a be fine", "189:54", "but maybe not if something like this", "189:56", "happens again well you have to ask what", "189:58", "what could be the change in you know in", "190:00", "the human orientation to life on this", "190:02", "planet like for example I remember the", "190:05", "first Earth Day 1970 right when when", "190:08", "this consciousness about hey

and that", "192:30", "exceptional that there's something that", "192:32", "from time to time and see here's the", "192:35", "thing this is completely removed from", "192:37", "the glaciers any water

one thought which is", "192:46", "not it is not a disconnected element", "192:48", "because because of the massive rain out", "192:51", "that was that resulted from the impacts", "192:53", "on the ice

you look at it as a clock at about 8", "193:25", "o'clock you can see a breach of Valley", "193:28", "coming off you see that you know Jamie", "193:31", "can you yeah right there", "193:33", "that was the spillover so at the same", "193:36", "time now get this at the same window of", "193:39", "time that this these flood events are", "193:42", "happening up in Washington and Idaho and", "193:44",

two different flood regimes and I'm", "203:39", "going to document all I'm writing all", "203:41", "this up in detail as a like as a thesis", "203:44", "to explain my interpretation of the", "203:48",

"203:58", "so compelling she's so amazing like just", "204:00", "this image itself is just wow what would", "204:03", "what kind of power and force would it", "204:06", "take to create those ripples those 50", "204:08", "foot high ripples all over the place", "204:10", "miles and miles and miles of the", "204:12", "yeah and and see nothing since that", "204:14", "event has really affected them they're", "204:16", "still sitting there's these gigantic", "204:18", "monstrous fossil features in the", "204:20", "landscape now when they do core samples", "204:22", "on that stuff what do they find out like", "204:23", "as far as the dating of it like if they", "204:25", "get bottom one of those ripples well", "204:27", "you've got to find a lot you've got to", "204:29", "be able to find organic material right", "204:31", "in there and to the extent that there's", "204:33", "organic material it basically all dates", "204:36", "from the end of the Ice Age the problem", "204:37", "is is when you have a flood like this", "204:39", "coming through it's sweeping up", "204:41", "everything in its path including forests", "204:43", "and animals so if you've got a bone in", "204:46",

"204:55", "messed up kij chaotic mess it's not like", "204:59", "you could just go dig into the side of", "205:00", "that hill at that same level and find", "205:02", "something that's organic and absolutely", "205:04", "dated to that because that's all stone", "205:05", "right right it's boulders it is if you", "205:08", "saw a cross-section of one of those", "205:09", "ripples it's it's just a jumbled chaotic", "205:12", "mess of everything from finest sand and", "205:15", "silt up to boulders the size of cars and", "205:17", "even houses and stuff just yeah that's", "205:20", "so crazy go to 10:41 and we'll see an", "205:23", "interesting artist rendition by edward", "205:28", "Riau who did all the illustrations for", "205:30", "the jewels original Jules Verne books", "205:32", "and

and this is", "206:19", "basically another key piece of evidence", "206:22", "is strewn for thousands of square miles", "206:25", "throughout the", "206:25", "out of the flood you have these gigantic", "206:27", "boulders and these are being carried", "206:30", "aboard icebergs let me let me describe", "206:32", "what we're looking at right now because", "206:33", "as a person is that you there I took the", "206:36", "picture so it's two of my fellow", "206:38", "travelers", "206:39", "okay normal sized people and you know", "206:41", "whatever six feet tall and and bounce", "206:44", "them on top of each other", "206:46", "12:18 you're looking at probably at", "206:50", "least 35 40 feet tall right now yeah and", "206:53", "and wider wider than it is tall oh yeah", "206:56", "60 feet wide does that's insane and that", "206:59", "was carried by water it was carried it", "207:01", "was carried on icebergs yeah in the", "207:03", "water oh my god so this one this flood", "207:06", "is not just water it's it's a huge", "207:08", "thousands of icebergs it's forests up by", "207:11", "their boots it's a jumbling massive", "207:13", "powerful erosive flow amazing thousands", "207:17", "of megafauna are done doubt in fact a", "207:19", "lot of the there have been a lot of", "207:22", "mammoth remains found in missoula flood", "207:25", "sediments they're generally in the", "207:26", "Willamette Valley okay let's go to the", "207:29", "next image there we go this is I like", "207:32", "out in the middle of the Prairie again", "207:34", "you got thousands of these things I'll", "207:36", "tell you what I'm a chicken I wouldn't", "207:37", "stand right there I think that thing's", "207:39", "gonna roll on top of you that would be a", "207:41", "wrap son yeah this is known as Yeager", "207:44", "raw that thing's huge", "207:46", "and is that you want to eat there no", "207:48", "that's one of my try took the pictures", "207:50", "tell him stand there yeah I said stand", "207:51", "there and I had the other guys go around", "207:53", "the back", "207:54", "Rock Bush I this thing is kind of", "207:57", "hanging off the side of that hill the", "207:59", "way some of those Hollywood Hills houses", "208:01", "are uh-huh on stilts see that that that", "208:04", "rounded mass of stuff that it's sitting", "208:06", "in is called a Berg Mound", "208:07", "and you see these icebergs are not clean", "208:10", "ice they're dirty they're filled with", "208:11", "gravel and debris so in a Berg when a", "208:14", "Berg that's being carried in the flood", "208:16", "and the floodwaters subside the Berg's", "208:18", "get stranded in the land they then melt", "208:21", "and if there's no Boulder there's just a", "208:24", "mound if there's no gigantic Boulder", "208:26", "there's just a mound but if there is a", "208:28", "gigantic Boulder being carried aboard", "208:30", "the iceberg it will be sitting in a berg", "208:33", "mound like you see right that's amazing", "208:35", "so that white line that we see was where", "208:37", "the iceberg was when it deposited that", "208:39", "thing than it just melted from there no", "208:41", "that's actually a bedding plane between", "208:43", "two different kinds of basalt so okay so", "208:46", "the mound itself below it is what you're", "208:49", "saying is the burgh mound that's the", "208:50", "Berg Mountain and the boulder the big", "208:52", "boulder was the cargo sitting on top of", "208:55", "the iceberg okay so the Berg is not just", "208:59", "water it's water with a bunch of dirt", "209:00", "and all kinds of other shit in as well", "209:01", "yeah and so when it melts that's what it", "209:03", "leaves behind it leaves bhai", "209:06", "that's amazing okay in the next image we", "209:09", "have the hancock array that you up there", "209:12", "well that's me on top of that back in", "209:13", "the eighteen thousand tunnel there once", "209:17", "you bryggen walk yeah I was I do that", "209:20", "from time to time but it but it it's an", "209:23", "amazing experience to stand there and to", "209:24", "think what transported this well we know", "209:26", "it was transported in an iceberg and it", "209:28", "was dumped there on the side of that", "209:29", "Valley and it's just the thought of", "209:31", "thousands of these things plowing along", "209:34", "at 60 or 70 miles an hour carried on a", "209:36", "gigantic flood how do we have anything", "209:39", "left you know no wonder no wonder we've", "209:42", "forgotten our past and say and here's", "209:43", "the thing I mean what we're doing here", "209:45", "is we're looking where these flood", "209:47", "events are preserved the most", "209:48", "spectacularly and the reason is is", "209:50", "because you had a very steep gradient", "209:52", "from the ice sheet elevation to the", "209:54", "Pacific Ocean", "209:55", "but like Graham and I when we traveled", "209:58", "across we traveled across the", "210:00", "Continental Divide and traveled from the", "210:03", "Rocky Mountains to the Twin Cities which", "210:05", "is on the Mississippi River

"looking on the scale of giants this is", "210:34", "this is beyond imagination what you look", "210:37", "at and and the only this the flood", "210:40", "explanation makes sense of it go to go", "210:42", "to 1:05 for Jamie and you'll see there", "210:49", "we go I'm down inside the pothole one of", "210:52", "the potholes", "210:52", "hanging up at gram so that's a pothole", "210:54",

to the YouTube please if you're", "211:19", "listening to this just go just you gotta", "211:22", "fast forward to this this is insane this", "211:24", "image is insane just thinking of", "211:26", "watching rocks spin around now reeling", "211:30", "into the ground and you're talking about", "211:31", "over a short period of time oh yeah", "211:33", "probably you know I'm guessing you know",

see it well you'd have had to be", "211:58", "in an orbit to survive it right yeah", "212:01", "even if you're flying over in a plane", "212:02", "probably they're just the atmospheric", "212:04",

"it seems to be both wind and water", "212:28", "deposited but I think the obvious", "212:31", "explanation for it is this that when you", "212:34", "see the like the top layers of the flood",
