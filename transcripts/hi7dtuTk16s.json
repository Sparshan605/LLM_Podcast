fundamentally sound but I", "07:44", "mean after he beat John Ruiz for the", "07:45", "heavyweight championship of the world", "07:47", "and I had been going to multiple Roy", "07:50", "fights leading up to that heavyweight", "07:51", "fight Antonio Tarver who have a lot of", "07:53", "respect for you know they were rivals in", "07:55", "Florida when they were young Antonio was", "07:59",

"08:06", "Roy became the heavyweight champion of", "08:08", "the world after being the middleweight", "08:10", "champion starting at 160 Terra Antonio", "08:14", "Tarver interrupted the press conference", "08:16", "he said Roy Jones you've been ducking me", "08:18", "you've been running he's going on and on", "08:20", "and on Roy looks at Tarver and and gives", "08:23", "him the attention that he's been after", "08:25", "and he said huh he said I'm a whoop you", "08:29", "I'm a whoop you we don't make that fight", "08:31", "happen and at that moment I'm thinking", "08:32", "like no Roy no don't do you're the", "08:35", "heavyweight champion of the world Tarver", "08:37", "was still light heavyweight and sure", "08:39", "enough right went down stripped off 25", "08:43", "pounds of muscle that he had built up", "08:45", "with Mac ISIL stone to get ready for the", "08:47", "heavyweight fight", "08:48", "went down there fought a close fight but", "08:50", "he didn't look like himself took the", "08:52", "rematch now even after the first fight", "08:54", "was Harvard", "08:55", "man you run for the hills you know what", "08:56", "I beat him I wet myself I'm going back", "08:58", "up took the rematch and then got knocked", "09:00", "out yeah I didn't that's where I thought", "09:03", "to read the first fight was earlier now", "09:05", "my brain scrambled here because I", "09:07", "thought that that was immediately after", "09:09", "the ruies fight that he got knocked out", "09:11", "yeah it was he went back down yes", "09:14", "so Ruiz light-heavyweight went down", "09:16", "fought over the first time they fought", "09:17", "the rematch they fought two times in a", "09:20", "row", "09:20", "they fought two times in a row and then", "09:22", "they ended up fighting a third time like", "09:23", "way down the road did they really I", "09:25", "didn't even know they fought a third", "09:26", "time in Florida the loss of the weight", "09:29", "was a terrible idea and also let's be", "09:32", "realistic about how we put that weight", "09:34", "on it's most likely there's some Mexican", "09:36", "supplements involved and if they are", "09:38", "gonna put that kind of bulk on you know", "09:40", "I mean I don't know yeah Roy Jones one", "09:42", "of my heroes there's not disrespect no I", "09:45", "hear you but and I've heard people say", "09:46", "stuff like that but like um that's my", "09:49", "guy like I'm a kid so I'm like not yet I", "09:52", "get it I'm believing that it was just", "09:54", "raw Mackie shield stone and hard work", "09:57", "it's possible it's possible but I mean", "10:00", "what is he like he was like 33 34 on it", "10:03", "very hard to put 25 pounds of muscle on", "10:07", "very well it didn't say he cut weight to", "10:10", "make the light heavyweight limit right", "10:11", "so you got to think he was probably like", "10:12", "185 190 probably yeah and so we really", "10:16", "only gained maybe 1015 pounds still he", "10:20", "was lean as fuck he was pretty lame it", "10:22", "seems to take though - Roy had it Roy", "10:23", "had that kind of bill oh he was strong", "10:26", "yeah very muscular I mean he had crazy", "10:28", "biceps and no tribe tips yeah it was all", "10:31", "just was weird right he had a crazy body", "10:34", "I didn't notice - dude his body was very", "10:37", "unusual the way he was built like he was", "10:40", "all biceps it was just whipping you know", "10:42", "he's just from whipping punches we don't", "10:44", "use Johnny shots", "10:45", "ya know he was phenomenal you got a", "10:46", "picture of him Jamie yeah that's my guy", "10:50", "no I listen I'm a gigantic Roy Jones jr.", "10:52", "fan but I mean I feel like like that's", "10:55", "there's one example right there you see", "10:57", "how gigantic his biceps are but you see", "10:59", "it almost more while he's fighting I", "11:01", "mean really had like a body built a hook", "11:03", "you know yeah what if Jones remained a", "11:05", "heavyweight", "11:06", "I mean look he was so goddamn", "11:08", "I mean John Ruiz just was within a tear", "11:10", "in that fight but his thing about the", "11:12", "after the Ruiz fight is you know we had", "11:13", "the same manager James Prince there was", "11:16", "a Tyson fight on the table and I believe", "11:20", "I'm accurate when I say this it was", "11:22", "somewhere around 40 million guaranteed", "11:24", "whoa", "11:25", "there's an upside to you stay at", "11:28", "heavyweight keep the weight on it Tyson", "11:30", "wasn't quite Tyson at that time we're", "11:31", "still dangerous but wasn't quite Tyson I", "11:33", "think they were working toward it from", "11:35", "what I've heard Roy wanted more money", "11:37", "James Prince was like bro take this 40", "11:40", "million there's going to be an upside as", "11:42", "you and Mike Tyson Roy Jones on Mike", "11:43", "Tyson Roy somehow said nope the fight", "11:46", "will be there later on down the road put", "11:47", "his attention toward Antonio Tarver the", "11:49", "rest is history", "11:49", "Wow I'm kind of glad in fight Tyson I", "11:53", "wanted

"Floyd was when he was younger in his", "73:25", "property there's no one who generates", "73:28", "that amount of eyes", "73:30", "okay nella fight could do something like", "73:32", "that it could but can I was talking", "73:34", "about fighting kovalev right but he", "73:35", "would he would he would stop talking", "73:37", "about finding Koval and start running", "73:38", "marathons if it was come today would be", "73:40", "in a couple of who-ville Floyd would", "73:42", "make him drop down like 145 pounds or", "73:44", "something crazy as he should", "73:47", "what did he make him fight at the first", "73:49", "I 152 or something like that", "73:50", "he came with some arbitrary number below", "73:53", "it was below junior middleweight I think", "73:55", "it was like 52 Oscar De La

side", "74:20", "though it seems like Canelo so huge", "74:23", "particularly the Mexican mean if they", "74:25", "were fight again yes if they fought", "74:26", "right now Floyd still the a plus but", "74:29", "Canelo is kind of a or at least to a -", "74:32", "hey buddy", "74:33", "he'll always be Floyd will always be the", "74:36", "bigger storm yes based on what he's", "74:38", "amassed yeah his career and just who use", "74:39", "but when you look at what Canelo does", "74:41", "like when he knocked out Amir Khan he's", "74:43", "that you know he that motherfucker could", "74:45", "put some heat on some punches he can", "74:48", "partnership and he could box - do you", "74:49", "think he can vary that's one thing he", "74:51", "really did learn from fighting flowing", "74:53", "you know how to not be there you know", "74:56", "and you saw that in the subsequent", "74:57", "fights like he learned from that fight", "74:59", "like that was a learning lesson and you", "75:01",

"75:51", "expose him like he took away his", "75:53", "strength and then you know exposed his", "75:55", "weakness like tight like in a 12-round", "75:57", "fashion like not one round not five not", "75:59", "two but 12 rounds and left and left", "76:02", "Canelo without answers like that type of", "76:04", "stuff that's the way I was brought up", "76:06", "yeah like man take away his greatest",
