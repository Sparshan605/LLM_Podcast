said it's", "44:14", "it's like almost like a religious point", "44:16", "of view it's like you're empowering", "44:18", "yourself with this it's way way of", "44:21", "looking at the world but it's like oh I", "44:24", "don't know it's it's it's a tricky thing", "44:28", "to think that you're creating your", "44:30", "entire world and that you're controlling", "44:32", "your own destiny like that it's very", "44:34", "weird weird to not recognize that", "44:37", "there's a lot of interactions and to", "44:39", "ignore all of them like if you see all", "44:41", "the interactions like on a

time we", "45:32", "what we were really lacking was just", "45:34", "confidence", "45:35", "understanding of our capabilities and", "45:37", "that you really can completely manifest", "45:41", "your own reality with your mind and that", "45:44", "your your whole world that you live in", "45:46", "you can orchestrate with your mind", "45:48", "Wow that mean in the future one day that", "45:51", "tone turns out that that's the next", "45:53", "evolving capability of human beings then", "45:57", "where they just weren't aware of it but", "45:58", "some of them made it happen on their own",

own", "46:07", "choice to do so yeah be fascinating but", "46:10", "it's it's for me personally I see why", "46:14", "she commits to it I see why it would be", "46:16", "empowering and I see why it makes her", "46:18", "feel like really strong and powerful and", "46:20", "I see all the benefit in it but my point", "46:25", "of view is always way more who the fuck", "46:28", "knows there's way more who the fuck", "46:31", "knows to anything I can't confirm like", "46:33", "for sure 100% I don't have anything in", "46:36", "front of me that tells me that that", "46:39", "could be real I don't have anything it", "46:41", "might be I mean it's one of the possible", "46:44", "scenarios the imagination could conjure", "46:46", "up you could conjure up a million", "46:48", "different scenarios as to why you're", "46:51", "here why you're built like you are while", "46:53", "you have the interest you have you can", "46:55", "come up with a million different", "46:57", "combinations

be real it might be real it", "47:17", "absolutely might be real she almost was", "47:20", "borderline talking about being similar", "47:22", "simulation theory meaning like like you", "47:24", "chose the player you picked the outfit", "47:26", "you know and then you went and like like", "47:28", "she was almost saying that we played a", "47:29", "game we we we made our character and we", "47:32", "chose the level that we were going to do", "47:34", "where what part of the map we were going", "47:36", "to live on and it was weird if you", "47:38", "thought of it that way like she always", "47:40", "almost doing some kind of hippie version", "47:42", "of the simulation theory yeah very much", "47:44", "so yeah I think the people that believe", "47:47", "in the secret", "47:48", "and the people that believe in", "47:49", "simulation theory me there's a", "47:51", "definitely a cross over there right I", "47:53", "mean if you're really creating your own", "47:56", "reality", "47:57",

"48:17", "the world was a simulation you you know", "48:20", "if there's no if it never was even a", "48:22", "theory and you just looked at this world", "48:25", "and you go oh", "48:26", "does this make it sense now this world", "48:28", "is filled with shit that doesn't make", "48:29", "sense", "48:30", "all the the the I mean besides the", "48:34", "marijuana laws and sketch artists in", "48:37", "courtrooms and there's a million fucking", "48:40", "things that make no sense as a million", "48:42", "things they're stacked up all over the", "48:43", "place and then there's a million things", "48:46", "that are like so beyond our capability", "48:49", "of even the people that are enthusiasts", "48:52", "in them like when it comes to cellphones", "48:54", "or when it comes to that

bandwidth not you know", "49:07", "108 111 B with a okay yeah all right it", "49:11", "comes to this way do you know how to", "49:13", "make that do you do you know what you", "49:15", "would have to do do you know what", "49:16", "reactions that are causing the", "49:18", "interaction between those two devices I", "49:20", "have no fucking clue and these things", "49:23", "exist right alongside

the Roaring Twenties of", "49:37", "the technological era it would look", "49:40", "exactly like this day and time so if we", "49:43", "really are players in a simulation it", "49:45", "makes a lot of sense this the the the", "49:50", "beyond bizarre nature of this reality", "49:53", "makes a lot of sense of its fake the", "49:56", "problem is it sounds retarded you say", "49:59", "that you sound like a fucking idiot", "50:00", "beside", "50:01", "weirdo selling a dumbass he said but", "50:05", "scientists way smarter than us are the", "50:08", "ones who are proposing this it's not us", "50:11", "like I didn't invent the idea of", "50:13", "simulation theory I became fascinated", "50:15", "with it I talk about it all the time but", "50:17", "it absolutely never came from my mind it",
