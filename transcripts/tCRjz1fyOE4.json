it about people where it's so", "06:44", "compelling to find a species that we", "06:47", "were we thought didn't exist or we", "06:49", "thought was extinct like whether it's", "06:51", "Bigfoot or

much more", "07:09", "inviting to the general to the general", "07:12", "populace", "07:13", "to get an answer to then knowing oh you", "07:15", "know there's 700 of them left and we're", "07:17",

and then one I spent a couple", "07:34", "weeks in Tasmania with a amazing", "07:36", "biologist Nick Mooney who he's adamant", "07:39", "that he's seen thylacine and he's a", "07:40", "biologist this isn't you know someone", "07:42", "who worked as a biologist that was out", "07:45", "in the wilderness going yeah yeah I've", "07:46", "seen thylacine and he was terrified to", "07:48", "tell everybody and that that tells me", "07:51", "that it's more credible right if you're", "07:53", "scared to tell people because of your", "07:55", "reputation as opposed to like going out", "07:57", "there going I saw it I saw it I saw it", "07:59", "right that becomes more credible than", "08:00", "the people who are just waving their", "08:02", "arms in the air go and I told you it's", "08:03", "here when did he come out of the", "08:05", "thylacine closet I'm scared to tell", "08:07", "people when I'm not sure if he told us", "08:13", "first or if it was public right before", "08:16", "then but not long ago", "08:18", "I mean maybe 10 years ago yeah that's", "08:20", "such a cool-looking animal too because", "08:22", "it was a marsupial tiger right yeah", "08:24", "sucio predator it's like a marsupial", "08:27", "wolf with tiger stripes it's so bizarre", "08:29", "and it had this amazing jaw that would", "08:32", "open like like a snake's like way wider", "08:34", "than its head should stripes on the back", "08:37", "just such a cool animal yeah and the", "08:40", "last one died in a zoo right the last", "08:42", "one that we think yep in Hobart in", "08:44", "Tasmania but let me let me lay this on", "08:47", "yeah so my next expedition for that", "08:50", "animal cuz I'm like all those other", "08:51", "people that are kind of obsessed with it", "08:53", "my next expedition for that animal is to", "08:55", "Papua New Guinea", "08:56", "so this species yeah that's right this", "08:59", "is this species used to range all the", "09:01", "way from Papua New Guinea down through", "09:03", "mainland Australia and into Tasmania", "09:06", "when people came over and settled that", "09:08", "area they brought with them dogs dingoes", "09:10", "and dingoes out competed them in", "09:12", "mainland Australia and possibly in Papua", "09:15", "New Guinea 4000 years ago but the the", "09:17", "thylacine remained in Tasmania where", "09:19", "there are no dingoes to out-compete them", "09:21", "but in mainland Australia you've got a", "09:23", "diversity of habitats so there are", "09:25", "places the thylacine could still hide", "09:27", "but in Papua New Guinea the terrain is", "09:29", "so crazy that the idea is that in", "09:31", "certain regions dingoes could have never", "09:34", "made it there so perhaps there's these", "09:36", "isolated

compelling", "10:18", "I mean if you really did get an absolute", "10:21", "photograph of a thylacine and you knew", "10:23", "it was real or captured one yeah I think", "10:27", "I think it would be the you know", "10:30", "discovery of the century and I think it", "10:31", "would kind of shift the scales for", "10:34", "people that are on the fence about why", "10:36", "do I care about

we put a bounty on its head and", "10:46", "now it's back like it's hung on by a", "10:48", "thread like that's such a message of", "10:50", "hope you know let's save it let's bring", "10:51", "it back yeah well the whole environment", "10:55", "in Australia is so strange and now", "10:56", "because of the wildfires you know", "10:59", "there's a lot of species like those we", "11:01", "were just talking the other day about", "11:01", "the koala bears yeah that the koala", "11:04", "bears a lot of their habitat got burnt", "11:05", "you know a lot of", "11:06", "fires really sad really

this shark coming like", "17:31", "that and I just pulled my arm back and I", "17:33", "literally just clipped a single tooth", "17:34", "but I think if it had been a fraction of", "17:36", "a second later that would have been the", "17:38", "hand fuck how big was a shark that's", "17:42", "probably like it's um it's probably the", "17:43", "next page over it's probably an 8 foot", "17:45", "shark

year really mm-hmm why well", "18:34", "because we used to we used to hunt them", "18:36", "first of all and we used to hunt seals", "18:37", "and sea lions as well and that's all", "18:39", "been banned for a long time so there's", "18:41", "way more seals and sea lions now and", "18:43", "there's more sharks reproducing and I", "18:45", "think you know I think there's something", "18:46", "to be said for them the water being", "18:49", "consistently warmer and them staying", "18:51", "further north than they used to as well", "18:53", "or south depending on which way they're", "18:55",

their morphology", "22:23", "like their body type doesn't allow them", "22:26", "to share with us how much more", "22:27", "intelligent they are than we really", "22:29", "realize but we know a little bit you", "22:30", "know we know how they can sing across", "22:32", "oceans and communicate and all get", "22:34", "together and yeah it's amazing", "22:36", "synchronizing the way they swim yeah", "22:38", "mazing creatures well and then there's", "22:40", "orcas who eat them yeah she's even more", "22:43", "fucked up because we love orcas do you", "22:45", "see when you see an orca killing a whale", "22:47", "you like oh well that's where they got", "22:48", "their name right mm-hmm killer whale", "22:50", "yeah it's because they kill whales yep", "22:52", "and they are a whale they're in

there has never", "23:19", "been an attack on a human being by an", "23:22", "orca in the wild period there have been", "23:24", "multiple in aquariums you know well", "23:27", "there's been shows going on that kind of", "23:28", "stuff but I believe there's never", "23:29", "actually been a recorded case of a death", "23:32", "by Orca in the wild that's kind of crazy", "23:34", "when you think about it what just shows", "23:36", "their intelligence right it shows they", "23:37", "look at you and go nope that's not on", "23:39", "the menu like that's not that's not", "23:40", "something I need to eat they must be", "23:42", "hungry sometimes well what's interesting", "23:44", "about orcas is there's really two sexes", "23:45", "of their diet there's there's orcas that", "23:48", "only eat marine mammals and there's", "23:50", "orcas that only eat stingrays and some", "23:52", "other fish species and so I think you", "23:55", "know for those people you see some of", "23:57", "those incredible photographers like Paul", "23:58", "Nicola and stuff like that that get", "23:59", "those images of them underwater they're", "24:01", "diving with the fish eating orcas I", "24:03", "think a few people have been successful", "24:05", "in diving with the mammal eating ones", "24:07", "but that's I feel like that's a dice for", "24:09", "all our position mm-hmm they might miss", "24:11", "thank you well you you're a mammal and", "24:13", "you're not your seal sighs you know", "24:15", "Jamie who are we talking to about orcas", "24:17", "and the the population that lives in the", "24:21", "north the Pacific nor", "24:23", "West like around Seattle that only eats", "24:26", "the chinook salmon remember we were", "24:28", "having this conversation the other day", "24:30", "with somebody filled DeMars was it Phil", "24:33", "I mean I was a clip from probably yeah", "24:35", "okay so that's a crazy situation right", "24:37", "you have a population of orcas that only", "24:40", "eats chinook salmon and then there's a", "24:42", "decline in the population of chinook", "24:44", "salmon so they're trying to figure out", "24:45", "how to get them to eat seals right they", "24:47", "try in there like they won't do it right", "24:49", "there the local population but then they", "24:50", "have these migratory populations that", "24:52", "come in and do eat seals seals yeah and", "24:54", "they're like hey you assholes are", "24:56", "starving to death fucking food", "24:57", "everywhere right but they won't do it", "24:59", "they were I switch over it's very", "25:01", "strange isn't it and you got to wonder", "25:02", "how much of that is learned behavior", "25:03", "right how many parent orcas are passing", "25:06", "down this is the food you know this is", "25:08", "how you hunt salmon this is what you eat", "25:10", "right everything else is off the menu", "25:12", "versus what's instinctual like how did", "25:14", "that one group of orcas learn to eat", "25:15", "seals whereas the other one is so", "25:17", "dedicated to salmon it's it's amazing", "25:20", "well it's amazing that they didn't adapt", "25:22", "right they're starving granny don't", "25:25", "branch out right or maybe they're just", "25:26", "unsuccessful mmm you know maybe maybe", "25:28", "they've never learned how to hunt seals", "25:31", "because it's definitely a different", "25:32", "behavior to scooping up a fish right so", "25:34", "yeah it is amazing you'd think they", "25:36", "would get to this kind of tipping point", "25:38", "where they're like there's not enough to", "25:39", "eat we need to make a transition and", "25:41", "then are they unsuccessful in that", "25:43", "transition because they can't figure out", "25:45", "how to do it are they just not doing it", "25:46", "they just don't know about it it's who", "25:49", "knows it's a real bummer man when you", "25:50", "hear that they're almost starving to", "25:52", "death out there and they're trying to", "25:53", "actually bring chinook salmon to them", "25:55", "you know you know it's it's one of those", "25:59", "things it's like that whole kind of", "26:02", "micro environment is a game of Jenga", "26:05", "right you pull one piece out yeah I got", "26:07", "a tower still standing pull another", "26:08", "piece out and tower still standing you", "26:10", "know it just takes that one piece till", "26:12", "it all collapses that is an interesting", "26:13", "way of looking at it right you know they", "26:15", "were talking about Hawaii you know and", "26:18", "all these different invasive species", "26:20", "that live in Hawaii and there was this", "26:23", "discussion about pigs and they were", "26:25", "saying you know like we should really", "26:27", "take the pigs off of Hawaii and a lot of", "26:30", "the people in Hawaii like hang on right", "26:32", "we've been here as long as the pigs", "26:33", "right so like are we invasive right", "26:36", "what's invasive", "26:37", "now right when does it become because", "26:40", "obviously like luaus they're synonymous", "26:42", "with like eating pigs and wild pigs are", "26:46", "a big part of you know the people that", "26:48", "hunt in Hawaii this of their food source", "26:51", "yeah so they're like well would it but", "26:53", "then you have a situation like lanai", "26:55", "where I go every year the access tier", "26:57", "yeah which is terrible environmentally", "27:00", "it's a disaster right like it's it's all", "27:02", "wrong there are 30,000 deer on this one", "27:05", "island that many 30,000 they don't know", "27:07", "really they're dead guessing this the", "27:09", "estimates between twenty and thirty", "27:10", "thousand right and there's three", "27:11", "thousand people yeah ensued you ain't", "27:13", "never seen anything like it because it's", "27:15", "a little ass island around the whole", "27:16", "thing in an hour", "27:17", "uh-huh I mean maybe a little bit more", "27:19", "than that but not much sure it's a tiny", "27:20", "fucking island right and there's so many", "27:22", "deer yeah that's you'll see them on like", "27:25", "you'll you get your binoculars out and", "27:27", "you look at this huge field and you're", "27:28", "like oh my god don't you see a thousand", "27:31", "oh you're kidding no wow it's great it's", "27:35", "so unnatural no predators only humans", "27:38", "plenty of food right right and they're", "27:40", "just populations exploded everywhere", "27:41", "yeah and they're damn delicious people", "27:45", "who live there it's amazing you know", "27:47", "like if you don't have to have much", "27:48", "money to eat really well right you get a", "27:50", "rifle you go out there bang you got a", "27:52", "deer and you could shoot as many as you", "27:54", "want right you choose seven in a day and", "27:56", "stockpile your freezer and have all your", "27:58", "meat for the year and they're that", "28:00", "abundant like if someone stock yeah", "28:02", "the only thing that keeps me from", "28:03", "killing a ton of them is that I use a", "28:05", "bow and arrow it's really hard to do", "28:06", "with the bow and arrow because they're", "28:07", "so fast and they evolved in Asia to get", "28:10", "away from Tigers mhm", "28:11", "they're an Indian animal right right oh", "28:13", "it's super fast it's it's a tough", "28:16", "argument that could because you're right", "28:18", "like Hawaiian people Pig is culturally", "28:20", "significant to them you know just like", "28:22", "probably access to yours to the people", "28:23", "of lanai and has been for however long", "28:25", "the deer have been there but I guess", "28:27", "it's like at what cost", "28:29", "right at what cost if and I don't think", "28:31", "this is the case but if someone said", "28:33", "look if I know these pigs are culturally", "28:35", "significant to you but if we leave them", "28:37", "here the whole islands ecosystem will", "28:39", "collapse there'll be no birds no fish", "28:40", "you know no lizards nothing is it worth", "28:43", "it to have pigs right like that's and", "28:45", "it's delicate the pigs in particular", "28:47", "wreck is eat everything the", "28:49", "nesting birds still devastate everything", "28:51", "everything of a roots fuck up every tree", "28:54", "everything that's coming up all the", "28:56", "sprouts and everything yeah they're", "28:58", "super destructive here there's", "28:59", "destructive here in California yeah it's", "29:01", "not it's not isolated to Hawaii", "29:03", "everywhere that we've brought pigs", "29:04", "they've done a lot of we're actually", "29:05", "gonna I was we're talking about this out", "29:07", "here we're gonna film something about", "29:09", "hunting pigs at Tejon ranch because to", "29:12", "hone rant the place gets devastated", "29:14", "their agriculture gets devastated by", "29:15", "these pigs there's so many of them right", "29:17", "and they're all over Northern California", "29:20", "has problem in San Jose they're in", "29:23", "people's yards they're destroying", "29:24", "shitting because they're the if you", "29:26", "don't kill them they just breed and", "29:28", "breed and breed and breed and breed and", "29:30", "breed and then they just expand right", "29:31", "and they're they're dealing with them", "29:33", "now even in the northern part of the", "29:34", "United States dealing with them in the", "29:36", "Northeast there was a New York Times", "29:37", "article about it so you can find that", "29:39", "from two days ago about the expansion of", "29:42", "wild pigs is that they're starting to", "29:44", "make their way into the northeastern", "29:45", "states and they're just they can't be", "29:48", "stopped they can survive in any weather", "29:50", "yep they breathe three times a year they", "29:53", "can they're viable I think from the time", "29:55", "they're 5 to 6 months

the feral pigs in the", "30:13", "United States they were brought here by", "30:15", "I believe Christopher Columbus starting", "30:17", "with six animals so the entire 200", "30:21", "million or whatever it is across the", "30:22", "u.s.

"guns you want to talk about how crazy", "30:32", "they can reproduce and how much damage", "30:34", "they do like think of the biomass of", "30:36", "those animals stemming off of like six", "30:38", "of them that's insane and they're so", "30:41", "tough you can put them on a boat and", "30:43", "they'll make it across the ocean oh yeah", "30:44", "no there are may and and they are", "30:46", "terrible for the environment like they", "30:48", "do so much damage to native species to", "30:50", "riparian habitats I mean they're I like", "30:53", "you said we were talking about it out", "30:54", "there briefly and it's it's a good thing", "30:57", "people should realize that invasive", "30:58", "species like that should not be in an", "31:01", "ecosystem well", "31:02", "they certainly shouldn't be in an", "31:03", "ecosystem when there's no balance right", "31:04", "if they're warthogs and they're in", "31:06", "Africa there's a system for that exactly", "31:09", "but

you", "68:11", "know maybe she'd copulated with a male", "68:12", "10 years prior and had been under such", "68:15", "tough environmental stress that she", "68:16", "hadn't had the the biological energy to", "68:18", "lay eggs and we're thinking oh let's get", "68:20", "her some food get her some water who", "68:21", "knows maybe she'll give some offspring", "68:23", "so she might already have fertilized", "68:26", "eggs inside of her from 10 years ago", "68:27", "yeah they can confirm can live in them", "68:29", "too like up to 20 years", "68:30", "that's some serious berm yeah serious",

"and hot and you know all those things", "70:53", "and just so exciting that's amazing yeah", "70:56", "that was fun so when you do have a", "70:58", "discovery like this I mean that that's", "71:02", "got to like open up the door for more", "71:04", "funding more research possibilities more", "71:08", "trips hugely what do you want to do next", "71:10", "well it's so there's that's twofold", "71:12", "right one is it doesn't necessarily open", "71:14", "the door for me more which is good it", "71:16", "doesn't need to it opens the door for", "71:18", "the species and what I mean by that is", "71:19", "when it animals declared extinct that's", "71:21", "it it's gone right extinct means", "71:22", "vanished like no longer in existence so", "71:25", "when you find it back that that opens up", "71:27", "the dollars for a return efforts", "71:28", "management blah blah blah and that's", "71:30", "what's going on currently for that", "71:32", "particular species it's great for me in", "71:34", "the sense that it's like oh this guy is", "71:36", "furthering his reputation of being able", "71:37", "to find these things that other people", "71:39", "aren't which really just boils down to", "71:41", "me being willing willing to embrace", "71:43", "shittier conditions and a lot of other", "71:45", "people are but what's next for me I mean", "71:48", "I I take off for Africa I think January", "71:52", "4th January 5th and I'll be there for", "71:54", "five weeks working on some some missing", "71:57", "sharks missing sharks yeah what kind of", "71:59", "sharks there's four species that in the", "72:02", "wild coast which is like from Durban up", "72:04", "to Mozambique on the east of", "72:06", "southeastern Africa that haven't been", "72:08", "seen in 30 years or more and it's not", "72:11", "necessarily that they're extinct so much", "72:13", "as nobody looks for them and you know", "72:15", "it's like that's a very gray area of are", "72:18", "these animals still there or not and so", "72:20", "myself this guy named Dave Ebert he's", "72:22", "the president of the North American", "72:23", "elastomer brands Society like big shark", "72:25", "guy you know", "72:26", "big other bionerd like myself we're", "72:28", "teaming up and we're going down there", "72:30", "too to try and find some of these", "72:31", "animals I was reading something recently", "72:33", "about great whites in South Africa that", "72:35", "there's a massive decline mm-hmm orcas", "72:39", "orcas were killing white sharks in in", "72:42", "muscle bay that area where Hans Bahia", "72:44", "and I don't exactly remember the reason", "72:47", "I think they were eating their livers", "72:48", "out of the white sharks but yeah they", "72:50", "liked their liver right mm-hmm why do", "72:52", "they like to deliver so much minerals", "72:53", "full of minerals yeah because you know", "72:55", "your liver acts as the filter for the", "72:58", "body basically and so it's it's pretty", "73:01", "well known that big predators orcas", "73:03", "leopards lions you know everything they", "73:06", "they like to target the liver yeah and", "73:08", "it gives them lots of minerals that", "73:09", "otherwise they can't get from flesh I", "73:11", "was watching a documentary on wolves and", "73:12", "there was one of the ways that the Alpha", "73:14", "establishes itself that when there's a", "73:16", "kill it's the first to eat the liver Oh", "73:17", "interesting yeah and there's a guy who", "73:20", "was living with these wolves and he was", "73:22", "like tricking them that he was a wolf", "73:23", "and one of the ways he would do it was", "73:25", "he would eat a liver in front of them", "73:27", "and shit yeah and and then the guy went", "73:31", "away cuz he's a wolf expert and he went", "73:34", "away because there was a farmer that was", "73:36", "having issues with wolves and they were", "73:38", "trying to figure out a way to get the", "73:39", "wolves to leave his livestock alone so", "73:42", "what they did was they set up a speaker", "73:43", "system so they put these gigantic", "73:45", "speakers up and they started", "73:47", "broadcasting these aggressive wolf howls", "73:49", "to let this other wolf pack know that a", "73:52", "new wolf pack had moved into the area so", "73:54", "this guy was on this project for several", "73:56", "months and he came back to the original", "73:59", "wolf pack that he was like conning into", "74:02", "things and the new Alpha had taken over", "74:04", "Oh new alpha was threatening him and so", "74:07", "he had a whimper and knee like he was", "74:08", "like really in danger of being torn", "74:10", "apart by a wolf and on camera he's", "74:14", "inches away from this wolf and it's", "74:17", "bearing it's teasing you know I mean", "74:20", "he's with real wolves right right and so", "74:23", "this guy is like curled up in a fetal", "74:24", "position and whimpering and putting his", "74:26", "paw out like this and this fucking wolf", "74:28", "is baring his teeth just inches from him", "74:30", "huge bumps just here 50-pound wolf like", "74:33", "inches from him just ready to tear him", "74:35", "to shreds", "74:36", "I think they kill each other all the", "74:37", "time oh yeah yeah", "74:39", "in u.s. no no it wasn't in the US I", "74:41", "don't remember where it was but it was", "74:43", "really weird like this guy's life was so", "74:45", "strange because he was in for a long", "74:48", "period of time when he was like running", "74:50", "his research was living with Wolves so", "74:53", "he's with them you know he's a part of", "74:55", "the pack was he I gotta ask you this and", "74:58", "don't answer it if it's uncomfortable", "75:00", "that I've in my field working with", "75:02", "specialized experts a lot like him", "75:04", "obviously that's a whole nother level", "75:05", "mm-hmm", "75:06", "they start to take on characteristics of", "75:08", "these animals I've noticed so like I", "75:10", "worked with a guy who was a bear expert", "75:12", "right and he spent his whole life with", "75:14", "bears and this this man was basically a", "75:16", "bear do you know I mean he was grumpy he", "75:18", "was cranky was big he was hairy like", "75:20", "every part of him seemed like a human", "75:22", "bear I'm wondering if this guy was like", "75:24", "that was he had he started to did it", "75:26", "seemed to you like he had started to", "75:27", "like kind of lose touch with social", "75:29", "norms and he was starting to take on", "75:30", "traits of a wolf that's a good question", "75:32", "it's hard to sit yeah this is the guy so", "75:34", "this guy is this the guy documentary", "75:38", "from 2007-8 called the wolf man yeah I", "75:40", "think this is it yeah so so they're like", "75:44", "Jesus the way they threatened each other", "75:47", "yeah you know I mean so so he would have", "75:50", "a kill and he would drag it over and he", "75:54", "would eat the liver in front of them and", "75:56", "so by doing that he would trick them", "75:58", "into thinking he was the shit see he's", "76:01", "got the liver and tell me tell me that", "76:03", "guy doesn't express Wolf's character", "76:05", "it's like look at his body language and", "76:07", "every I know he's doing that", "76:08", "intentionally for the animal but to me", "76:09", "that guy looks like he thinks he's a", "76:11", "wolf look at that I mean that's insane", "76:13", "how did the cameraman able to get this", "76:16", "close and they're safe too", "76:17", "very good question hey look at this guy", "76:20", "he's little guy out of his fucking mind", "76:22", "yeah that's my bro you're made

they're", "76:34", "one of my favorite animals on the planet", "76:35", "I just think they're so fascinating and", "76:37", "now that they've been reintroduced into", "76:39", "the West you know I I know look at that", "76:42", "like it's growling that thing's kissing", "76:44", "them to show that submissive so he's", "76:46", "eating the liver in front of it have you", "76:49", "ever been to the wolf sanctuary out here", "76:50", "in Pawnee", "76:51", "oh no hurts", "76:51", "know if you ever want to go let me know", "76:53", "I would love to there it's in credits", "76:56", "you know that they don't do it for like", "76:57", "the general public but they rescue", "76:59", "Wolf's and wolf dogs and rehabilitate", "77:01", "them and a lot of times they've been in", "77:03", "fights and they've you know come out of", "77:05", "terrible places and they've got a few", "77:06", "animals that they're they're very", "77:08", "closely related to fully blood", "77:10", "full-blood wild wolves and you can go in", "77:12", "and interact with them you're not", "77:13", "petting them it's not a puppy you know I", "77:14", "mean they don't behave like a dog but", "77:16", "you can go in and have one come up and", "77:18", "approach you and sniff you and it's a", "77:20", "pretty fantastic experience really I'd", "77:22", "like to go let's do it let's do it I'm", "77:24", "in I'll set it up", "77:25", "yeah not doing with that assholes doing", "77:31", "what I was saying is that you know since", "77:33", "they've reintroduced them into the the", "77:37", "West there's been a lot of controversy", "77:40", "behind that and there's talks about", "77:41", "doing that in Colorado and people are", "77:43", "really freaking out like ranchers are", "77:45", "freaking out like hey there's a reason", "77:47", "why everybody killed these things off", "77:48", "right", "77:48", "like don't fucking bring them back cuz", "77:50", "you know there was another surplus", "77:52", "killing that they found I think in", "77:53", "Wyoming where they just wiped out a bunt", "77:56", "like they'll just go ham and kill like", "77:59", "you know 1415 elk cows just because they", "78:03", "can it's a eat them there's a term for", "78:05", "that it's hen house syndrome have you", "78:07", "heard of that no so it's basically like", "78:09", "when a fox gets into the henhouse they", "78:11", "like they get in this like killing", "78:13", "frenzy state where it's not like they're", "78:15", "gonna eat 30 different chickens but", "78:17", "they're gonna kill everyone because", "78:18", "they're in this state right I don't know", "78:20", "that's necessarily the case for that but", "78:22", "um it's it is scary to think of an apex", "78:25", "predator like a wolf getting into that", "78:27", "henhouse type syndrome killing 30 elk", "78:29", "just because they can yeah but you know", "78:32", "what's really interesting Joe is um if", "78:34", "you look as I've done a little bit of", "78:37", "reading on this if you look at how many", "78:38", "instances of wolf fatalities there are", "78:41", "in North America for humans for humans", "78:43", "it's like two or three it's some very", "78:46", "very low numbers there's one in Alaska", "78:47", "like a couple of years back there was a", "78:50", "woman I think through that jogger and", "78:52", "there's one other one yeah and that's", "78:56", "kind of it", "78:56", "you know that's documented however I", "78:59", "have a friend who actually shot an elk", "79:02", "in BC in British Columbia and they", "79:05", "didn't know", "79:06", "but the elk expired right next to a Wolf", "79:09", "Den Oh what and the wolf's tried to", "79:12", "claim the elk they like came out and", "79:15", "said over it he and the guide that he", "79:17", "was with had their back to a tree and", "79:19", "they shot and killed three attacking", "79:22", "wolves and he killed two of them with a", "79:24", "bow and arrow and the other guy killed", "79:26", "one with a rifle and they were like", "79:28", "almost out of bullets and he had one", "79:30", "arrow left and they're surrounded by", "79:32", "wolves", "79:32",

"lost three and so they bailed and they", "79:42", "took off out of the area but they were", "79:43", "in the den he said there was bones in", "79:45", "there and they realized like that they", "79:48", "just were hunting and they'd shot an elk", "79:49", "and it just happened to be right right", "79:51", "where the Wolves had a den to have one", "79:54", "of the skulls at home on my desk of the", "79:56", "wolves yeah oh wow yeah bad stories nuts", "79:59", "when John tells the story John Dudley", "80:02", "yeah there's a video that you watch on", "80:05", "YouTube", "80:05", "okay and

"kept their heads off with their their", "90:31", "mandibles at the pump chop-chop and", "90:33", "there's so much bigger so they fly in", "90:35", "and there's a slow-motion video of these", "90:39", "enormous Hornets flying in and", "90:42", "decapitating thousands and thousands of", "90:46", "honeybees so what's interesting is the", "90:49", "honeybees they're so outsized I mean the", "90:53", "Hornets are literally like 50 60 times", "90:54", "larger I you see it there they're great", "90:56", "just so maybe that's not the right", "90:57", "number but they're much much larger and", "90:59", "they're much more powerful but the", "91:02", "honeybees figured out a strategy to kill", "91:04", "the Hornets and what they do is they", "91:07", "surround them they get on top of them", "91:10", "and then they beat their wings they'll", "91:12", "all generate heat and then they kill the", "91:16", "the Hornets with the heat of their body", "91:18", "that's unbelievable unbelievable yeah so", "91:21", "here's this thing that's decapitating", "91:23", "everyone in your little village right", "91:25", "and so you have to jump on top of it and", "91:27", "flex and heat it up yeah but the fact", "91:30", "that they were able to devise this", "91:32", "strategy see look how they do it man", "91:34", "they just grab ahold of these bees and", "91:36", "just decapitate them it's unbelievable", "91:38", "they have these horrific faces right", "91:40", "these giant mandibles yeah I can see", "91:42", "that and they're just swarm in and they", "91:44", "just look at them they're just chopping", "91:45", "these fucking honeybees apart you you", "91:48", "said it nature you cruel beautiful bitch", "91:52", "three Hornets versus 30,000 bees do you", "91:56", "know why the Hornets are doing this are", "91:57", "they getting honey we want the larva a", "91:59", "larva yeah yeah they probably want the", "92:01", "larva or they want the honey they want", "92:03", "something but look at all these dead", "92:05", "fucking bees with no heads bizarre crazy", "92:08", "it's not I mean it's it's just so weird", "92:11", "right that that you know that nature", "92:14", "devises these sort of strategies to", "92:17", "prevent overpopulation and that there's", "92:20", "this balance that takes place where you", "92:22", "know the bees are threatened by", "92:24", "something that's very be like so you see", "92:26", "how that", "92:26", "getting on top of them yeah so that's", "92:28", "that's their strategy for for dealing", "92:31", "they all get on top of them so you see a", "92:33", "bunch of them now and he's trying to get", "92:35", "away but he can't fly away and so then", "92:37", "they swarm and then they eventually kill", "92:40", "him so you think that actually like", "92:41", "cooks the wasp something it overheats", "92:44", "their body and it fort see it how many", "92:46", "of them are on there yeah there's", "92:47", "something that it does where it", "92:48", "overheats their body Wow the size the", "92:52", "size comparison there's so much bigger", "92:54", "imagine if you had that Hornet you know", "92:57", "that was six feet long oh my god I think", "93:00", "giant insects would be the worst the", "93:02", "worst yeah the worst I think would be", "93:04", "praying mantises the shit out of me", "93:07", "mm-hmm we've

"flying through the air so I make it up", "108:40", "to it's just but it's so weird like what", "108:42", "a weird system it's like nature's", "108:44", "assuring robustness they're sure", "108:46",

a", "109:06", "fucking 1800 pound they're looking to", "109:08", "eat you it's crazy it's so cool but that", "109:13", "that is a viable system is this is the", "109:15", "system that's been in place forever", "109:17", "right so strange right and and that you", "109:20", "know we can destroy that so quickly we", "109:24", "put one dam in and that that ruins that", "109:26", "whole ecosystem for that River and the", "109:27", "Bears and the salmon and the spawning", "109:29", "and you know we can remedy that we put", "109:30", "salmon ladders in and yadda yadda but", "109:32", "it's it's interesting that everything", "109:35", "seems so tough as you just said and at", "109:37", "the same time it's so fragile because we", "109:39", "you know we do one thing like putting a", "109:41", "hydroelectric dam and it ruins the", "109:43", "entire ecosystem yeah we were in Seattle", "109:45", "and in Seattle there's a place where you", "109:47", "can go and it's like underneath this", "109:49", "bridge and there's these clear", "109:51", "plexiglass walls and you can actually", "109:54", "see the salmon the way through and up", "109:57", "the river and they were explaining how", "109:58", "they had put dams in and didn't really", "110:01", "understand the consequences of putting", "110:02", "these dams back when they did and then", "110:04", "all these salmon would go to the mouth", "110:07", "of the river where they thought they", "110:08", "were going to go upriver and it would be", "110:09", "locked right there and he has died and", "110:12", "didn't breed and so the population", "110:14", "drastically diminished these salmon died", "110:16", "in like in the harbor yep like really", "110:19", "wild stuff yeah it's crazy and then", "110:22", "supports you know like that food source", "110:23", "that protein supports not just like the", "110:26", "Bears and the birds but like the whole", "110:28", "river is ecology right like the river", "110:29", "the lg's that live in the river the", "110:32", "little bugs that live in the algae", "110:33", "depend on those salmon dying up that", "110:35", "river and fertilizing the river yeah so", "110:38", "it's like the

relation to", "113:42", "whatever the fuck is going on in its", "113:43", "head right right so wild nuts it's just", "113:47", "so weird how they can instantaneously", "113:49", "change their coloration and their", "113:51", "texture and then perfectly blend in with", "113:54", "coral right like when you see them like", "113:56", "stopped on a coral reef and just become", "113:58", "the reef you like what ardently - it's", "114:00", "like yeah and it's gone the colors in", "114:02", "this thing you know what simcha there", "114:04", "are actual there are people that", "114:06", "actually believe they are from out of", "114:07", "space I've seen that I'm gonna bring it", "114:09", "up to you that there's biologists that", "114:11", "believe that they came in and asteroids", "114:13", "and eggs you got it yeah that's exactly", "114:15", "really think about that I think like", "114:18", "look I believe in life outside of Earth", "114:19", "but I don't I don't necessarily think", "114:21", "that octopus came from that I think", "114:23", "they're you know they have other stuff", "114:25", "like there are other cephalopods that", "114:27", "they're related to genetically squid and", "114:29", "cuttlefish and things like that", "114:31", "I don't necessarily think they came from", "114:32", "out of space but I can see why", "114:34", "there's science to support that it's a", "114:36", "possibility and then I can also see why", "114:38", "people think that seeing them well", "114:40", "there's thoughts about that with a lot", "114:41", "of different life forms like spores", "114:43", "there's thoughts about that when it", "114:45", "comes to psilocybin mushrooms yep", "114:47", "there's like the real freaky psychedelic", "114:49", "heads think that psilocybin mushrooms", "114:51", "came from asteroids right and and the", "114:54", "the proof and the pudding in that one so", "114:56", "to speak is the fact that you can take", "114:58", "mushroom spores into the vacuum of space", "115:00", "and bring them back to earth and there", "115:02", "they still they still fruit yeah trying", "115:06", "to grow a weed right now to see what", "115:07", "happens out there you guys sent a little", "115:08", "bit of weed into something on the space", "115:10", "station I think we're gonna test it for", "115:11", "30 days and see if it's viable really", "115:13", "that's when we get the weed business us", "115:17", "and Elon space weed SpaceX right is", "115:20", "Wheatley LAN cent weed in the space I", "115:22", "don't think this is the first time it's", "115:23", "been done but the story went around cuz", "115:25", "that's interesting because when he was", "115:27", "on here I don't know if the game hailed", "115:30", "no he's growing weed in space look at", "115:33", "what they're the octopus eggs look like", "115:35", "whoa and so they're developing those", "115:39", "intelligent chromatophores that thing", "115:41", "that basically the skin picks up the", "115:42", "color and changes to match", "115:44", "mm-hmm right there in the embryo yeah", "115:47", "look at their little eyeballs how weird", "115:51", "and look how many of them like an", "115:53", "invasion the imagine if your wife gave", "115:56", "birth to that many people no thanks", "115:58", "you'd be like oh I have a school school", "116:01", "full of kids hey first of all I'm", "116:04", "getting fucking snipped look at that", "116:05", "look how they drop off points what the", "116:07", "matrix looks like exactly dude the", "116:12", "matrix is not that far off and it seems", "116:14", "like the further this further we go in", "116:17", "time and human evolutionary time the", "116:19", "more it seems like it's an act it's", "116:20", "accurate you know I think we're getting", "116:22", "more and more plugged in every yeah it's", "116:24", "like a combination of the matrix and the", "116:26", "Terminator together yeah I'm very", "116:30", "concerned about the future of our", "116:32", "species but but going back to octopus", "116:35", "octopus and cuttlefish are closely", "116:37", "related right and they both can change", "116:39", "the texture in their color yeah", "116:41", "cuttlefish have lack less textural", "116:45", "changes they're more color based okay", "116:47", "what was the one they did", "116:48", "would they had him over a chessboard and", "116:51", "it was trying to meet you ever seen that", "116:52", "we're now this is trying to mimic a", "116:54", "chessboard that's cool yeah is really", "116:55", "weird because it throws a system off", "116:57", "because there's any right angles and", "116:59", "it's hard just yeah and the one zero", "117:02", "contrast so when you look at it like", "117:05", "this octopus like trying to like figure", "117:07", "out her right what to do yeah can you", "117:09", "see actual like lines in his color I", "117:11", "don't remember I remember it being weird", "117:13", "is it a coefficient yeah see if we could", "117:16", "see it here it's very strange pictures", "117:19", "good yeah look at that I mean that's", "117:23", "pretty good", "117:24", "like pretty fucking good yeah look it's", "117:27", "got white squares man write the goddamn", "117:29", "things growing white squares started", "117:30", "with zebra stripes and then I think it", "117:32", "maybe it figured out the squares after a", "117:33", "couple that's pretty impressive I like", "117:36", "the picture in the bottom right there", "117:37", "where the guy looks like he's playing", "117:38", "chess against the cuttlefish", "117:39", "I never mind I thought there's a", "117:41", "cuttlefish yeah just what a strange", "117:46", "ability that these animals have", "117:49", "unbelievable figured out I mean just how", "117:54", "the fuck did that evolve right there", "117:56", "they're devising strategies in order to", "117:59", "be more effective predators while", "118:00", "they're in the ocean and hide from other", "118:02", "predators right and they've figured out", "118:04", "a way to change the color in the texture", "118:06", "of their skin like how long did that", "118:08", "take exactly exactly", "118:11", "millions of years yeah this like it's an", "118:14", "endless source of fascination like", "118:16", "wildlife documentaries to me are just", "118:17", "truly an endless source of fascination", "118:19", "there I mean you know you're preaching", "118:21", "to the choir but yeah I think they're", "118:23", "phenomenal you there's just so much we", "118:25", "can learn and it's like it's more than", "118:27", "just what we learned oh that's cool", "118:29", "that's a nice fact about an octopus but", "118:30", "you know we took how we shape Jets off", "118:33", "of the shape of birds we've taken so", "118:36", "much inspiration from nature into our", "118:38", "everyday lives look at this look at this", "118:41",

"118:54", "this is so weird", "118:56", "oh god they're so strange such a stream", "119:01", "strange animal but the ocean is so", "119:04", "bizarre in and of itself there's just so", "119:06", "many weird creatures on ocean it's such", "119:09", "an alien environment to us as", "119:10", "terrestrial mammals do you remember when", "119:12", "the tsunami hit Thailand and then there", "119:16",

"119:39", "got like 30 or 40 new species or", "119:41", "something crazy like that literally like", "119:43", "combing through the streets of the", "119:45", "cities where these where the tsunami had", "119:47", "hit yeah is that a richer source of", "119:51", "bioresources of the the ocean of a", "119:54", "biodiversity I should say the ocean then", "119:57", "earth oh there's more life in the ocean", "119:59", "than on terrestrial land for sure yeah", "120:01", "you mean is there more diversity in", "120:04", "general weirdness oh yeah there's way", "120:06", "more I I guess it depends how you define", "120:07", "weirdness but like look at an octopus", "120:09", "look at a cuttlefish you know look at", "120:11", "those deep sea creatures crabs and all", "120:14", "the way into the marine mammals and all", "120:16", "the way down to the tiny little insects", "120:17", "are isopods that live in the ocean I", "120:19", "think I think the ocean creatures are", "120:21", "very bizarre how about those giant squid", "120:23", "that they found on that oil tanker giant", "120:28", "squid with the crazy like crab legs yep", "120:31", "that one legs maybe not never see that", "120:34", "one with the crab legs is he walking", "120:35", "along the bottom no it's got like it", "120:38", "looks like it has appendages well with", "120:41", "the joints yeah haven't seen oh my god", "120:43", "oh I'm gonna show you something I'm", "120:44", "learning a lot today I like this crazy", "120:48", "alien looking squid I found another", "120:52", "thing about those pictures they've been", "120:54", "gone around multiple times after", "120:56", "tsunamis apparently they don't have", "120:57", "anything to do with the tsunami they're", "120:58", "just there are real photographs of real", "121:00", "strange sea creatures they just didn't", "121:02", "washed up on shore after tsunami what", "121:04", "about the thing that you'd saw that's", "121:06", "what I said when I was her 2004 in 2011", "121:09", "the same photos also people are", "121:11", "bullshitting Russians believe me", "121:16", "go to pull up that alien squid", "121:19", "discovered near oil rig so they had a", "121:24", "camera deep under this oil rig and they", "121:27", "spotted this thing with these insane", "121:29", "long appendages look at this oh whoa", "121:32", "yeah that's different", "121:34", "I thought you look at the fucking length", "121:37", "of those what are those things that", "121:39", "dangle from it what do you would you", "121:40", "call those things let tentacles legs", "121:43", "what is it but look at the legs on it", "121:45", "like an insect that's very bizarre see", "121:48", "how they have like very like obvious", "121:51", "bends video courtesy of shale oil", "121:53", "company doing a good job for nature yeah", "121:56", "right I see the deep there's another one", "121:58", "is that another but look how weird it is", "122:02", "how it has like a clear bends like when", "122:05", "you see that thing underwater floating", "122:07", "around like that like that looks like an", "122:09", "alien", "122:10", "totally totally that is that is our", "122:11", "exact kind of depiction of what an alien", "122:13", "species go to that green one right next", "122:15", "to it oh yeah look at that like look at", "122:17", "that that's crazy I mean if you saw that", "122:18", "underwater you would shit your pay $150", "122:37", "but that the length of the actual", "122:39", "tentacles whatever the fuck it is was", "122:42", "really long so strange", "122:46", "and this before they got this video", "122:49", "footage of it they didn't even know", "122:50", "something like this was real and there's", "122:52", "there's like a lot of those where you", "122:53", "get these deep-sea cameras and you're", "122:55", "like oh there's a species we haven't", "122:56", "ever documented before so it's in the", "122:59", "Gulf of Mexico they caught a depth of", "123:01", "seven thousand eight hundred feet but", "123:03", "they did what does it say how big they", "123:04", "think it is you can just type in 9 mag", "123:07", "fins magnet weena the squid size just", "123:11", "big big fin like a fucking just so weird", "123:15", "it look like the way that the head of it", "123:17", "sort of pulsates and moves with waves", "123:19", "like it's like a Steven Spielberg", "123:21", "creation yeah yeah that and then there's", "123:23", "also a puppy right you know that's how", "123:26", "diverse life is okay", "123:28", "length is up to 15 to 20 times the", "123:30", "mantle 20 26 feet okay that's one more", "123:33", "or more yeah well giant octopus is -", "123:36", "right giant squids were thought to be", "123:38", "bullshit until like fairly recently rekt", "123:41", "yeah I don't know when specifically but", "123:43", "they've found a few that have washed up", "123:44", "and then they got some they got some", "123:46", "actual footage of some that's what I", "123:48", "thought you were talking about on some", "123:49", "rigs easy", "123:52", "what about octopi what's the largest of", "123:55", "the octopi the Giant Pacific octopus so", "123:57", "the species that you saw attacking that", "123:59", "eagle", "123:59", "that's not a huge one but as far as as", "124:02", "far as I know that's the largest one the", "124:03", "fucker yeah that's a giant squid it's a", "124:07", "big cephalopod oh that thing's huge that", "124:11", "looks like it's more than 28 feet if you", "124:14", "stretch that bitch I know those ones", "124:15", "those ones are those ones are like a", "124:17", "hundred plus feet yeah that's what the", "124:19", "giant squid yeah a hundred plus feet", "124:22", "they can get up to that yeah it is so", "124:23", "nuts", "124:24", "isn't it a hundred foot jelly creature", "124:27", "you know and you know what's interesting", "124:29", "is sperm whales will leave the surface", "124:32", "of the ocean and dive down to their", "124:34", "depths to hunt those Calamari's good", "124:40", "look at that fucker so weird", "124:43", "so the the large pacific octopus how big", "124:47", "Giants Giant Pacific octopus how BIG's", "124:49", "that guy get um I don't know and I mean", "124:52", "you know cuz they fan out so I'm not", "124:55", "sure", "124:56", "maybe 5 feet long 6 feet long but heavy", "124:59", "like 40 50 60 pounds something like that", "125:01", "they've got a really big one at the", "125:02", "Monterey Bay Aquarium really yeah really", "125:05", "cool one oh I've been to that I've been", "125:07", "to that aquarium back in the day yeah", "125:09", "The Legend of the Kraken like they used", "125:13", "to think that that was all total", "125:14", "horseshit right until they found some", "125:16", "fossilized cups they found some suction", "125:20", "cups mhm that were the you know some", "125:22", "fossilized evidence of enormous cups", "125:25", "right that they think are indicative of", "125:27", "this you know real hundred foot octopus", "125:30", "or fucking octopus well or just a", "125:32", "hundred foot squid on the surface you", "125:34", "know what I like you said those stories", "125:36", "always get embellished so even if it was", "125:38", "a 60 foot squid on the surface say it", "125:40", "was injured or dying and it was", "125:42", "live and the boat hit it and it starts", "125:43", "slapping the boat with its with its", "125:45", "tentacles haha my tits to crack and like", "125:49", "that's not going to turn into a crazy C", "125:51", "fable to imagine though if you were one", "125:52", "of those dudes that was like making your", "125:54", "way across the ocean and you you know in", "125:57", "the 1100s or some sh a and you jump in", "125:59", "the water to wash off and you get eaten", "126:01", "by a giant octopus in front of your", "126:02", "friends yeah that's it's literally", "126:12", "suction cups that rip you apart oh it's", "126:14", "crazy and it's totally possible that", "126:16", "those things were huge we just don't", "126:17", "have the fossil evidence because they're", "126:19", "all made of jelly right you know they're", "126:20", "just like they don't fossilize yeah yeah", "126:22", "all you get is like if you those", "126:25", "fossilized the images of the the the", "126:29", "cups is just because it left an imprint", "126:33", "writing some sort of soils right at the", "126:35", "bottom so you you like these kind of far", "126:37", "out there ideas how do you like this", "126:39", "idea there is a cut there's a group of", "126:41", "people that say that dragons were real", "126:44", "and I'll explain so it around the same", "126:48", "time period so to speak and I'm not one", "126:49", "of these people so I'm probably gonna", "126:50", "get the details wrong Matthew", "126:52", "McConaughey movie yeah seriously but so", "126:55", "around the same time period in you know", "126:57", "China South America Africa all these", "126:59", "different Rome all these places images", "127:02", "depicted people fighting dragons right", "127:04", "and every every dragon was slightly", "127:05", "different but it was all a giant scaly", "127:07", "animal that could fly so when you take", "127:11", "when you break that down you think about", "127:13", "the fact that large birds had a hard", "127:15", "time being fossilized because their", "127:16", "bones are so porous right so because", "127:18", "bones there have like hollow wishbones", "127:20", "they break down very easily they don't", "127:22", "fossilize so the the group that says", "127:25", "this basically they're they're saying", "127:27", "the evidence is the reason there's no", "127:28", "fossils of dragons is because they had", "127:30", "bird bones and they were actually very", "127:32", "delicate animals but a handful of these", "127:35", "more small a small population of these", "127:38", "giant lip flying lizards existed and", "127:40", "basically encompassed all these", "127:43", "different countries where they all", "127:44", "depicted fighting dragons in their own", "127:46", "way and they were all killed off by you", "127:48", "know Knights or whatever it is and then", "127:50", "didn't fossilize so it's like the", "127:54", "science is saying that if there", "127:55", "or lizards big enough to fly around and", "127:57", "eat people they didn't have bones that", "127:59", "could fossilize so it would be like an", "128:01", "eagle right and so and that's why you", "128:03", "know that's why all these human", "128:06", "populations around the world have", "128:07", "depictions of them because they did", "128:09", "actually exist now are there any stories", "128:12", "of dragons like written like in the", "128:14", "times of people that actually had the", "128:16", "written word or is it just depictions I", "128:18", "don't know not my field that I", "128:20", "interesting because like are these", "128:21", "depictions like ancient accounts told by", "128:26", "generation after generally past so I", "128:28", "think I don't know I don't know anything", "128:29", "about dragons or whether it's real but I", "128:31", "think it's interesting to think oh well", "128:34", "the science supports that if there were", "128:35", "flying lizards their bones wouldn't have", "128:37", "fossilized and these have been passed", "128:39", "down stories that have been exaggerated", "128:40", "and passed down from generation to", "128:42", "generation and some of them breathe fire", "128:44", "but some of them don't Yap upon which", "128:47", "culture it was significant - I wonder if", "128:50", "what the fire with the fire supposed to", "128:52", "represent or they just people are full", "128:53", "of shit probably that one yeah probably", "128:55", "made it sound even cooler yeah exactly", "129:00", "do you think that do you hold any weight", "129:03", "do you think that holds any way no", "129:05", "actually dragon I mean we know there", "129:07", "were large flying lizards during the", "129:08", "times the dinosaurs right the only", "129:10", "weight that it could possibly hold is", "129:11", "that like a few of those somehow", "129:13", "survived much later than we previously", "129:15", "thought but I do I think that there were", "129:17", "at dragons attacking human beings and", "129:19", "civilizations now I don't but it's still", "129:21", "interesting it's so much cooler if there", "129:23", "were right and the fact that we know", "129:25", "that pterodactyls did exist that's cool", "129:28", "right would be rate way cores that they", "129:30", "existed with people right 2,000 years", "129:31", "ago why is that so much cooler it's like", "129:35", "I would be I would I mean people would", "129:37", "dedicate giant chunks of their life", "129:39", "trying to find out if pterodactyls did", "129:42", "coexist with human beings at a point in", "129:44", "time oh really what absolutely many of", "129:47", "you but there was a hundred-foot", "129:50", "pterodactyl snatching kids be terrified", "129:52", "Oh God would you know about the the MOA", "129:55", "eagle yeah yeah the hasta hasta act like", "129:59", "all MOA you go because they used to tag", "130:00", "Mouse these
