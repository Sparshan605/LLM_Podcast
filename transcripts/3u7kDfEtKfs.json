and it", "04:40", "was all over the world they were", "04:42", "occupying here and occupying there and", "04:44", "they were setting up camps right they", "04:45", "were essentially living there yeah

interesting", "05:42", "people they have too much money yeah the", "05:44", "interesting thing about socialism is", "05:46", "that no matter how many times it fails", "05:47", "people expect it to succeed right that's", "05:50", "the definition of insanity right doing", "05:52", "something over and over again and", "05:54", "expecting a different result", "05:55", "well the Socialists always expect a", "05:58", "different result from doing something", "05:59", "that has never succeeded in the past so", "06:01", "socialism by definition is one thing but", "06:04", "by the emotional

their lives better or providing a", "07:03", "service that makes their lives better", "07:05", "because the customers are in charge", "07:07", "individuals right that that's what's", "07:09", "gonna

people are frustrated with", "10:01", "the current system and so they see", "10:02", "someone like Bernie Sanders come along", "10:04", "that offers this radical change of pace", "10:06", "he's saying you know we need to end", "10:08", "income inequality and redistribute", "10:11", "wealth and all these different things", "10:12", "and it just sparks an emotional reaction", "10:16", "in people that

solution but look that's why Trump", "10:39", "is president I mean a lot of people", "10:40", "think that Trump's election maybe shows", "10:44", "that the u.s. electorate has moved right", "10:46", "right that we're more Republican or more", "10:49", "free-market but that's not what that", "10:51", "election was about it was about the fact", "10:54", "that we had a lousy economy and Trump",

"11:20", "number is much much higher and Trump", "11:23", "talked about that and he called out you", "11:25", "know all the politicians from both sides", "11:27", "right not just the Democrats the", "11:29", "Republicans and he said look I'm in a", "11:31", "clean house I'm out of politician vote", "11:33", "for me right I'm gonna make America", "11:35", "great again I'm gonna drain the swamp",

we", "11:45", "have too many immigrants taking away the", "11:47", "jobs and so people decided you know what", "11:49", "what the hell let me let me give this", "11:51", "guy a trance because things are bad the", "11:53", "media is lying to me Wall Street's lying", "11:55", "to me and so you know Trump Trump won", "11:57", "but unfortunately now Trump is part of", "12:01", "the establishment and now all of a", "12:03", "sudden the fake economic numbers are", "12:05", "legit now every time there was an", "12:07", "unemployment number out he tweets about", "12:09", "how it's the lowest it's ever been so I", "12:11", "think that when we get this next", "12:14", "recession which is going to happen while", "12:16", "Trump is president during during this", "12:18", "first term which I think will be the", "12:20", "only term but when all really why do you", "12:23", "think those two things well because I", "12:24", "think the economy is going to fall into", "12:26", "a severe recession what makes you say", "12:28", "that", "12:29", "well a you know it's we're overdue right", "12:32", "I mean you don't normally have an", "12:33", "expansion that lasts as long as this one", "12:35", "I think we're we're the second longest", "12:37", "in history and if we go for another year", "12:39", "it'll be the longest expansion in", "12:41", "history", "12:41", "2008 is when it started to turn around", "12:43", "2009 to the end of 2009 years in yeah", "12:48", "exactly what is a usual expansion and", "12:51", "compression I don't know five six years", "12:52", "so so this one is long but also this one", "12:55", "required more government stimulus than", "12:58", "any other you know recovery and I don't", "13:01", "think we actually recovered I think the", "13:03", "government simply you know injected a", "13:05", "bunch of cheap money into the economy", "13:07", "and exacerbated the real problems but", "13:10", "you know reef lated the bubbles in the", "13:12", "stock market and the housing market but", "13:14", "you know everybody talks about how the", "13:15", "economy is doing so great but it's", "13:17", "really not", "13:17", "much better than it was under Obama if", "13:20", "it's any better at all we've GDP growth", "13:22", "for Trump's first year in office last", "13:24", "year was 2.3 percent I mean nothing", "13:26", "great first quarter was 2 percent this", "13:29", "quarter might be a better than 3 maybe", "13:31", "maybe not but I mean I think it's gonna", "13:33", "be the second quarter will probably be", "13:34", "the best quarter of the year maybe we're", "13:36", "probably going to go downhill but you", "13:38", "know last year was I think the the", "13:40", "weakest year of job growth since 2011 so", "13:42", "people want to talk about how great", "13:44", "everything is but it's more a function", "13:46", "of people are hoping things are gonna", "13:48", "turn around there's a lot of optimism", "13:50", "now but things are gonna get better but", "13:52", "I think that the people who are so", "13:53", "optimistic a lot of them are gonna be", "13:54", "disappointed because we're gonna end up", "13:57", "with is a weaker economy the only thing", "13:59", "that's really strengthening is inflation", "14:00", "inflation is gonna pick up so the cost", "14:03", "of living is really gonna be rising as", "14:05", "the economy is falling into recession so", "14:07", "we get stagflation which is probably the", "14:10", "worst possible economic scenario and you", "14:14", "know I think that the the left and even", "14:18", "the Fed is gonna be able to blame it on", "14:20", "Trump because Trump has come in and you", "14:22", "know claimed credit for this great", "14:24", "economy that he believes we have and", "14:26", "he's claimed credit for the record in", "14:28", "the stock market but he's basically put", "14:30", "his name on a bubble and when it pops", "14:31", "you know it's gonna be hard for him to", "14:33", "try to blame the next recession on Obama", "14:36", "when he's already said hey this is my", "14:38", "economy I created it and so people are", "14:41", "gonna be disappointed and they're gonna", "14:43", "vote I think for another person whose", "14:47", "promises change and unfortunately that's", "14:49", "gonna come from the left so you think", "14:51", "this is gonna happen in the next three", "14:53", "years well yeah I mean you know what is", "14:55", "the bubble what do you think is gonna", "14:57", "cause it to crash commercial real estate", "14:59", "is it credit what is it well I mean", "15:01", "commercial real estate is expensive", "15:03", "meaning it's in a bubble but that you", "15:04", "know that's not gonna cause it I mean", "15:06", "airs gonna come out of the bubble I", "15:07", "think we would already be in a pretty", "15:10", "severe recession now had it not been for", "15:12", "Trump winning had Hillary won I think we", "15:15", "would already be there but I think what", "15:17", "makes you say that well we got a lot of", "15:19", "false optimism as a result of of Trump", "15:22", "and we did get the tax cuts and the tax", "15:24", "cuts you know just like you know any", "15:26", "kind of artificial drug you know you can", "15:28", "inject yourself and", "15:30", "a little bit of a phony hi because", "15:32", "remember the tax cuts were paid for with", "15:36", "debt we didn't shrink government right", "15:38", "if you if you make government smaller", "15:40", "that's great then you can cut taxes", "15:42", "because now government doesn't need as", "15:43", "much money and you can you know you can", "15:45", "relieve the taxpayer of the burden of", "15:47", "paying for it and that's great but if", "15:50", "you just cut taxes but you don't cut", "15:52", "government spending and of course what", "15:53", "the Trump administration did was was", "15:55", "even worse they increase government", "15:57", "spending we

"103:41", "size think it's like 30 miles maybe and", "103:43", "that's the length it's it's skinnier", "103:45", "than that so it's it's a small place but", "103:48", "you know relative to the Caribbean I", "103:50", "mean if you compare it to other", "103:51", "Caribbean islands it's pretty big how", "103:53", "long is the flight from like New York to", "103:55", "Puerto Rico actually in the air it's", "103:56", "about three hours but I think the", "103:58", "airlines you know they leave about four", "103:59", "you know if you look at the flight time", "104:01", "but actually from

go to the west coast no", "104:11", "you got it you know you got an aeroplane", "104:13", "would there be a way that all these", "104:16", "people coming in they could somehow or", "104:18", "another fix", "104:19", "this the whole electrical system that", "104:22", "they have there their power grid and", "104:24", "yeah look the power grid this just shows", "104:26", "you all the people that think socialism", "104:28", "is so great look at Puerto Rico that's", "104:31", "why they're broke right the socialists", "104:34", "destroyed Puerto Rico the Socialists in", "104:37", "Puerto Rico and of course the ones that", "104:39", "we have in Washington because all their", "104:40", "problems aren't self-inflicted but we", "104:43", "created a problem for Puerto Rico and", "104:45", "number a number of ways right first of", "104:48", "all right we have the minimum wage that", "104:50", "you know the average income in Puerto", "104:52", "Rico is half of the poorest state in the", "104:55", "United States which I forget I forget", "104:56", "which is the poorest state so I can't uh", "104:58", "Kentucky may be but it's it's half of", "105:01", "half of that right but now you've got a", "105:02", "minimum wage that's the same as Kentucky", "105:05", "so it is basically keeping a lot more", "105:08", "people unemployed but then you have you", "105:10", "still have welfare you still have food", "105:12", "stamps so you have all these people now", "105:13", "that are not working because they're", "105:15", "getting paid by the government but then", "105:17", "you have the Puerto Rican government", "105:18", "which is a major employer of people work", "105:21", "for the government and a lot of them are", "105:23", "just doing nonsense right I mean there's", "105:25",

"105:33", "was a power company you know you mean", "105:35", "it's a disaster but the government is", "105:37", "running everything there and so", "105:38", "everything is inefficient and meanwhile", "105:40", "a lot of the productive people people", "105:43", "who want jobs have left the island like", "105:45", "if you think a high minimum wage is", "105:46", "great all the people who are leaving", "105:48", "Puerto Rico to go to Florida are", "105:50", "effectively even though it's the same", "105:52", "minimum wage they're actually going to a", "105:54", "state that has a much lower

situation where you know", "106:06", "very few people are actually employed so", "106:08", "you don't have a real tax base and then", "106:10", "what America did what really screwed", "106:12", "them over was we made all their bonds", "106:15", "triple tax free we said if you're if you", "106:18", "live in New York and you buy Puerto", "106:22", "Rican government bonds you're not gonna", "106:24",

"106:57", "paper to increase the yield on their", "106:59", "fund so you have everybody wants to", "107:01", "Puerto Rican government bonds so the", "107:02", "Puerto Rican government is creating",

all", "107:11", "sorts of holidays right lots of time off", "107:13", "and they can keep borrowing money so", "107:15", "they got deeper and deeper into debt", "107:17", "because we created a

never gonna pay back their money", "107:28", "and then the other thing that we did to", "107:31", "them and you I talked about I think on", "107:32", "the show is the Jones Act which if you", "107:35", "remember Trump suspended it for like a", "107:37", "week or two after Maria but the Jones", "107:40", "Act should be completely repealed and", "107:43", "especially if Donald Trump's gonna be", "107:45", "talking about well there's a number of", "107:47", "aspects of it but the most significant", "107:50", "to Puerto Rico is that the Jones Act", "107:53", "says that if you want to
