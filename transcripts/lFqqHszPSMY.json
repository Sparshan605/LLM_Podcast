like oh like", "42:17", "that's possible I can do that and so", "42:19", "you're like with Anderson Silva did did", "42:21", "that a lot with his movement with this", "42:24", "head movement with his variety of", "42:25", "punches and kicks and the angles at", "42:28", "which they came in from mm-hmm you know", "42:30", "and I don't know I feel like Anderson", "42:32", "Silva did I feel like

like a jab", "47:28", "yeah but a jab that could fuck you up", "47:30", "like a jab that can knock you out yeah I", "47:33", "think I mean I guess like oh that to my", "47:36", "point", "47:36", "flying days like everybody was bigger", "47:38", "than me it didn't matter because it was", "47:40", "bye-bye belts right so I was always a", "47:42", "smaller one and trying to trying to get", "47:45", "the point off first I would just use my", "47:46", "my front leg and kick it out there as", "47:48", "fast as I could but I do I feel like my", "47:51", "my kicks have blended to being I've", "47:56", "adopted them as jabs you know yeah yeah", "47:59", "I love it I think it helps because then", "48:02", "it kind of neutralizes the height", "48:03", "difference do you train a lot with", "48:05", "Winkeljohn I do Winkeljohn is he was an", "48:08", "excellent fighter a really good", "48:10", "kickboxer and really good at both styles", "48:13", "to it like leg kick style but also good", "48:16", "at like he had karate techniques as well", "48:17", "he and he's also he was very good at", "48:20", "those transitions between those straight", "48:22", "kicks and punches well you know that's", "48:25", "the thing where a lot of people get", "48:27", "confused is like a no-man's land between", "48:30", "kicking and punching when people were", "48:32", "kicking specialists and you see it like", "48:34", "even with elite fighters like Raymond", "48:36", "Daniels", "48:37", "is coming up in his kick boxing career", "48:38", "it took a while before he could make", "48:41", "that smooth transition between kicking", "48:43", "and punching because Raymond would be on", "48:45", "the outside and he was a world-class top", "48:48", "of the food chain karate point fighter", "48:50", "yeah and then got into kickboxing and as", "48:53", "long as he was at a distance he was", "48:55", "fucking people up but in transition", "48:58", "the no-man's land between the kicking in", "49:00", "the punching he looked awkward took a", "49:02", "while before he sort of so some guys", "49:04", "like Joseph Volta Leaney and Nicky hold", "49:06", "skin' they sort of exposed that that gap", "49:08", "the no man's land gap that's a problem a", "49:11", "lot of kickers have yeah they have that", "49:13", "problem the gap from the kicking to the", "49:15", "punching mm-hmm yeah I first sure I", "49:17", "think that's one of the things that I", "49:19", "had to that was one of the things that I", "49:21", "had to really work on and I think", "49:24", "because I enjoy grappling and jujitsu", "49:27", "that I went straight from kicking to", "49:31", "clenched up grappling and I kind of skip", "49:36", "the boxing the boxing part of it how", "49:38", "much boxing you do now um quite a bit", "49:41", "actually is that your main focus yeah", "49:43", "especially off you know off camp we", "49:45", "don't have any you know game plans to", "49:47", "work on we're working boxing and", "49:50", "wrestling now when you say you work in", "49:51", "boxing are you just sparring boxing and", "49:53", "hitting pads boxing or are you trying to", "49:56", "implement that into MMA training", "50:00", "um I would say both we're not sparring", "50:03", "we're not spying right now boxing but I", "50:07", "was working on your hands working on the", "50:08", "hands working on the footwork and then", "50:10", "so we'll just do strictly boxing but", "50:13", "then we'll do like you're saying that", "50:14", "transitions so kicks the boxing and", "50:17", "boxing the kicks and then boxing -", "50:19", "takedowns yeah having things to do when", "50:23", "you don't have to think right knowing", "50:25", "exactly what to do oh I'm in this", "50:27", "position there goes the knee I'm in this", "50:28", "position now I'm throwing a punch when", "50:30", "you see someone going like I got to do", "50:33", "this I think yeah you know the the those", "50:36", "transitions it's it's very it's a that", "50:40", "when you're in the higher higher", "50:42", "pressure situations that's when those", "50:43", "transitions are the most awkward when", "50:45", "you don't have like a conditioned", "50:47", "response yeah and I think that's the", "50:48", "biggest thing that", "50:50", "I've really been able to work on his is", "50:53", "the blending of all of them I feel like",

up to", "57:28", "128", "57:29", "yeah see that's what you're really way", "57:30", "like why is everybody saying she's", "57:32", "fighting at 1:15 she's not fighting at", "57:34", "1:15 like when you say tyron woodley", "57:36", "fights at 1:17 no he doesn't he weighs", "57:39", "170", "57:40", "you know komaru smart he's not 170 he", "57:43", "weighs 170", "57:45", "I for a very small time what maybe it's", "57:50", "just kind of like the old school", "57:52", "mentality or just the the idea of that", "57:55", "being the last challenge that you go", "57:58", "through before you step into the Octagon", "58:00", "that I enjoy and not that I enjoy it but", "58:03", "again you were going back to challenges", "58:05", "and it's like one of those things like", "58:06", "all right like you know take yourself to", "58:10", "this point and if you can get through", "58:12", "that without breaking then me and you", "58:14", "can go to battle right I don't know", "58:16", "there's just something to that for me I", "58:18", "see what you're saying so it's another", "58:21", "challenge like you have a whole there's", "58:23", "a series of challenges there's a", "58:24", "training", "58:25", "there's the mental preparation and", "58:27", "there's a weight cut all these things", "58:28", "together and and I feel like that's like", "58:31", "the last step it's like you know it's a", "58:34", "battle within yourself is that the Death", "58:36", "Star on your forearm what is that it's", "58:44", "an actual silhouette oh oh oh that's so", "58:48", "cool so it's a circular silhouette with", "58:50", "the mountains and trees oh that's", "58:51", "awesome yeah that's really cool that's", "58:53", "very unique thank you it does kind of", "58:55", "look like the Death Star though fucking", "58:59", "Star Wars yeah so the the way cut though", "59:07", "the only problem with it is it's bad for", "59:09", "you yeah I mean I understand that I", "59:10", "don't cut much I probably cut 4 pounds", "59:13", "of water weight well that's when I hit", "59:15", "when I like when I show up fight week", "59:17", "I'm probably like 3 like 4 or 5 pounds", "59:19", "off right but if you just ate normal we", "59:22", "wouldn't you be healthier give if", "59:24", "instead of getting down within 4 pounds", "59:27", "of the weight like because you're gonna", "59:29", "go up to 128 the day fight right so", "59:31", "that's that's an additional 13 pounds", "59:33", "where's that coming from", "59:34", "come from somewhere yeah right so you're", "59:36", "doing I understand that the thought", "59:38", "process is talking to one of the doctors", "59:41", "about it my last", "59:42", "because he was like so strange that you", "59:44", "go through all of this just to be the", "59:45", "same weight the next day now doctors are", "59:47", "so smart it's fucking stupid is what it", "59:54", "is it really is for all for the sport", "59:57", "yeah not you personally but it's what", "59:59", "you have to do if you want to compete in", "60:00", "the sport I guess just because I've been", "60:02", "doing it for so long it's in my head", "60:04", "it's like you know they're only a couple", "60:05", "things you have to do as a fighter", "60:06", "cutting weight is one of them if you", "60:08", "can't do that then you know it is hard I", "60:12", "feel it it's a process that you have to", "60:14", "go through and you have to be mentally", "60:16", "prepared to go through it and if you do", "60:19", "it right it should only be water that", "60:23", "you're cutting even though that's silly", "60:25", "to do I don't know how it's it's silly", "60:27", "to do it's not good it's never good to", "60:29", "just cut that water it's just not it's", "60:31", "not good for you but if you do it if you", "60:35", "if you do it intelligently well you're", "60:36", "not cutting too much weight it's not", "60:38", "that bad but so many people are doing", "60:40", "these brutal 30-pound way cuts I just I", "60:42", "feel like at that point it's it's not a", "60:45", "benefit for you like for some people", "60:47", "they are the bigger person coming into", "60:49", "the to the Octagon the next day but", "60:51", "you're gonna reach a point certain point", "60:53", "where cutting weight is not a benefit", "60:56", "for you maybe I was you know that's if", "60:59", "you can do it you pull it off especially", "61:01", "if you're young and you figure out how", "61:03", "to do it correctly and replenish your", "61:04", "electrolytes you know it is an advantage", "61:06", "bigger but the reality is you're", "61:09", "whatever weight class that is that's not", "61:11", "what you weigh you don't really weigh", "61:13", "that much you weigh it's like it's crazy", "61:15", "like you should be it should be about", "61:17", "skill versus skill it shouldn't be about", "61:19", "who's got the best scientists so I mean", "61:24", "so what do you think you think and ROG", "61:25", "would still be a 150 no no chance no", "61:28", "chance no no no no she's bigger - she", "61:34", "struggles yeah she struggles for 150 but", "61:38", "then you've got Valentina I was like I", "61:40", "think that weight class it's it's really", "61:43", "interesting right when you're talking", "61:45", "about weight classes", "61:46", "if you're talking about the difference", "61:48", "between 105 pounds and 115 pounds it", "61:51", "might only be 10 pounds but it's a giant", "61:53", "percentage of your body weight yeah", "61:55", "and then you look at MMA in the men's", "61:57", "division and you have you know 155 and", "62:00", "you have 170 of that 15 pound gap that's", "62:03", "a big gap it's a giant gap yeah I think", "62:05", "this should be every ten pounds every", "62:08", "ten pounds for men and for women I think", "62:10", "there's a real good argument that should", "62:11", "be every five pounds but if Dana heard", "62:12", "this he would find whatever hello gonna", "62:18", "shut the fuck up Harris he doesn't even", "62:21", "like the idea of a 165 oh my god damn", "62:23", "that's a no-brainer", "62:24", "yeah there is there's plenty of fighters", "62:27", "out there that are willing to fight and", "62:30", "just give them a place to do so in and", "62:32", "guys who would be champions because", "62:33", "that's their real natural weight clip in", "62:35", "betweens", "62:36", "I think that what one FC is doing in", "62:38", "terms of weight cutting is the way to do", "62:40", "it but the other side is they're not", "62:42", "doing the same thing that you sod is", "62:43", "doing in terms of steroids so they're", "62:45", "able to take 100% percent you talk to", "62:49", "guys who compete over there and it's", "62:50", "like yeah I mean there's some some", "62:52", "testing so would you rather fight", "62:54", "somebody that's heavier than you or", "62:56", "somebody that's very it's very good", "62:58", "question because if they were not just", "63:00", "taking steroids but also taking EPO", "63:02", "there's a lot of different shit that", "63:04", "people can take you know they can give", "63:05", "you more like EPO is a scary one because", "63:08", "the person has more gas in their tank to", "63:12", "beat you they have more they can hit you", "63:14", "they can take shots better they can", "63:15", "recover better and then they come after", "63:17", "you and then they they'll have more gas", "63:19", "in the tank than maybe they could put", "63:20", "you away like somebody that's heavier", "63:23", "than me and depleted from cutting water", "63:25", "weight than somebody that was taking", "63:27", "steroids or even for a woman I think for", "63:30", "sure", "63:31", "I think there's for women for women", "63:33", "there's a real argument that once", "63:35", "someone has ever taken steroids that", "63:37", "you've altered your chemistry enough and", "63:39", "your physiology enough that you're", "63:41", "forever going to have some sort of an", "63:42", "advantage so then there's nothing you", "63:44", "can do about that it's quick well maybe", "63:46", "deduct a point before you even get in", "63:48", "the ashes oh that's not even good enough", "63:49", "sony kos people right that's to know how", "63:52", "often you spar um I would say heavy", "63:57", "sparring once a week once a week like so", "63:59", "we do like MMA grappling on Mondays", "64:07", "Tuesdays as a heavy spar", "64:09", "it's the 16-ounce let's throw down", "64:11", "sparring Wednesday's is wrestling", "64:14", "Thursday's is MMA gloves sparring so", "64:19", "it's kind of more just accuracy like", "64:23", "light on the striking here we on the", "64:24", "grappling and then Friday's

"so as well", "77:10", "absolutely there's so much that goes", "77:13", "into fighting that I think people don't", "77:14", "see you know I think it's just like with", "77:16", "anything in life how long it takes to", "77:19", "make a movie versus the actual movie and", "77:22", "and and what goes into that 15 minutes", "77:27", "of a fight that nobody", "77:28", "even knows you know not just eight weeks", "77:30", "but your entire you know training before", "77:34", "that you know for me it's you know I've", "77:37", "been doing martial arts since I was ten", "77:38", "and fighting professionally for over ten", "77:41", "years and so it's an accumulation of all", "77:45", "of those things but each fight presents", "77:49", "its own problem and if you're not", "77:50", "mentally prepared for it if you're not", "77:53", "prepared physically if you're not", "77:55", "prepared like spiritually emotionally", "77:56", "like hormonal II if that's even a word", "78:02", "everything has to line up that one night", "78:05", "those 15 minutes or twenty five minutes", "78:07", "in order for you to win and you can", "78:10", "definitely beat yourself before you even", "78:12", "step

like my secret sauce right but", "78:22", "how he explains is this everybody knows", "78:25", "what you're supposed to do what you have", "78:27", "to put in the work just like physically", "78:29", "you have to put in the work like I can", "78:30", "sit up here I can tell you what I do but", "78:32", "it's not going to make a difference", "78:33", "unless you actually put in the work to", "78:36", "to just strengthen your mind mentally", "78:40", "but we do a lot of so your opponent it's", "78:47", "not like you can practice barring them", "78:49", "because you've never fought them before", "78:52", "and so how he explains it to me is it's", "78:57", "just a repetition you know of the mind", "79:00", "and so when so you just have to really I", "79:06", "think explore your imagination and for", "79:11", "us we we practice the fight in our head", "79:15", "and some days are harder than others", "79:18", "sometimes I win the fight in the first", "79:21", "10 seconds of the of the round sometimes", "79:23", "it's all five rounds and and it's a war", "79:25", "and and I win that way but you have to", "79:29", "you have to see yourself going through", "79:31", "every different scenario and there are", "79:32", "millions in MMA and you just practice", "79:35", "them over and over and over so it's", "79:37", "essentially just going through that or", "79:39", "do you do you prepare your mindset is", "79:46", "for for for me I have a set of power", "79:50", "words that's what he calls them power", "79:51", "words one tell us what they are and so", "79:56", "yeah

"80:30", "well", "80:30", "mm-hmm but the one word is is not just a", "80:38", "word it's like a whole thought process", "80:39", "so when I say one word it it feeds into", "80:43", "an entire feeling if that makes any", "80:46", "sense", "80:46", "hmm and so instead of having to have a", "80:51", "conversation in my mind which takes way", "80:54", "too long I just say confidence and it", "80:57", "takes me where I need to be and", "81:00", "eventually I won't you shouldn't even", "81:03", "have to do that you should just be in", "81:05", "the moment and just allow your your mind", "81:10", "to connect with your body mm-hmm", "81:13", "do you do any meditating at all yeah I", "81:17", "mean I would say it's kind of a", "81:19", "meditative I I would say it's more of a", "81:24", "practice than it is a meditation because", "81:26", "I'm not trying to clear my mind I'm", "81:28", "really trying to focus on something", "81:31", "specific right but outside of that you", "81:33", "don't

I", "82:30", "remember doing it one time and I kind of", "82:35", "drifted off and I remember almost waking", "82:37", "up and feeling like I was like floating", "82:39", "in space yeah sure almost like kind of", "82:41", "panicked because I I didn't have a sense", "82:44", "of where my what my where my body was", "82:46", "yeah that's what triggers is weird", "82:48", "psychedelic states but if you can find", "82:51", "one and use it on a regular basis it", "82:53", "works great with visualization and a lot", "82:55", "of athletes UFC and other sports as well", "82:58", "they use it for visualization like", "83:01", "they'll think about passes like throwing", "83:03", "a pass yeah and then watching someone", "83:05", "catch it they'll they'll visualize", "83:07", "things and go through the the technique", "83:09", "in their head and I've done that what", "83:11", "you just do as well done that with", "83:13", "certain techniques that I was really", "83:14", "trying to learn you could do it as if", "83:17", "you're rolling you know like you just", "83:19", "like picturing your body going through", "83:21", "the different positions yeah yeah that's", "83:24", "basically

so many things going on in my", "83:59", "life with being a mother and a wife that", "84:03", "sometimes I can use the distractions as", "84:05", "an excuse to justify why I'm not getting", "84:07", "things", "84:08", "done or this or that and so that's", "84:11", "something that I've really been working", "84:12", "hard at is to not to not use those as", "84:15", "excuses but more so to to to allow the", "84:19", "distractions to happen and and and", "84:21", "choose to stay focused anyways hmm", "84:24", "there are there's quite a few women's", "84:28", "MMA fighters now but it's still

"100:51", "frustrating though that you have gone", "100:53", "down in rankings even though absolutely", "100:56", "and I just I don't know why they would", "100:59", "argue for me not to get the belt to go", "101:03", "for it you know everything is there the", "101:05", "storyline is there yeah um it would be", "101:09", "you know technique versus strength speed", "101:12", "versus power this is

fight for and Josh to", "102:43", "showcase her knockout power because KK", "102:46", "is a pressure fighter and she", "102:49", "instinctively will go forward and throw", "102:51", "when she is in danger and sometimes it", "102:55", "works and sometimes it does it you know", "102:57", "yeah and she throws hard obviously she", "103:01", "put you wanna you know she buckled you", "103:04", "on a couple times she's dangerous she's", "103:06", "she warned against rose yeah", "103:09", "you know so but yeah I think styles make", "103:15", "fights and that's that's what happened", "103:19", "with her in that situation what do you", "103:22", "think and Raj is unusually strong yeah", "103:25", "like freakish you know like you see when", "103:28", "she grabs ahold of people and then dumps", "103:29", "him on their ass like she's she's", "103:31", "freakishly powerful to be able to like", "103:33", "hit that single and elevate Rose that", "103:37", "way and drop her on her head when you", "103:39", "think about how strong you have to be to", "103:41", "do that it's beautiful yeah beautiful to", "103:44", "watch um she's a beast", "103:46", "great technique as well no no doubt", "103:48", "about it but man horse power that's her", "103:51", "butter and I figure I honestly I I gave", "103:54", "it to rose to win the fight it only", "103:58", "takes a split second though to lose your", "104:00", "focus and to get picked up and slammed", "104:02", "down like that and then the fights over", "104:04", "for the division that's actually", "104:06", "probably good", "104:07", "because it's exciting because it mixes", "104:08", "things up a bit you have Johanna who is", "104:10", "the dominant champion for so long Rose", "104:12", "comes along to Pete's her and then", "104:14", "Jessica dumps Rose in her head beats her", "104:16", "in a fight that she was losing I mean", "104:18", "there's like it's a hotbed of talent", "104:20", "it's a 115-pound women's division is", "104:22", "amazing right now yeah it really is", "104:24", "yeah yeah and so that's what I'm letting", "104:29", "that's exactly what I want and in the", "104:32", "meantime we just we just get better", "104:34", "beautiful weight we train and we get", "104:35", "better I feel like what's gonna beat and", "104:38", "Rajas um I mean Rose had rose was doing", "104:43", "exactly what she was doing I think that", "104:45", "role is actually kind of got a bit just", "104:48", "just a little bit complacent and and", "104:50", "like she's even said it herself it was a", "104:53", "moment of of laziness a lapse yeah well", "104:57", "it's easy to say I mean so hard after", "104:58", "the fact to try to figure out what went", "105:00", "wrong and why it went wrong what was", "105:02", "going on in her head but clearly it was", "105:04", "not lacing up the legs when she's", "105:05", "attacking the Kimora she was elevated", "105:07", "and dumped and and and I'm sure for a", "105:11", "lot of her camp she's she was able to do", "105:13", "that with with her teammates and", "105:16", "probably pop off good submissions you", "105:18", "know but in the moment of a fight for a", "105:21", "championship belt in your hometown", "105:24", "against a person that's bread and butter", "105:27", "is a piledrive you know it it's just", "105:31", "like stacks up against you well
