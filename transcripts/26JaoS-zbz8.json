not to spin tackle it's", "37:14", "a good question and I think that's the", "37:18", "that's the I don't know it's kind of", "37:20", "like using spin tackles like this", "37:24", "workman it's it's it's like a", "37:26", "blue-collar way of doing it that's my", "37:29", "perception of and and then people who", "37:32", "are fly fisherman and I've seen these", "37:33", "guys in action you know

of", "39:15", "overwhelmed my fishing time but there's", "39:17", "something about the people that get into", "39:18", "fly-fishing that it's not just fishing", "39:21", "one of the weird things about", "39:23", "fly-fishing is a lot of them let the", "39:25", "fish go there's a lot of catch and", "39:27", "release going on with fly-fishing which", "39:29", "yeah I mean and I'm I like that to you I", "39:31", "mean I used to a lot of them go I get", "39:34", "that but I'm a little I'm a little", "39:36", "tormented on that you're putting a", "39:38", "fucking hook through something's head", "39:40", "and you're gonna let it go like how", "39:42", "about just not doing that if you really", "39:44", "love the fish how about just fish with", "39:46", "no hook at all and they bite it you know", "39:48", "you know you would have had them that's", "39:50", "probably fair yeah that's probably the", "39:52", "way to go it's weird that we would be", "39:54", "it's this weird thing that we have in", "39:56", "our head we were trying to activate", "39:59", "those reward systems that were there in", "40:01", "place in order to keep ourselves fed", "40:04", "right like if you there's a thing that", "40:06", "happens when you catch a fish you've", "40:08", "seen like I've seen with my little kids", "40:10", "I've taken my daughter's fishing and", "40:13", "when they catch a fish they have this", "40:14", "look in their face like oh I got it I", "40:16", "got it I got it oh yeah yeah like this", "40:19", "is it super exciting when they pull it", "40:20", "out of the boat and then the fact that", "40:22", "they're gonna get to eat it later", "40:23", "there's some weird primal DNA thing that", "40:27", "gets activated when you catch something", "40:28", "and I think that's what these fly", "40:31", "fishermen that are letting the fish go", "40:32", "or trying to do they're just little", "40:34", "junkies for that that that feel that", "40:36", "feeling that DNA activation that reward", "40:40", "system thing and obviously it's", "40:42", "difficult and obviously there's a lot of", "40:44", "tremendous amount of skill and finesse", "40:45", "involved and fly casting roll casting", "40:49", "and trying to place this fly right in", "40:52", "this little pool and drag it with the", "40:54", "current and get that nasty trout to bite", "40:56", "onto it but you also want to own it you", "41:00", "want to have them and let him go like", "41:02", "you don't want to like say I could have", "41:03", "had you but there's no hook on the side", "41:05", "of fly fish yeah you want to know you", "41:07", "got it you don't want to know he bit you", "41:09", "want to know you got it so no one goes", "41:11", "fly fishing with no hook they go with a", "41:13",

"41:22", "good that's not good you're trying to", "41:25", "ruin fisherman fish", "41:26", "for all catch-and-release fishermen I am", "41:29", "NOT an Irish I supported 100% and I've", "41:31", "done it I'm a hypocrite in that regard I", "41:33", "have done some catch and release but I", "41:35", "feel like there is a weirdness to it", "41:38", "that it's this why yeah you're not", "41:43", "eating it like why how about you can't", "41:45", "just look at them no you gotta catch", "41:47", "them catch them and I have them and then", "41:50", "let them go but how are you gonna look", "41:52", "at them if you don't look at them in the", "41:54", "water here's the thing a good percentage", "41:57", "I don't know what the number is", "41:58", "especially when you're like salmon", "42:00", "fishing and you're using like heavy", "42:01", "tackle a good percentage if you catch", "42:03", "and release and they're those fish are", "42:03", "never gonna make it catch them with a", "42:06", "big lure barbed hooks you get them deep", "42:08", "in the throat you pull them out their", "42:10", "gills are bleeding I mean that's yeah", "42:13", "that's that's the scenario that you", "42:15", "don't like yeah catch and in that", "42:17", "essence most fishermen I think would", "42:19", "know that you can't turn that fish back", "42:21", "loose but you have to sometimes you do", "42:23", "have to something yeah but you have to", "42:25", "turn them loose cuz it's the law", "42:26", "it's the regulations and you turn it", "42:27", "loose and you watch it swim away like", "42:29", "well the fuckers got about a 40% chance", "42:31", "yeah ya know and everybody hates that", "42:34", "yeah it's the worst but but they still", "42:37", "want that feeling I guess a weird the", "42:39", "catching the fish things a weird feeling", "42:40", "apparently that's that way with", "42:42", "butterfly catchers too because human", "42:45", "beings used to be insectivores really", "42:47", "yeah I was listening to this lecture", "42:49", "once by Terence Mckenna and he was", "42:51", "talking about that", "42:53", "Terrence Kent McKenna the great", "42:54", "psychedelic author and lecturer he was", "42:58", "talking about how he was really into", "43:01", "butterfly catching at one point in time", "43:02", "and the odd thing is that it activates", "43:05", "this very primal reward system in your", "43:08", "body the same way catching a fish would", "43:10", "that it's like because human beings used", "43:12", "to be insectivores we used to eat a lot", "43:14", "of insects so when you do find some rare", "43:17", "butterfly they even after for months and", "43:19", "months and you have the opportunity to", "43:21", "drop in it so excited about them that's", "43:25", "a weird sort of trophy hunting butterfly", "43:27", "hunting too because that you're allowed", "43:29", "to do that you could take that little", "43:31", "fucker dry them out and put them on a", "43:32", "wall somewhere and nobody thinks you're", "43:34", "a barbarian like people are real racist", "43:38", "when it comes to what animals are", "43:39", "to be dead I mean yeah pigs and cows", "43:44", "were screwed yeah yeah pigs and cows", "43:47", "both that me but more so bugs you know", "43:50", "yeah", "43:51", "oh no ya nobody likes bugs I can well I", "43:53", "sort of I went to an ashram once and", "43:55", "this lady who was running the ashram had", "43:57", "a can of raid and she was talk to me", "44:01", "about the ant problem that they have and", "44:03", "I was like hold up see each spray he", "44:06", "sprayed these ants with poison and she's", "44:09", "like yeah and I go see kill the ants I", "44:11", "go isn't that contrary to what you're", "44:13", "teaching which is like sometimes there's", "44:15", "just things you have to do because", "44:16", "otherwise the ants will get in our food", "44:18", "and okay like huh this is odd you're in", "44:24", "an odd crossroads here lady", "44:26", "yeah you're a Buddhist living in an", "44:28", "ashram with a can of poison that you use", "44:31", "for living beings you don't like being", "44:32", "around you I have nothing but if she was", "44:38", "like if she had like cats that she was", "44:41", "killing with a baseball bat everybody", "44:42", "would be mad though she'd be in jail", "44:43", "yeah weird right yeah with weird rules", "44:47", "sorry to take you down this world no no", "44:49", "this is very interesting to me I didn't", "44:51", "know that human beings you should be", "44:52", "insectivore yeah apparently well that's", "44:56", "one of the things that they talk about", "44:57", "in terms of the future of protein that", "45:00", "insects provide very complex complete", "45:04", "proteins and they can provide it to", "45:06", "large amounts of people fairly", "45:08", "inexpensively and so cricket protein is", "45:11", "very popular to hell if you know this a", "45:12", "lot of people eat cricket protein yeah", "45:16", "they've cricket bars and shit cricket", "45:18", "bars yeah they make bars out of crickets", "45:20", "yeah cricket protein

that is that pre-made there's", "45:49", "the cricket bars from the powder I think", "45:51", "it would look more pal", "45:52", "if they didn't have a picture of a", "45:53", "cricket like crawling out of it yeah", "45:55", "hide that shit so there's the there's", "45:57", "the cricket protein powder that's crap", "45:59", "they cooked the cricket grind those", "46:01", "little fuckers up and turn it into", "46:02", "protein powder and it's apparently has a", "46:04", "complete amino acid profile it's easy to", "46:07", "digest and it doesn't make people feel", "46:09", "bad like look at that look at the the", "46:11", "grams of protein per 100 gallons of", "46:16", "water how much you can get for a cow", "46:18", "you only get six grams of protein for a", "46:20", "hundred grams of water or 100 gallons of", "46:22", "water but for crickets you get 71 grams", "46:25", "of protein for the same amount of water", "46:27", "Wow so it's more than ten times the", "46:29", "amount of protein so you could and I", "46:32", "don't think it has near the impact on", "46:34", "the environment in terms of like raising", "46:37", "them they don't have like a lot of the", "46:39", "waste products and the the issues that", "46:41", "cows have methane I smells I this is", "46:46", "this is amazing", "46:47", "sorry dude I've had crickets before man", "46:54", "I was in Mexico and they

okay these are actually", "47:16", "pretty good they're like with this", "47:18", "they're essentially related but a lot of", "47:21", "bugs are related to shellfish whereas", "47:24", "like we found on fear factor that if", "47:26", "you're allergic to shrimp", "47:27", "you're also allergic to roaches really", "47:30", "yeah we found that out because we made a", "47:32", "duty roaches and and he

doing some", "49:08", "other things TV things whatever but", "49:11", "waking up to that on the news is not a", "49:13", "not a fun thing to watch and I'm so", "49:15", "heartbroken for everybody
