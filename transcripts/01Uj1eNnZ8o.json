"because someone has to fill that", "135:16", "position and they're not about nostalgia", "135:17", "they're about who does the best job in", "135:19", "that position shouldn't the UFC be that", "135:21", "way but it's not that the UFC doesn't", "135:23", "know who does the best job in that", "135:24", "position until they set you up with", "135:25", "somebody when they see over and over and", "135:27", "over again then we've salt but it give", "135:30", "me six but the argument is he's not", "135:31", "getting crushed he's not gettin spark'd", "135:33", "out he's not getting knocked out he's", "135:34", "just not as good as he used to be no", "135:36", "it's not a good argument but he's not", "135:38", "he's not as good as you used to be yeah", "135:39", "no I'm not saying I'm not arguing just", "135:41", "answer why do you think it's still at", "135:43", "the UFC in his opponent I don't know why", "135:48", "the because he's still a draw maybe yeah", "135:50", "that's a good question because because", "135:52", "right now the respect is it out of", "135:53", "respect like what is it what he's done", "135:55", "for the game he's earned the right to go", "135:56", "out on his own note but the stakes are", "135:59", "so high in fighting it's different than", "136:00", "basketball", "136:01", "I don't know whose job it's and I don't", "136:03", "have the answer and I wish I did I don't", "136:05", "know it's it's the most heartbreaking", "136:07", "thing in sports I think I agree and I", "136:10", "think with BJ if he would have found and", "136:12", "I don't know BJ well enough but if you", "136:14", "would have found a passion like I did", "136:15", "with stand-up or podcasting or something", "136:18", "else you probably would have been out", "136:19", "never come back", "136:20", "maybe but the thrill of yeah I mean he's", "136:24", "a multiple time world champion the", "136:26", "thrill of BJ when he was in his prime", "136:27", "it's probably indescribable", "136:29", "like what brings Nate Diaz back you know", "136:31", "there's money in the bank what's gonna", "136:32", "bring Connor back yeah it's not money", "136:34", "yeah those guys were born fighters", "136:37", "they're natural-born fighters these what", "136:39", "they do and that's that's what makes him", "136:40", "feel alive so I don't know", "136:42", "yeah the excitement the thrill the", "136:44", "fuckin I mean and look we're all gonna", "136:47", "die sorry", "136:50", "when people say you should look out for", "136:52", "their health well then we should stop",

argument for", "137:10", "that right like this is a give a small", "137:12", "window the experience is life do you", "137:15", "want but yeah with a guy like BJ Penn", "137:17", "the reality is there should probably be", "137:20", "a number of fights that you lose in the", "137:22", "UFC where you just get cut you speak", "137:25", "three", "137:26", "was it a signed in paper thing no but", "137:30", "man when you've lost two which I did", "137:32", "that third one Joe Silva would tell your", "137:34", "management he told my manager like me", "137:35", "Lex McMahon goes no with this one
