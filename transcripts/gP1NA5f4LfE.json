just", "05:00", "got to figure out how to make it 20 25", "05:01", "miles and so I just you know went", "05:07", "completely psycho and ratcheted up the", "05:09", "training and and then in October of 2005", "05:14", "I did my first Catalina swim wow that's", "05:17", "got to be a pretty good feeling though", "05:20", "when you're done that you are capable", "05:22", "pushing yourself to what most people", "05:25", "think is an impossible distance yeah I", "05:28", "thought I mean people you asked a moment", "05:30", "ago why do you do this I would say that", "05:31", "in life velocity means very little", "05:35", "acceleration means everything so what do", "05:38", "I mean by that right like if you're", "05:39", "going 650 miles an hour in an airplane", "05:42", "you don't actually feel

especially", "06:06", "amazing is that six hours earlier you", "06:09", "thought you were gonna die so you start", "06:12", "these swims in the middle of the night", "06:13", "to avoid the shipping

now I like I wasn't", "07:14", "used to how to keep the salt water out", "07:16", "of my mouth right so then I was like", "07:18", "puking my guts out and then my if while", "07:21", "you were swimming yeah you got yeah yeah", "07:23", "how does that work you just stop and", "07:26", "puke and then keep swimming Wow and then", "07:29", "but then my tongue started to get really", "07:32", "swollen from the saltwater because again", "07:34", "as I would learn later on I would go on", "07:36", "to do many more of these swims but what", "07:38", "I learned is the importance of spitting", "07:41", "the water out of your mouth very quickly", "07:42", "so in a in a freshwater pool or lake you", "07:45", "get away with more but in the ocean you", "07:48", "swallow that saltwater you're gonna get", "07:49", "sick as hell", "07:50", "so all this stuff's going on so by 5:00", "07:54", "in the morning you've been swimming for", "07:55", "five hours you're getting cold you're I", "08:00", "mean you know frankly just", "08:01", "physiologically like your cortisol", "08:03", "levels are at an eighth or you're just", "08:05", "you feel horrible it's like it's a", "08:07", "really

"said I mean I've never experienced that", "08:26", "but I was explaining the other day to a", "08:29", "friend of mine about this camping trip", "08:31", "that we went on in Montana I went it was", "08:32", "like 9 degrees outside it was freezing", "08:34", "cold we stayed out there for five six", "08:37", "days and then when we finally got to a", "08:40", "hotel room I took a shower and it was", "08:41", "the most amazing shower", "08:43", "experience tread life and that's a small", "08:46", "right now but you take a shower every", "08:47", "day and it's a big deal yeah when you do", "08:49", "it in that setting or or think about the", "08:51", "the meal you've had if you've been fast", "08:53", "similar situation yet we're starving or", "08:55", "lost at sea yeah yeah yeah I can't", "08:58", "imagine that's a so now that you've done", "09:01", "how many of these have you done these", "09:02", "crazy you swim races or swim I mean", "09:05", "calls them several yeah they're usually", "09:07", "these major major ones are not racist", "09:10", "you you're you're on your own you have", "09:11", "to you go to the Federation that", "09:14", "oversees that body of water and you say", "09:16", "hey I want to do this and then you you", "09:17", "know you go through all the channels to", "09:19", "do it like they have to have an observer", "09:20", "there and they you follow these", "09:22", "officials so that you can be registered", "09:23", "as someone who's actually completed it", "09:25", "right and someone's there to make sure", "09:26", "you didn't you know you did it correctly", "09:29", "I don't know I've probably done all in", "09:32", "probably like a dozen of these but", "09:34", "probably like six of them really long", "09:36", "ones what's the longest well I that's a", "09:40", "good question what does the Maui one was", "09:42", "twenty miles there and back so forty", "09:44", "miles total no it's a the Maui channel", "09:47", "is a 10-mile channel so round-trip is", "09:49", "twenty the bigger question is time in", "09:52", "the water because you rarely get to swim", "09:54", "these in a straight line so the Maui", "09:55", "lanai one I wanted to go Maui lanai", "09:58", "Molokai Maui to do the triangle mhm and", "10:02", "that would have been thirty miles as a", "10:03", "crow flies but we just you know boat", "10:06", "captain wasn't willing to do it at night", "10:08", "because the tiger sharks and during the", "10:10", "daytime we couldn't physiologically", "10:13", "figure out how one could suffer against", "10:16", "those the wind because the wind gets so", "10:18", "brutal in the middle of the day so even", "10:20", "the one that I did which was just the", "10:22", "there and back I ended up swimming for", "10:25", "twelve hours because on the the first", "10:28", "way crossing where there was no wind it", "10:30", "took me four hours and then it took", "10:33", "eight hours to get back because I was", "10:35", "swimming like the hypotenuse of a", "10:37", "triangle right like currents going this", "10:40", "way so I had to swim this way just to go", "10:42", "in a straight line and I still kid I", "10:44", "almost missed Maui Jesus prayer so I", "10:48", "almost got swept out to Molokai just", "10:50", "because the current was about 1.7 knots", "10:53", "which is about as fast as I can swim", "10:55", "maybe two knots", "10:57", "fuck that is a ridiculous thing man why", "11:02", "are you doing this", "11:04", "this is maniacal well I don't do it", "11:06", "anymore I mean it was certainly it was", "11:09", "an amazing season of my life but I think", "11:12", "once my daughter was born which was ten", "11:16", "years ago this summer that's when I", "11:20", "I only probably did two of these after", "11:22", "she was born because then the training", "11:24", "just got so I just you got to live in", "11:26", "the water if you want to do this sport", "11:28", "like you got a including the winter you", "11:31", "know like you know even in San Diego", "11:33", "where I live it's still you know fifty", "11:35", "five degrees in the water and you're", "11:37", "gonna spend three four hours a day in", "11:38", "the water freezing you know it's just so", "11:42", "that was like you know I just don't have", "11:43", "the the drive to spend twenty five hours", "11:46", "a week swimming what was the what was", "11:51", "going on in San Diego when that guy got", "11:52", "bit in half by a shark couple years back", "11:54", "they were training for something yeah", "11:56", "that's a funny you remember that that", "11:58", "was May of 2008 I remember that like it", "12:01", "was yesterday so at the time I lived in", "12:03", "San Francisco and this is actually just", "12:05", "before I swam the Maui thing now that I", "12:07", "think about it that was 10 years ago I", "12:08", "swam the Maui thing in June of oh six a", "12:11", "June of oh eight so I'm doing all my", "12:14", "training in a swimming pool up in San", "12:16", "Francisco because I don't want to", "12:19", "acclimate to very cold water I actually", "12:21", "want to be in warm water but I needed", "12:23", "one long ocean swim of like 14 or 15", "12:26", "miles as my like last training swim so I", "12:29", "came down to San Diego to do it and just", "12:31", "by bad luck I came down a few days after", "12:34", "that guy was killed now this was a guy I", "12:38", "didn't know him but he was a triathlete", "12:39", "training with a triathlon group that", "12:42", "they would go out and swim every morning", "12:43", "and I know the beach exactly where it", "12:45", "happened in Solana Beach and", "12:47", "unfortunately like most people who get", "12:49", "attacked by great whites they have a", "12:51", "very they always attack the same way", "12:53", "which is below and behind stealth bite", "12:57", "up and and then they retreat so they're", "12:59", "trying to basically injure the prey so", "13:00", "that their prey exsanguinate sand then", "13:02", "they take off and then they wait till", "13:03", "you bleed out so they never saw the", "13:06", "shark but you could tell from the bite", "13:08", "marks it was", "13:09", "I actually had a friend who was on the", "13:12", "beach and saw him when he came out and", "13:15", "he was basically dead when he got to", "13:17", "shore he had he had bled to death", "13:18", "the problem is though in this case the", "13:20", "shark had bit him and cut through his", "13:21", "femoral arteries and veins and the", "13:24", "saltwater prevents you from having any", "13:25", "hemostasis so it exacerbates the blood", "13:28", "loss so that's generally how folks", "13:32", "perish when they're great when out of", "13:34", "the water you know a bunch of other", "13:37", "swimmers came to his rescue and luckily", "13:39", "that commotion prevents the Sharks from", "13:41", "wanting they come back so three days", "13:44", "later I go out and I'm swimming at that", "13:46", "Beach because I swam from my training", "13:48", "swim was La Hoya up to Solana Beach and", "13:51", "back and I got to tell you like three", "13:55", "days after a guy dies where you're", "13:56", "swimming it is it was about one of the", "13:59", "most mentally challenging training swims", "14:03", "to be like because you can't see like", "14:06", "the water at that part of the beach is", "14:08", "so murky you know and you're only a", "14:10", "couple hundred yards offshore that like", "14:13", "you can barely see your hands when", "14:14", "you're swimming and so you're just", "14:17", "thinking is this the day I'm not", "14:24", "interested in that Jay I can't see why", "14:26", "yeah there's just something about sharks", "14:28", "- I mean they're to me one of the most", "14:30", "terrifying things but it's first of all", "14:32", "we're so inept in the water I mean even", "14:35", "a person like you is a great swimmer", "14:37", "yeah we're joke yeah what we are in", "14:39", "comparison to what they are it's just", "14:41", "you're you're throwing yourself into the", "14:43", "world of a super predator and to know", "14:47", "that one just jacked a person just a few", "14:49", "days before and you're out there", "14:50", "swimming around yeah although I will say", "14:53", "this you know when it's all said and", "14:54", "done all of the close encounters I've", "14:56", "had probably the scariest moment I've", "14:58", "ever had in the water was doing a swim", "15:00", "from Santa Rosa to Santa Barbara so", "15:02", "Santa Rosa Island which is the second", "15:04", "for this North Channel Island you got", "15:06", "Santa Miguel", "15:07", "Santa Rosa Santa Cruz and Anacapa", "15:08", "represent the top four Channel Islands", "15:10", "so we did this November swim it was a", "15:14", "nighttime thing against woman from Santa", "15:16", "Rosa Island to Santa Barbara and", "15:19", "at about 5:00 in the morning maybe 6:00", "15:22", "in the morning you're just starting to", "15:23", "get enough light where you can see and", "15:25", "you're out there so you really have", "15:26", "amazing visibility and I look down", "15:28", "probably 40 feet and I see this enormous", "15:33", "thing swimming like this which is how", "15:37", "sharks swim and I see the dorsal fin in", "15:40", "the position that freaks me out and the", "15:42", "tails this way but all of that is shark", "15:45", "right and I like you know like lift up", "15:49", "out of the water kind of hyperventilate", "15:50", "for a second and I'm thinking to myself", "15:51", "all right you got to make a judgment", "15:53", "call here if that's really a great white", "15:54", "you probably ought to get out of the", "15:56", "water but if you the moment you are out", "15:58", "of the water that's it the swim is over", "16:00", "like you just spent like months doing", "16:02", "this like it's one so then I convinced", "16:06", "myself and I think I'm right I think it", "16:07", "was a dolphin on its side because a", "16:10", "dolphin on its side would its fin would", "16:11", "get tail fin would be the same way and", "16:14", "it could swim that way so in the end I", "16:16", "just kept swimming but I mean that", "16:17", "scared the shit out of me well they have", "16:19", "seen quite a few of them off the coast", "16:20", "of Malibu there's tons there's no", "16:23", "question that like they're there they", "16:25", "are way more plentiful than we realize", "16:27", "and all you do is talk to the fishermen", "16:29", "like the fishermen will tell you they're", "16:31", "like you like off Coronado I mean it's", "16:34", "like there's non-stop great whites", "16:36", "really oh yeah", "16:37", "why are you freaking me out Peter the", "16:42", "good news is they see us all the time", "16:44", "and most the time they realize we're not", "16:46", "what they want yeah they want seals yeah", "16:48", "that whenever they attack us they're", "16:50", "making a mistake", "16:51", "now is there a like a suit you can wear", "16:54", "like a kevlar suit to protect protects", "16:56", "you from getting bitten in half no but", "16:59", "this is so funny you bring this up I", "17:01", "became obsessed with this thing called", "17:03", "the UH what was it called Christ you you", "17:09", "put the thing on your ankle like you had", "17:11", "like a little velcro thing you'd wrap it", "17:12", "on your ankle on had a tail like this", "17:13", "long you know like four foot long thing", "17:16", "and it was charged and it sends out an", "17:19", "electrical impulse that disturbs the", "17:23", "shit out of the Sharks the Sharks nose", "17:25", "is an organ that senses

a problem because of the drag no", "18:12", "because it would sound silly but it", "18:15", "would come up and zap you in the nuts", "18:17", "it's like so it became unbearable to", "18:20", "practice

on", "19:07", "earth that are just overrun with", "19:08", "predators and terrifying like predator", "19:11", "prey activity Catalina Island is one of", "19:16", "the top spots in the world I was like", "19:17", "what are you talking about he's like I'm", "19:19", "telling you man the shark fishing off", "19:22", "Catalina Island is fucking insane and", "19:24", "then I watched a television show just", "19:26", "you know synchronicity a couple days", "19:29", "later and it was these guys shark", "19:31", "fishing off of Catalina I was like what", "19:33", "in the fuck I could have never guessed", "19:35", "they're catching Makos mostly yeah and", "19:38", "and it's actually my recollection", "19:40", "because we swam around Catalina once as", "19:43", "well the backside is way more aggressive", "19:45", "than the front", "19:46", "the side that faces the Pacific side", "19:49", "they'd rather that's right yeah there's", "19:51", "way morning so I think that's exactly", "19:53",

"20:38", "there is that what it is yeah so", "20:39", "apparently there was a movie that was", "20:41", "made there back in the 20s or something", "20:43", "like that just let a bunch of Buffalo", "20:44", "well they had a bunch of Buffalo yet for", "20:46", "the movie and I guess they never liked", "20:47", "the corral totally overrun with Buffalo", "20:51", "well there was one of the Channel", "20:53", "Islands that they had actually turned", "20:55", "into a bow hunting destination like they", "20:58", "had brought in a bunch of deer I think", "21:01", "they brought in stags and a bunch of", "21:02", "weird exotic shit and they put him on", "21:04", "this island I think they even had elk", "21:06", "and then biologists just weren't having", "21:09", "it they're like this is just so out of", "21:11", "whack yeah and those so they had them", "21:13", "eradicated and the way they do that is", "21:16", "it's pretty gruesome they just gunned", "21:18", "down from the air and just leave the", "21:20", "bodies yeah they just decided that they", "21:22", "were did invasive species regardless of", "21:24", "how ya Leah below might have been to", "21:26", "people that wanted to go there and eat", "21:27", "them", "21:28", "you know they just decided just for the", "21:30", "ecosystem alone just there's no", "21:32", "predators there and they weren't gonna", "21:34", "turn the fuckin island the Wild Kingdom", "21:36", "and bring wolves or something in there", "21:38", "yeah it would be pretty goddamn crazy", "21:39", "imagine if there was an island you go", "21:41",

"21:48", "for hunting or something like that they", "21:50", "could have been productive well out it", "21:51", "they that's an interesting perspective", "21:54", "so biologists look at it in terms of the", "21:57", "entire ecosystem right they look at in", "21:59", "terms of the play", "22:00", "ants the amount of waste fecal waste", "22:03", "that these animals are leaving behind", "22:05", "the fact they're literally eating", "22:07", "everything that they can on the Scion", "22:09", "they're not supposed to be there and", "22:11", "then they're competing with whatever", "22:13", "things are

"22:28", "themselves are kind of amazing I mean", "22:31", "most people know of Catalina but you", "22:32", "know there's eight of them and now two", "22:34", "of them you can't step foot on", "22:36", "I think it's allowed to know San", "22:38", "Clemente and San Nicholas there are", "22:40", "military bases oh so we tried to do a", "22:42", "swim from San Nicolas back to Los", "22:44",

"22:54", "hey is there any way we can because you", "22:56", "officially do have to start a swim you", "22:58", "have to be able to touch dry land and be", "23:00", "out of the water and they're like yeah", "23:01", "you can't come on the island so in the", "23:03", "end what we decided was we were just", "23:05", "gonna do a stealth landing you know by", "23:07", "the time they came down and screamed at", "23:08", "us and shot it as we'd have been off the", "23:10", "island", "23:11", "but then we got to the island now the", "23:14", "other big thing of its and nick is", "23:15", "that's real shark territory because", "23:16", "that's where the elephant seals live and", "23:19", "so when we got out there we literally", "23:22", "could not get to shore because of the", "23:24", "elephant seals like we're 200 yards off", "23:27", "San Nick and you know this after had", "23:29", "taken a full two days to get out there I", "23:31", "mean this place is really hard to get to", "23:33", "because the water is brutal and you're", "23:34", "not in a huge boat and yeah you're", "23:38", "looking at like thousand-pound elephant", "23:39", "seals that are just like licking their", "23:40", "chops looking at you trying to get in", "23:42", "the water what would they do with you I", "23:44", "I didn't want to find out but they're", "23:46", "not predatory I mean I don't think I",

ass", "23:56", "and pulls her into the water", "23:57", "gerrae see that Jaime yeah and I didn't", "24:00", "think that seals ever did something like", "24:02", "that before I don't know I did see a", "24:04", "special once about how dolphins could be", "24:06", "kind of aggressive with each other like", "24:08", "they could harm you know they could", "24:10", "leave this this seal is sitting there", "24:12", "and this girl", "24:14", "hmm the sea line actually look at this", "24:16", "it comes up and they think that's secret", "24:19", "so cute yeah but it I think it was", "24:25", "probably looking for a handout and these", "24:27", "people weren't giving it to her oh and", "24:29", "then she turns her butter yeah fuck that", "24:38", "I bet I'd be right back", "24:42", "fill

they don't allow hunting for", "25:37", "mountain goats on the weekends because", "25:40", "there's so many people hiking and going", "25:43", "that they don't want people killing", "25:44", "these mountain goats in front of them", "25:46", "because people freak out even though", "25:48", "they have decided that they have to", "25:49", "control the population and kill a", "25:51", "certain number of them but so many", "25:55", "people go out there that these things", "25:59", "aren't scared of people so it's created", "26:01", "this really weird situation where if you", "26:04", "are hunting them you're you're almost", "26:07", "hunting something that's domesticated", "26:09", "people feed them Cheetos so much so that", "26:12", "a friend of mine was talking about it", "26:14", "that he was up there with his daughter", "26:16", "his daughter opened up a bag of cheetos", "26:19", "and the goat walked right to a wild goat", "26:22", "lives out in the fucking woods walked", "26:24", "right up to his daughter and they", "26:26", "laughs and she opened up the bag of", "26:27", "cheetos and put it and he stuffed his", "26:30", "head in the bag of cheetos he knew what",

"and so then we were like like what sets", "39:58", "him apart I mean obviously any Navy SEAL", "40:00", "sniper has got to be amazing but Chris", "40:03", "took it to another level what what was", "40:05", "it and he and he said okay let me show", "40:07", "you what it was so he said as we walked", "40:09", "us over to the window and he goes okay", "40:11", "you see that guy in that hat over there", "40:14", "like about a mile down the you know you", "40:17", "could basically see because of like a", "40:18", "pink hat or something I said yeah he", "40:19", "goes okay if you're a sniper you got to", "40:21", "be able to lay down not move and put", "40:24", "your eye up against this thing and like", "40:26", "look out at him and you can't though if", "40:30", "you ever take your eye off that you're", "40:32", "gonna lose the sight so you got to be", "40:34", "able to stay in that position and I'm", "40:35", "moving to it he goes and I forgot the", "40:37", "number was but Jaco said the average", "40:39", "Navy SEAL sniper can stay in that", "40:41", "position without moving", "40:42", "I glued to the site for X number of", "40:45", "minutes and I forget what the number was", "40:47", "maybe was like 15 minutes", "40:48", "he's like Chris could do that for two", "40:51", "hours he could lay in that position not", "40:54", "moving and not taking his eye off that", "40:57", "thing with one eye shut for hours and he", "41:01", "you know he's just like he just had a", "41:03", "different he just had a different gear", "41:04", "and it was just an amazing I mean I mean", "41:08", "those are some of my favorite moments", "41:09", "with Jaco is when he like can tell you", "41:11", "something that is like like they're like", "41:14", "maybe three people in the world that", "41:15", "would understand why that matters you", "41:17", "know sniping is fat is really", "41:19", "fascinating right because just sharp", "41:22", "shooting just being able to shoot", "41:23", "something at a distance and long", "41:25", "distance shooting is it's it's a big", "41:28", "sport I mean for in terms of target", "41:30", "shooting I mean there's guys that are", "41:32", "out there they're shooting 1,500 yards", "41:34", "and doing it competitively that's a", "41:36", "crazy digit it's amazing it's a crazy", "41:38", "distance but when you think about it you", "41:41", "got a rifle it's on a rest you're", "41:44", "sitting you're either on a bench or", "41:46", "you're prone", "41:47", "whatever it is you're lying down most of", "41:48", "the time this is all it is it's this", "41:51", "with your finger pull pull pull pull", "41:53", "pull boom", "41:54", "some people are way better at that just", "41:57", "think of that coordinating your vision", "42:00", "getting the reticle set on the target", "42:03", "yeah pulling that and without movement", "42:05", "the outliers are the people who can do", "42:08", "that and you've got to think like when", "42:10", "you when you break down physical", "42:11", "movements right like you watching", "42:13", "gymnastics routine the Olympics like", "42:15", "holy shit and it flips and the land and", "42:17", "they stick and it's incredible but now", "42:21", "break it down to just the movement of", "42:23", "your trigger finger pull pull pull pull", "42:25", "pull bang no movement you know I mean", "42:29", "it's", "42:29", "I'm sure you've shot guns but it's hard", "42:32", "to like if you shoot pistols and you", "42:35", "have dummy rounds you know like a lot of", "42:37", "people they mix in dummy round so that", "42:38", "they find out they're jerking the", "42:40", "trigger yeah", "42:41", "and when you see like I was watching a", "42:43", "video with Tim Kennedy and Tim Kennedy", "42:46", "was a shooting at the range and he's", "42:48", "he's pulling bang bang bang and it goes", "42:51", "click and he goes woo look at that", "42:53", "trigger control like it cuz it was he", "42:55", "put the way he pulled it right it didn't", "42:57", "go off target it didn't move it was it", "43:00", "there was no punch to it you know but", "43:01", "you you got a fuckin practice for ever", "43:04", "just to be able to do that just to not", "43:07", "anticipate the recoil of the gun and", "43:09", "yank and move and twitch and just", "43:12", "controlling the mind I mean it's a", "43:14", "fascinating thing to me that's just just", "43:16", "pulling this one finger you would think", "43:18", "fuckin anybody could do that I can show", "43:20", "you how to do that right you know like", "43:22", "like I've had friends that say they want", "43:24", "to go hunting you know I want to go", "43:26", "hunting you know what would I do where", "43:27", "do I get a boat I'm like slow down", "43:29", "let's get your rifle because I could", "43:32", "teach you how to shoot a rifle we could", "43:34", "we could get someone we could sight in", "43:36", "your rifle we'll go to the range I'll", "43:37", "cite it in in a hundred yards get you a", "43:39", "good accurate rifle and then all you", "43:42", "have to do is kind of keep it together a", "43:44", "rifle we get into a hundred yards of a", "43:46", "wild pig you're gonna be able to kill", "43:48", "this thing or 100% you got years before", "43:51", "you're gonna be able to shoot that thing", "43:52", "with a bow I mean fucking years first", "43:55", "what it is and the bow is like my wife", "43:58", "said this to me a while ago she", "44:00", "of all the things you do she's like", "44:03", "archery seems to be the only one where", "44:06", "even if you don't have a good day you're", "44:07", "still happy like if I if I if I'm on the", "44:10", "racetrack and I'm driving a race car or", "44:12", "if I'm you know swimming or whatever and", "44:14", "I just have a bad day like I don't I'm", "44:16", "just not firing on all cylinders like it", "44:18", "you know it just kind of pisses me off", "44:19", "right there's something about archery", "44:21", "where even if I'm not having a good day", "44:23", "like maybe it's an extension of what", "44:26", "you're talking about with the trigger", "44:27", "finger so for me I got an artery because", "44:29", "of Tim and the story that the thing that", "44:32", "he told me which obviously for yeah the", "44:35", "thing that he told me that immediately", "44:36", "made me be like I want to do this it was", "44:39", "just anything that requires that much", "44:41", "perfection just seems great and he was", "44:42", "like yeah you don't take a shot unless", "44:44", "you can kill the animal like you know", "44:46", "and so like you might take one shot in", "44:48", "two days like it's got to be a kill shot", "44:50", "and the kill shots got to look like XY", "44:51", "and Z and I was like oh that's like you", "44:53", "got to be dialed in so it was this idea", "44:57", "of back tension you know it was sort of", "44:59", "like wow if you're taking a perfect shot", "45:01", "like it's all in the rhomboids you know", "45:04", "it's all back here and you've got to be", "45:06", "able to do as you said you've got to", "45:07", "completely be able to eliminate any", "45:10", "anticipation any of this business and", "45:12", "you know and so I think that I I think", "45:16", "of archery for me is almost like a", "45:17", "meditation like if you like I'm talking", "45:19", "in the way like Sam Harris would talk", "45:21", "about sort of consciousness and the way", "45:23", "you are so hyper aware of what you're", "45:25", "doing that yes you can daydream and your", "45:29", "mind can wander but if you actually", "45:30", "start to imagine the sensations of every", "45:33", "part of archery in many ways it feels", "45:35", "like meditating so I think that's why", "45:37", "I'm just like you know and I never", "45:40", "really thought about it with shooting a", "45:41", "rifle so I don't have much experience", "45:43", "with guns but I'm guessing it's it's", "45:46", "very similar but as you said like the", "45:48", "the the difference between the good and", "45:50", "the great and that is less obvious you", "45:53", "know at a distance yeah I think offhand", "45:57", "shooting a rifle and shooting a bow I", "45:59", "bet I bet armed just as accurate at 60", "46:05", "yards as the average person is not a", "46:07", "sniper but the average person with a", "46:09", "rifle you can be pretty fucking accurate", "46:11", "you know you can't", "46:13", "off a bet", "46:13", "so there's there's some similarities", "46:15", "there's like there's a similarity to", "46:18", "having the you have to have perfect", "46:20", "technique you have to have the right", "46:21", "stance you have to make sure that you", "46:23", "know everything's locked in and your", "46:25", "your structure is correct but I agree", "46:29", "with you that I think it's some sort of", "46:30", "a meditation I also think there's", "46:32", "something to hitting a target that is in", "46:36", "our DNA that's connected to hunting", "46:39", "that's connected to survival that's", "46:41", "connected to I mean the thousands of", "46:43", "years that people through arrows and", "46:46", "fucking what did that what does that", "46:48", "thing called what's that thing called", "46:50", "the day yeah as I say it atlatl", "46:53", "right yeah yeah yeah that's like an", "46:57", "advanced spear throwing thing and then", "46:58", "archery and just I think when a person", "47:02", "would hit a deer they knew their tribe", "47:05", "was going to eat right so there's this", "47:07", "like charge and you get a small amount", "47:10", "of that juice when you hit a target yeah", "47:12", "no I'm sure there's I'm if there's got", "47:15", "to be dopamine that's being secreted", "47:16", "whenever we do that it's the greatest", "47:18", "feeling in the world yeah doesn't it it", "47:20", "shouldn't make sense like when you're", "47:21", "looking at someone doing it you're like", "47:23", "what do you give a fuck if that arrow", "47:24", "goes in there it doesn't make a sense", "47:26", "like why does it make somebody there's a", "47:28", "fuckin Sat like Jamie laughs at me", "47:31", "because I'll hit the bull's eye from 45", "47:33", "yards and I'm like yes it's like you get", "47:36", "this little whoa you get a little little", "47:38", "burst man I just like the whole", "47:40", "experience even the sound so sometimes", "47:42", "like when my veins get holes in them", "47:44", "like sometimes you put a broad head", "47:45", "through or you put like a field tip", "47:46", "through another one and now obviously", "47:49", "sometimes if you trash the vein the", "47:50", "arrow doesn't work but like usually just", "47:52", "a single hole in a vein will produce a", "47:54", "sound that is the greatest sound you've", "47:56", "ever heard when that arrow leaves the", "47:58", "whistle yeah yeah love it so the album", "48:02", "with certain broadheads certain vented", "48:04", "broad heads they whistle it was how much", "48:06", "they give the end all the heads yeah", "48:08", "yeah so that whole experience of like", "48:11", "the perfect release you know even when", "48:14", "you surprise yourself like I've been", "48:15", "switched over to this Carter evolution", "48:17", "release sure about back tension release", "48:20", "it's the it's the most pure back tension", "48:21", "it's better than the honey because the", "48:23", "honey you could still cheat a little bit", "48:24", "you know if you were getting lazy you", "48:26", "could you wish list", "48:27", "exactly right the evolution there is no", "48:30", "cheating right you can't you it's yeah", "48:32", "so you can surprise yourself with a shot", "48:35", "mm-hmm yeah so there's no anticipation", "48:37", "yeah yeah you can't explain this to", "48:39", "people who don't do it", "48:40", "notice that now you can't they're like", "48:42", "what are you rambling about boring the", "48:44", "shit out of me I have tried to explain", "48:46", "this to people you don't know what I'm", "48:48", "talking about I was trying to explain it", "48:51", "to Alexander Gustafsson he was in here", "48:52", "the other day and he's a hunter too and", "48:54", "he but he only hunts in Sweden you can't", "48:56", "bow hunt it's not legal oh and he wanted", "48:59", "to learn how to shoot a bow and so I was", "49:01", "explaining that I put my finger on this", "49:03", "trigger my finger sits on the trigger I", "49:05", "use a card or two I use a first choice", "49:07", "that's the name of the reason I go my", "49:09", "finger my thumb is on the trigger but I", "49:10", "never squeeze it yep the squeezing is", "49:13", "all done with my back as I pull then it", "49:15", "got just goes off and look you can see", "49:17", "his head was like why but you just do", "49:20", "that right just do that you know it's so", "49:24", "counterintuitive but once I got into it", "49:28", "Tim actually sent me this book on back", "49:29", "tension and then I just devoured it I", "49:32", "mean it was sort of like the reading the", "49:33", "penny Deen book you know is Tim doing", "49:35", "this a lot now not as much as he should", "49:38", "be but trying to hunt with it yeah Tim", "49:42", "Tim o hunt and I actually got it so far", "49:45", "I know he's hot yeah only with rifles", "49:48", "no no he's hunt he he goes he's been on", "49:50", "bow hunting trips that's in fact what", "49:51", "got me into it cuz about two years ago", "49:53", "he was getting ready to go to a trip do", "49:55", "a five-day trip in Colorado and he", "49:56", "called me and said hey I want to talk", "49:59", "with you about like some training and", "50:01", "some nutrition to like get ready for", "50:02", "this is gonna be kind of an extreme", "50:04", "whole deal you know you're at altitude", "50:06", "you're running around like crazy you got", "50:07", "to be able to like mm-hmm like sprint", "50:10", "and then be totally relaxed and so he's", "50:12", "like you know can you help me think", "50:13", "about how to train and what the", "50:15", "nutrition would be and and I said okay", "50:16", "but tell me more about what the demands", "50:17", "are and the more he told me the more I", "50:20", "was like why am I not doing this", "50:22", "freaking awesome so that's so and he's", "50:26", "got an awesome video of this he took but", "50:30", "I mean probably he only took one shot", "50:33", "and like the whole five-day trip it was", "50:34", "a perfect kill what did he tell", "50:37", "it was a huge bird and I can't even", "50:39", "remember what a word yeah yeah I was",

"57:28", "like the enzymes in the liver that are", "57:30", "responsible for fat oxidation I mean", "57:33", "they just basically become fat burnt I", "57:34", "hate that term fat burning machine

this is a process", "61:30", "they're going through they just think", "61:32", "this is eating and exercise this is what", "61:35", "happens but it's not your body live you", "61:39", "shut up cut that off push it away enter", "61:42", "into", "61:43", "completely different food source just", "61:46", "change the way you you eat your body", "61:49", "will change and that that just that",

box", "62:54", "of cereal so I'd take like one of these", "62:55", "Tupperware bowls it was this big and", "62:57", "fill it with a full box so each day I", "62:58", "would have just a box of cocoa

the thing I want to", "73:33", "know everything about because when I was", "73:36", "a surgical resident you know we used to", "73:37", "give rapamycin out like it was cotton", "73:39", "candy to all

when you do that does that leave", "74:04", "them susceptible to illness or disease", "74:05", "yeah would that be the case with", "74:07", "rapamycin in person taking it for", "74:10", "longevity that's the million-dollar", "74:11", "question and so I think in - so in a", "74:15", "moment I want I'll tell you the story of", "74:16", "how rapamycin came to be because I think", "74:17", "it's the most interesting story in", "74:19", "biology certainly in the last 2530 years", "74:21", "but when it was approved in 1999 by the", "74:25", "FDA it was for this indication it was an", "74:27",

"December of 2014 I feel like it was like", "74:50", "almost Christmas Day I remember thinking", "74:52", "this is like the best present I've ever", "74:53", "got Man X group published this paper", "74:56", "which they did in a group of about 320", "75:01", "65 year olds ish so they put them into", "75:04", "four groups there's a placebo group", "75:06", "there was a group that got and it

they got", "75:25", "nothing for 8 to 12 weeks and then they", "75:26", "were hit with a flu vaccine and then the", "75:29", "scientists measured the immune response", "75:31", "doing these really

group", "75:42", "that got one milligram once a day all", "75:44", "saw an increase in immunity which is a", "75:46", "good thing but the five-and-twenty group", "75:49", "saw an even bigger response the people", "75:51", "who just got 5 once a week or 20 once a", "75:53", "week so on even bigger responds but the", "75:56", "group that took 20 once a week had more", "75:57", "side effects and the

sore no no it's like you canker", "76:19", "so it's a really nasty type of canker", "76:21", "sore yeah so okay once I had one so bad", "76:26", "that I was like this is when I was in", "76:28",

named", "77:18", "William Stewart Halsted who was so near", "77:21", "and dear to my heart because he was the", "77:22", "original he was the founding surgeon at", "77:25", "Johns Hopkins and one of the original", "77:27", "four horsemen so the four main", "77:29", "physicians that basically have shaped", "77:31", "medicine in this country", "77:32", "all started out at Hopkins Osler in", "77:35", "medicine Hopkins in surgery and two", "77:38", "other guys Walsh and I'm blinkin Kelly", "77:40", "was the third one", "77:42", "and he basically figured out because you", "77:45", "got to remember like there was a day", "77:47", "when surgery was staggeringly barbaric", "77:50", "like prior to ether surgery was like", "77:54", "alright can you hold him down like", "77:57", "gagging getting drunk gag them and like", "77:59", "we're gonna do our thing alright yeah", "78:01", "it's just crazy so god I used to know", "78:06", "all of this shit I don't remember any of", "78:07", "the exact dates anymore but it was like", "78:09", "kind of like mid-1800s to late 1800s", "78:13", "when up at Massachusetts General", "78:15", "Hospital I forget the name of who it was", "78:17", "but someone basically came up with ether", "78:19", "so ether became the first form of", "78:21", "anesthetic but you know you were sort of", "78:23", "knocking people out well it was you know", "78:24", "fast forward probably 20-30 years when", "78:27", "Halsted figured out that this thing", "78:29", "called cocaine could provide local", "78:31", "anesthetic so he began experimenting", "78:33", "with like crazy and of course in the", "78:34", "process became like patently addicted to", "78:37", "it so you have this entire generation of", "78:40", "surgeons at Hopkins from that early era", "78:42", "that were completely Koch addicted so", "78:45", "Halsted in all of his first generation", "78:46", "of residents and then of course from", "78:49", "that we got lidocaine bupivacaine all of", "78:53", "these things that don't have the same", "78:54", "properties", "78:55", "but to this day cocaine is still used", "78:58", "and most people don't realize it but", "78:59", "cocaine is a schedule 2 drug meaning it", "79:02", "actually has a medical application", "79:03", "unlike heroin which is Schedule one in", "79:05", "the DEA and marijuana that's right but", "79:08", "but cocaine is schedule 2 and it is", "79:10", "still used in some ENT surgery because", "79:13", "it has some favorable properties over", "79:15", "even lidocaine and bupivacaine for nasal", "79:16", "surgery did you know that they still use", "79:18", "coca leaves for flavor in coca-cola they", "79:21", "actually extract the cocaine from it use", "79:23", "the coca leaves and the cocaine goes to", "79:25", "medical for I don't know", "79:27", "I had cocoa tea for my first time this", "79:30", "summer like real cocoa the latte but", "79:32", "like brought up from Monte Monte to", "79:34", "cocoa that's what it is oh yeah it's", "79:35", "great I could not get enough of that", "79:37", "stuff you can't shut the fuck up on it", "79:39", "though that's it's a weird sort of hi", "79:41", "it's a very strange thing it's very", "79:43", "talkative sort of hi I thought it was", "79:46", "just everything about it was like just", "79:47", "the leaves you ever done that like in", "79:49", "Peru or no no I've never done neither", "79:51", "but apparently it's really interesting", "79:52", "like the it's like a coffee sort of a", "79:55", "thing and it's got flavonoids it's", "79:57", "actually yeah yeah it's actually", "79:59", "probably healthy for you I just love", "80:02", "plants in general yeah but what it's we", "80:04", "think of the coca leaves as producing", "80:07", "cocaine cocaine we think of as", "80:08", "inherently negative but the leaf itself", "80:10", "like if you just don't extract it it's", "80:13", "actually really good well that's the", "80:15", "thing I mean I and that you know even", "80:16", "like thinking about the difference", "80:17", "between eating fruit versus eating Oreos", "80:20", "yeah like yeah like nature is pretty", "80:24", "good at regulating how fast this stuff", "80:27", "so in the case of fruit like how quickly", "80:29", "does fructose hit your liver mm-hmm", "80:31", "there's a sort of governor built into it", "80:33", "if you're putting raspberries like could", "80:35", "you get non-alcoholic fatty liver", "80:37", "disease from eating enough raspberries", "80:38", "yeah probably but it's like you're crazy", "80:40", "yeah you got it you need to become a", "80:42", "full time job or you can just drink a", "80:44", "giant gallon of orange juice every day", "80:46", "all right if that would do it I would do", "80:47", "it yeah cuz we most people think of", "80:50", "fresh-squeezed orange juice as being oh", "80:52", "you're eating healthy yeah look at you", "80:54", "over there were you fresh squeezed are", "80:56", "you juicing as totally healthy super", "80:58", "healthy meanwhile you're just drinking a", "81:00", "big old glass of sugar you literally", "81:02", "your body doesn't know the difference", "81:04", "being down to coca-cola very little", "81:06", "difference between the two well which", "81:08", "Coca Cola's got some other stuff in", "81:09", "there caffeine but other than that yeah", "81:11", "just the sugar itself yeah your liver", "81:13", "would have a hard time telling the", "81:14", "difference so crazy most people would", "81:17", "think a glass of orange juice at", "81:20", "breakfast is a healthy choice now", "81:23", "glasses should have a mountain Dew yeah", "81:26", "might get more shit done so this the", "81:31", "dosage of 1 5 and then 20 so so that", "81:35", "that study I remember reading that and", "81:37", "think", "81:38", "okay if so if you looked at that study", "81:40", "you realize if you're gonna be in the", "81:41", "placebo the one-a-day the five once a", "81:44", "week or the twenty once a week the five", "81:45", "once a week was the way to go", "81:47", "that says you've got sweet spot that's", "81:48", "right you got all the benefit of twenty", "81:50", "more benefit than one and the fewest", "81:52", "side-effects and how long is this study", "81:55", "that was an eight-week intervention with", "81:58", "an eight-week washout was enough to see", "82:00", "the enhanced immunity do you think that", "82:02", "a longer-term study is necessary to see", "82:05", "like whatever body adapts yeah", "82:08", "absolutely I mean all this stuff is in", "82:09", "its infancy now my my schtick is so so", "82:14", "right now rapamycin is off patent right", "82:16", "so the drug was approved in 99 by the", "82:18", "FDA but this is after an unbelievable", "82:21", "amazing story of like how you know this", "82:24", "drug almost got lost forever like you", "82:27", "know so there's no economic incentive", "82:30", "for a company to you know figure out how", "82:33", "to do this thing with rapamycin and even", "82:36", "everolimus I think ultimately Novartis", "82:38", "and I'm saying this with no actual", "82:40", "knowledge other than just my own", "82:41", "speculation but I suspect Novartis was", "82:43", "like well you know we're not gonna play", "82:45", "this game just with everolimus and", "82:47", "that's I think why it probably spun into", "82:49", "this other company restore bio to sort", "82:52", "of combine it with other agents but at", "82:57", "an end of one level what I'm kind of", "82:59", "interested in doing is you know using", "83:02", "myself as a guinea pig to start to", "83:04", "measure the benefits of it because my", "83:07", "hypothesis is three things have to be", "83:09", "true if rapamycin is working now I could", "83:12", "be wrong but but this is my hypothesis", "83:15", "and this is what I test with with with", "83:16", "with other scientists is if you were", "83:19", "taking rapamycin at the right dose so", "83:22", "assume you're not getting all the nasty", "83:24", "side effects you're not getting the", "83:25", "mouth sores and stuff like that three", "83:26", "things have to get better one your", "83:28", "glucose metabolism should at least get", "83:31", "no worse but potentially better I", "83:33", "suspect it's a function of where you", "83:34", "start so there is one doctor in New York", "83:38", "who has like a rapamycin practice I", "83:40", "think he's in he's in the Bronx actually", "83:43", "and I've talked to him a bunch and when", "83:46", "he", "83:49", "when he started it himself he said like", "83:51", "the improvements were remarkable just in", "83:53", "terms of glucose metabolism but I think", "83:55", "he was starting at a pretty bad spot but", "83:56", "if you or I took it", "83:58", "we might not notice much getting better", "84:00", "but we definitely should not get worse", "84:02", "so that's easy to measure clinically you", "84:04", "do as an oral glucose tolerance test", "84:05", "would give you that answer but two", "84:07", "things should get significantly better", "84:10", "the first is immune function should get", "84:12", "better not worse", "84:13", "there is no clinical way to measure that", "84:15", "but we do know how to measure it I mean", "84:18", "when I was doing my postdoc it was in an", "84:20", "immunology lab like I know how to do", "84:22", "that assay I just don't have like a", "84:24", "million dollars worth of equipment to", "84:25", "measure it what is the difference in the", "84:27", "dosage even in the high end at 20 versus", "84:30", "which would give someone if they got a", "84:31", "kidney transplant yeah yeah typical", "84:34", "transplant dose would have been like 2 3", "84:36", "milligrams every day okay so it's quite", "84:39", "a bit different it is and it's different", "84:41", "on two levels because you know

little bit but", "85:07", "going back to this rapamycin thing the", "85:09", "third thing that has to be true in my", "85:11", "opinion I could be full of shit but I", "85:13", "think the third thing that has to be", "85:14", "true if you're taking the right dose is", "85:16", "you need to see an uptick in a toff adji", "85:18", "and so just as if what does that mean at", "85:22", "Apogee is this process where the body", "85:23", "cells start eating themselves so it's", "85:26", "kind of like a programmed cell death", "85:28", "although technically we reserved that", "85:30", "term for something called apoptosis but", "85:32", "when you're fasting what's why would", "85:35", "fasting produce a benefit and I think", "85:37", "the most logical explanation is enhanced", "85:40", "etaf

actually was", "86:26", "2016 so it's very recent bout a year and", "86:28", "a half ago this is what the Nobel Prize", "86:29", "was awarded for but what I'm hoping is", "86:32", "that we can develop a signature for a", "86:34", "toughie G with a blood test so I believe", "86:37", "that you should be able to look at", "86:39", "someone's blood and look at all of the", "86:42", "you know

know fasted or bred it's", "86:53", "already fully fed otherwise would you", "86:55", "just take a sample of the muscle tissue", "86:57", "like punch something out yeah and and", "86:59", "I'm I mean I'm willing to do it all and", "87:01", "I probably will we're just trying to get", "87:03", "what's called an IRB an institutional", "87:05", "review board so to do these kinds of", "87:06", "studies in humans even if I'm the only", "87:08", "subject and it's just like I don't care", "87:11", "what you do to me kind of thing we still", "87:12", "have to get an IRB so we're working on", "87:14",

probably", "87:33", "have to talk to people who have a lot of", "87:34", "experience doing this with animals but", "87:36", "it it actually wouldn't surprise me like", "87:38", "if I were gonna do it I would just start", "87:40", "in the legs because the muscles in the", "87:42", "legs tend to be the harbinger of what's", "87:45", "going on in the body so for example one", "87:47", "of the first signs of diabetes like a", "87:49", "decade before you get diabetes one thing", "87:51", "that if you're actually doing this kind", "87:53", "of testing in people it you'll notice", "87:55", "glucose like insulin resistance and the", "87:58", "muscles of the legs hmm so once the legs", "88:00", "start to get insulin resistant you're on", "88:02", "a glide path to bad things happening I'm", "88:05", "fascinated by legs first of all from", "88:08", "years of martial arts but also because", "88:10", "over the last year so I've been doing a", "88:12", "lot of running and it's one of the only", "88:15", "muscle groups that I", "88:16", "to work out everyday I can I can run", "88:19", "hills everyday and I'm not sore like", "88:23", "that that's not even possible", "88:25", "for any other group I mean I can kind of", "88:28", "do that with boxing you can hit the bag", "88:30", "and but as far as like running hills is", "88:33", "essentially like plyometrics like you're", "88:35",

"88:43", "fucking arms will fall off I mean", "88:45", "there's probably someone out there doing", "88:47", "it that's proving me wrong but there's", "88:48", "nothing like the amount of endurance", "88:50", "that you have in your life but it could", "88:51", "just be an adaptation that you've had as", "88:53", "well I mean when I was a competitive", "88:55", "cyclist I mean there were definitely", "88:59", "days when I would especially when we did", "89:00", "like multi-day events like there were", "89:03", "days when it's just like you're beaten", "89:06", "down yeah you're gonna learn in the", "89:08", "first ten minutes like everybody else is", "89:10", "riding together you're riding alone the", "89:12", "fatigue level though is significantly", "89:15", "different than it different than it", "89:16", "would be if you were doing something", "89:17", "with your arms every day you can", "89:20", "definitely recruit more that's probably", "89:21", "part of it right it's like more tissue I", "89:23", "think you have more options like you can", "89:25", "you know especially if you really have", "89:26", "good proprioception but for example like", "89:29", "if you're dead lifting you know I", "89:31", "actually think if you so you know how", "89:35", "you have like the positive and negative", "89:36", "motion concentric eccentric motion of a", "89:38", "weight if you're willing to do away with", "89:41", "the negative you can lift heavy every", "89:45", "single day so there's this guy named", "89:46", "Riley Oh un-freakin'-believable dude", "89:49", "I've seen people doing that you know I", "89:51", "saw their Eagle Val on his Instagram the", "89:54", "other day was doing deadlifts and just", "89:55", "dropping the weight and I was like that", "89:57", "seems weird to me so when I was a", "89:58", "cyclist this was my training and it was", "90:01", "all put together by this guy named Ryan", "90:02", "Flaherty who actually introduced that", "90:04", "was another one of my sight unseen", "90:05", "introductions to Tim for a podcast it's", "90:07", "a great podcast with Ryan Flaherty on", "90:09", "and he's I call him the Guru of speed he", "90:13", "this is a guy who like single-handedly I", "90:15", "shouldn't say single-handedly I mean", "90:16", "he's on the shoulders of many other", "90:18", "people who have done great work but but", "90:20", "has really done an amazing job of", "90:22", "figuring out how to make people run fast", "90:24", "and it's a very long story and I mean he", "90:28", "does such a great job on the podcast", "90:30", "go into it but but for the purpose of", "90:31", "this discussion one of our interests was", "90:34", "hey could we translate everything you've", "90:36", "learned about sprinting into cycling and", "90:39", "his biggest observation was the", "90:41", "following if he took a hundred runners", "90:43", "and lined him up and knew like before", "90:46", "they ran knew how how hard they could", "90:49", "hit a force plate treadmill he could", "90:51", "predict the order in which they'd finish", "90:53", "the race so a force plate treadmill as", "90:55", "its name suggests a treadmill but it's a", "90:57", "special treadmill where it measures the", "90:58", "force that you hit and that the higher", "91:02", "that number divided by your body weight", "91:04", "that became what he described as mass", "91:06", "specific force that number if you rank", "91:09", "order it is the order in which people", "91:11", "would finish the run so it kind of makes", "91:14", "sense if you think about it right the", "91:16", "harder you can hit the ground relative", "91:17", "to your own weight the higher you go and", "91:19", "the higher you go the longer you travel", "91:21", "with each stride so Usain Bolt has the", "91:23", "highest ever force plate measurement", "91:28", "calculation and it's I forget what his", "91:31", "ratio is I want to say he's like 6.9 or", "91:35", "seven times more force than his", "91:38", "bodyweight every time he hits you", "91:40", "freaking staggering Wow", "91:42", "so then Ryan's once he figured all this", "91:44", "stuff out his next question this is when", "91:46", "he was working at USA track his next", "91:47", "question was could you train this in", "91:49", "other words like okay if Joe runs a you", "91:52", "know 4.9 40 and we want to get that down", "91:55", "to a four five can that be done and it", "91:59", "turned out the answer was categorically", "92:01", "yes you have to do two things you have", "92:03", "to get stronger and you have to get", "92:05", "lighter so how do you do that and that's", "92:07", "when he came up with this idea of we do", "92:09", "hex bar deadlifts we lift really heavy", "92:12", "so you're only doing 5s for is 3s or", "92:14", "twos never more than five reps and so", "92:17", "you'll do five sets every single day and", "92:19", "you'll pick it so some days it'll be", "92:21", "five sets of three some days it's five", "92:23", "sets of five whatever it is and you're", "92:25", "and they're very well prescribed like", "92:27", "you know at what percentage of your one", "92:29", "rep max you're doing these at in its up", "92:32", "drop up drop up drop so you're never", "92:35", "getting the actin myosin filament to", "92:38", "tear past because that's what's", "92:39", "happening in the negative is the actin", "92:41", "and the the actin is coming", "92:43", "de myosin and that is creating a micro", "92:46", "tear in the muscle and that's what the", "92:47", "muscle rebuilt that's why we get larger", "92:49", "when we lift weights but when you drop", "92:51", "it you you unload the muscle when you're", "92:54", "relaxing it so the muscles not going to", "92:56", "get bigger so you're getting all the", "92:58", "benefits all the strength which is", "92:59", "primarily around the type 2b muscle", "93:01", "fiber and without the without the size", "93:06", "so anyway went well when I asked Ryan", "93:08", "hey could we do this in cycling we did", "93:09", "this experiment which was he kind of", "93:11", "came up this was for me and two other", "93:13", "guys who were very good cyclists like I", "93:15", "was like I'm a popper but these guys", "93:16", "were like cat1 cat2 collegiate cyclers", "93:19", "but but cyclists but they were like my", "93:21", "training partners so we did this thing", "93:24", "where we did the same routine that he", "93:25", "had the sprinters doing and it's a bit", "93:27", "more complicated than I've described", "93:28", "because you're also juxtaposing the", "93:31", "positive-only with something called a", "93:33", "post activation potentiation which you", "93:35", "may have already experienced this but I", "93:37", "don't have you've ever tried to do", "93:38", "plyometrics after deadlifting but it", "93:41", "seems counterintuitive that you'd be", "93:42", "able to do more but you can really yeah", "93:45", "it has to be a heavy deadlifts of", "93:47", "numbers or in terms of distance like", "93:50", "more in terms of vertical really so your", "93:52", "highest like plyometric jump is going to", "93:56", "come after you've done like you know", "93:58", "three sets of three at you know ninety", "94:01", "five percent of your one rep max and", "94:03", "three sets of three dropping or using", "94:05", "eccentric no definitely no eccentric", "94:07", "absolutely yeah huh Wow and so we would", "94:09", "superset the plyometrics with the", "94:11", "deadlifts and you would do this every", "94:13", "day and so Ryan you know here he runs a", "94:17", "training camp where he has typically the", "94:21", "top ten college prospects every year", "94:22", "just before the NFL Combine come down", "94:24", "and I mean the changes he makes in their", "94:28", "time like Johnny Manziel was one of them", "94:29", "so obviously Johnny Manziel has", "94:30", "obviously you know not panned out in the", "94:32", "pros but most people kind of forget how", "94:34", "good an athlete he was and when he", "94:36", "showed up to camp I forget what his time", "94:39", "was but I want to say it was about I", "94:41", "don't you could probably look at this", "94:43", "stuff for me you know it was three", "94:46", "tenths slower than what he ultimately", "94:48", "ran at the combine and he I think he had", "94:50", "the fastest or second fastest", "94:52", "quarterback time at the combine after", "94:54", "just 12 weeks of doing this Wow I mean", "94:56", "it was unbelievable", "94:57", "lievable how fast he can get these guys", "94:59", "to run i saw something the other day", "95:01", "that I'd never seen before it's an", "95:03", "eccentric bike it changes back and forth", "95:06", "heard of this thing the second person", "95:08", "that tell me about this I think I saw it", "95:10", "yesterday in fact now that I think about", "95:12", "it it was eccentric and concentric but", "95:14", "it alternates yeah yeah and it looked", "95:18", "really weird", "95:18", "it forces movement and you're resisting", "95:21", "the movement see if you can find that", "95:23", "Jamie it's like an eccentric I forget", "95:25", "what it's called but uh like someone", "95:28", "sent me this like hey this thing's", "95:29", "amazing I was like its bike the fuck you", "95:31", "talking about look different than that", "95:33", "the one I saw was also different look it", "95:35", "was a Rick that's like a recumbent yeah", "95:37", "yeah that's what I saw - yeah", "95:40", "eccentric yeah you're spelling it wrong", "95:43", "oh it says just centric okay huh", "95:48", "eccentric exercise bike try that but", "95:53", "it's the thing is it alternated between", "95:56", "eccentric and concentric it wasn't just", "95:58", "hmm", "95:59", "the one with the red and the top row", "96:01", "looks like it what is that Pediatric", "96:04", "Trauma no kids well whatever I wish I", "96:11", "had saved it because I was like I'm", "96:13", "never buying this but you know it just", "96:15", "looked interesting it's like there's", "96:17", "always these new methods of stimulating", "96:19", "the body and tricking it into doing", "96:21", "things and I guess that's essentially", "96:24", "what a lot of people the way a lot of", "96:25", "people think of intermittent fasting", "96:26", "you're kind of stimulating the body", "96:28", "you're hacking it you're tricking it you", "96:30", "know and I wonder you know one of the", "96:32", "things that Ryan and I talked about was", "96:33", "could we ever adopt his training system", "96:36", "to swimming hmm and in running and", "96:40", "cycling it's primarily gonna be quads", "96:42", "hams glutes have to be the muscles that", "96:44", "do it which any row things we were", "96:47", "talking about like you really got to be", "96:49", "able to get the lats fired but how do", "96:50", "you get the lats to fire at such a", "96:52", "weight and then without having to do the", "96:55", "negative as well so we just couldn't", "96:57", "really kind of figure out how to do it", "96:59", "and and there so we adapted part of his", "97:02", "technique to swimming which was the", "97:03", "actual training routine meaning so one", "97:07", "of the big misconceptions if you're", "97:08", "trying to go fast", "97:09", "is that you need to still train slow but", "97:12", "the reality of it is like you know if", "97:14", "you're trying to run a marathon at you", "97:19", "know call it a pace of 215 you know", "97:22", "world-class marathon runner there's not", "97:24", "a lot of benefit to be spending much", "97:26", "time running at a pace slower than that", "97:28", "if anything you want to be running", "97:29", "slightly faster that's you know whom", "97:30", "ebiz the American marathoner who won the", "97:32", "Boston Marathon three years ago no so", "97:35", "amazing marathoner", "97:36", "he's the I think he's the only person to", "97:40", "have won the New York Marathon the", "97:42", "Boston Marathon and to have won an", "97:44", "Olympic medal in marathon he won a", "97:45", "silver medal in the 2004 Athens Games", "97:48", "but when he won the Boston Marathon", "97:51", "he was like 38 years old which in", "97:53", "marathon parlance is like he might as", "97:55", "well be a hundred and he had not really", "97:57", "had a great race in the previous few", "97:59", "years so he had been effectively written", "98:01", "off in the sport and Ryan actually", "98:03", "helped train him and all they did was", "98:06", "apply this principle of sprinting into", "98:08", "marathon running which was all right", "98:10", "Matt if you want to win the Boston", "98:11", "Marathon you need to be able to travel", "98:13", "like four inches further with every step", "98:16", "you take taking the same number of steps", "98:18", "at the same cadence that you currently", "98:19", "run and they you know Ryan did the math", "98:22", "and said that means your force number", "98:25", "has to go from where it is now which I", "98:27", "think was one point seven meaning he", "98:28", "could only deadlift one point seven", "98:30", "times his body weight you have to get", "98:32", "that up to like two point six or", "98:33", "something", "98:33", "and so when meb trained for the boston", "98:35", "marathon he was focusing heavily on", "98:39", "these deadlifts and doing much shorter", "98:41", "faster runs and you know I mean if you", "98:44", "watch the video of his boston marathon", "98:46", "when it's incredible like you know he", "98:49", "just takes off and like leaves everybody", "98:52", "behind him and they're like yeah there's", "98:53", "no way he'll be able to keep that up", "98:54", "will let him go and they couldn't rein", "98:56", "him in Wow", "98:58", "do you think that someone's gonna be", "99:00", "able to break two but that's the big we", "99:02", "were just talking about the other day", "99:03", "some guy got really closed would you say", "99:04", "he hit Jamie like 206 or something I", "99:06", "think someone's gone closer to that", "99:08", "giant didn't that guy in Germany last", "99:09", "year go even closer I think it was 202", "99:12", "or something along those lines and you", "99:14", "think that this sort of method is what", "99:16", "they're using so I don't know if I'm", "99:18", "allowed to talk specifically", "99:22", "don't worry no one's listening so so", "99:27", "short answer is yes I think this can be", "99:29", "done everything has to be perfect", "99:32", "right meaning you have to have the", "99:34", "perfect athlete trained to peak at the", "99:38", "right time you need the right humidity", "99:40", "like everything has to fire on all", "99:41", "cylinders but just as there was nothing", "99:45", "physiologically special about a", "99:47", "four-minute mile when roger bannister", "99:48", "broke it it was more of a psychological", "99:50", "barrier you know I'm not suggesting for", "99:54", "a moment that this will be easy", "99:55", "but you know we're gonna get there I", "99:58", "mean like this can happen that is", "100:00", "incredible if you think about how fast", "100:02", "you're running to run 26 miles in two", "100:05", "hours is staggering I don't think people", "100:07", "understand like what uh I mean I was", "100:11", "never a great runner I could I was about", "100:13", "a 250 marathon 255 marathon when I was a", "100:17", "boxer but never trained as a runner like", "100:19", "it was just I just ran so much and I was", "100:21", "pretty fast but like when I think about", "100:24", "how hard I would have to run to bust out", "100:27", "a 250 to 255 and to think like was there", "100:31", "any chance I could have ever got that", "100:32", "down to a 230 it's a that is such an", "100:38", "enormous change in pace yeah it's it's I", "100:41", "I don't know that I ever could have done", "100:43", "that regardless of all the training", "100:44", "tricks in the world and what kind of", "100:45", "diet of those guys following well I know", "100:49", "med personally I can't speak to what the", "100:51", "other guys do but I think a lot of those", "100:52", "guys are frankly in the state of where I", "100:55", "was when they were younger meaning like", "100:57", "I they can probably get away with a lot", "100:59", "more if you look at the physics of most", "101:02", "of these guys they're they're perfectly", "101:05", "built like I'm talking elite level I'm", "101:07", "not talking about like anyone who go", "101:08", "runs a marathon but if you're talking", "101:09", "about like the people who are gonna win", "101:10", "the marathons they are basically all", "101:13", "engine and then chassis in the right", "101:16", "place that's basically all they come", "101:17", "down to right I mean they are enormous", "101:20", "cardiovascular system very

well I mean it's all", "101:31", "relative but when you look at their", "101:33", "frame there", "101:34", "thorax is gonna be larger and is it", "101:36", "expanded because of the training I think", "101:38", "so I mean it's you never know cause and", "101:41", "effect sometimes you could argue Mike", "101:42", "maybe these guys were maybe the people", "101:45", "who are drawn to those sports are the", "101:47", "ones that are you know or are drawn to", "101:49", "be elite in those sports already had a", "101:51", "genetic predisposition that's sort of my", "101:53", "feeling is it's another difference with", "101:54", "Lance Armstrong like doesn't he have a", "101:56", "very large heart I don't know I think", "102:00", "what Lance had that was pretty unique", "102:03", "even amongst the world's best which is", "102:06", "what he competed with of course I think", "102:08", "his lactate threshold was a lot higher", "102:11", "than most people", "102:12", "genetically yeah and then of course in a", "102:15", "in again you know I mean I know it's", "102:16", "such a controversial topic although my", "102:18", "view is I think that every single", "102:21", "cyclist at least from 1991 until 2011", "102:24", "was on highly highly you know augmented", "102:28", "programs so you know that Lance won", "102:31", "seven of those years in the in that", "102:35", "context just tells me that he was you", "102:37", "know training harder and being more", "102:39", "specific to the race I mean what people", "102:41", "don't understand is like I mean Lance", "102:43", "only peaked for one race a year like", "102:45", "everything that that team US Postal did", "102:47", "was geared for that one race and also", "102:52", "when you really look at how much doping", "102:54", "they did it well she wasn't that much", "102:55", "like you know when they were blood", "102:58", "transfusing it might have been two units", "103:00", "over the course of a race and I'm not", "103:01",

"so Lance won I think his first one in 99", "103:12", "the guy who won before that in 98 was", "103:15", "Marco Pantani before that was again in", "103:17", "beyond ORAC in 97 and before that was",

"103:49", "about him beyond like the little bits", "103:50", "that I have read over time but I do", "103:52", "think his lactate tolerance was", "103:54", "remarkable meaning you know we measure", "103:57", "lactate in athletes swimmers and", "103:59", "cyclists when they're you know trying to", "104:01", "figure out what their performance is and", "104:02", "as far as I can tell there are seem to", "104:04", "be these two phenotypes there's the one", "104:06", "phenotype where people can tolerate", "104:08", "staggeringly high amounts of lactate and", "104:10", "and again it's not lactate per se that", "104:12", "is causing the pain that you're", "104:14", "experiencing it's the hydrogen ion that", "104:16", "accompanies the lactate so lactic acid", "104:20", "the acid part of that is the hydrogen", "104:22", "ion and that's actually what's poisoning", "104:24", "the muscle and preventing the muscle", "104:26", "from having this effortless actin-myosin", "104:29", "act you know contract release etcetera", "104:32", "but we use lactate as a proxy because", "104:34", "where lactate is high the hydrogen ion", "104:36", "is high and there are some people who", "104:37", "can just tolerate like incredible doses", "104:40", "I used to work with Olympic swimmers and", "104:42", "I mean there were just a couple of these", "104:45", "guys like they could actually be",

like I", "104:57", "was on the floor if I was over 17 I was", "104:59", "puking and and I saw dudes that could", "105:02", "stand there at 24 in fact I one of my", "105:05", "good friends he won a gold and a silver", "105:08", "medal in the Sydney Olympics and retired", "105:11", "from swimming in 2004 then came back to", "105:13", "swim masters so and was like he actually", "105:16", "was trying to make a comeback to make", "105:18", "the 2012 Olympic team and when he was", "105:20", "training for that like I would poke him", "105:21", "between races and I saw him get out of a", "105:24", "400 into the individual medley race", "105:25", "which is the hardest swim race of them", "105:27", "all the 400 IM is i mean you might as", "105:30", "well just shoot yourself it's so painful", "105:31", "he got out of that had a lactate of", "105:33", "eighteen two minutes later not two", "105:37", "minutes later maybe seven mins later", "105:38", "jumped on the blocks and won a hundred", "105:39", "breast race you know came out with a", "105:41", "lactate of 21 that kind of thing so", "105:43", "there are those guys and then I think at", "105:45", "the other end of the spectrum the word", "105:48", "on the street is guys like Michael", "105:49", "Phelps or at the opposite end of that", "105:50", "where they are so efficient at shuttling", "105:55", "lactic acid out of the cell back to the", "105:57", "liver where this thing called the Cori", "105:59", "cycle actually", "106:00", "terns lactate back into glucose that", "106:03", "they never have high levels of lactate", "106:04", "now again all of this is sort of work", "106:06", "you know speculation because I don't I", "106:08", "think they were very hush-hush about", "106:09", "Phelps's numbers but I heard from", "106:11", "reliable and reasonable sources that he", "106:13", "would rarely have a lactate above eight", "106:15", "point zero including when he's breaking", "106:17", "World Records whoa which for me at eight", "106:20", "point zero like I'm smoking and joking", "106:21", "like that's fine but for you know he was", "106:24", "so efficient at getting rid of it that", "106:27", "yeah he could you know set the world", "106:29", "record in the 400 I am and have a", "106:30", "lactate of eight again I don't know if", "106:32", "this is true but but I've there's", "106:35", "certainly a plausible mechanism by which", "106:37", "it could be well it's fascinating that", "106:39", "this could potentially all be engineered", "106:41", "right that like through use of CRISPR or", "106:43", "something else you could take all these", "106:45", "various facets of performance enhancing", "106:48", "modalities extend a person's ability in", "106:52", "so many different ways and create a", "106:53", "super person yeah of course it's", "106:55", "interesting right once you start", "106:56", "genetically doing it but does it become", "106:59", "cheating in the same way like would we", "107:00", "would we does it if you have someone", "107:02", "like Phelps who has this genetic", "107:04", "predisposition to getting rid of lactose", "107:06", "lactate and you take someone like me", "107:09", "probably has none of that and you know", "107:11", "you juice me up to his level is that", "107:14", "cheating I mean I don't know I mean", "107:17", "those are the questions I mean this is", "107:18", "why people like Daniel Coyle who are so", "107:20", "critical of Lance Armstrong say because", "107:22", "because on the one hand you'll have", "107:24", "camps that say look it's the great", "107:25", "equalizer like why don't we just let", "107:27", "everybody dopes and it's a steroid", "107:29", "argument with them amazed well well and", "107:31", "and frankly it's more my argument but I", "107:33", "have a different reason for arguing that", "107:34", "way which is I think having done these", "107:37", "sports and nowhere near at the high", "107:38", "level that those guys do it I just know", "107:40", "how destructive they are like the Tour", "107:42", "de France is the most unhealthy thing on", "107:44", "the face of the earth I've heard that", "107:45", "it's healthier to do two Tour de France", "107:48", "on steroids", "107:49", "than it is to do it off sterile", "107:51", "abso-fucking-lutely", "107:52", "[Music]", "107:53", "when those guys finish the Tour de", "107:55", "France they are osteopenic I mean their", "107:57", "bone density has eroded their muscle", "107:59", "they have lost so much muscle mass I", "108:01", "mean it is a devastating grueling event", "108:03", "now nothing's going to completely", "108:05", "ameliorate that but like if we think", "108:08", "that like watching these guys kill", "108:10", "themselves riding six hours a day", "108:13", "hitting peak thresholds of you know six", "108:16", "watts per kilogram if we think there's", "108:18", "anything physiologically reasonable", "108:19", "about that we're out to fucking lunch", "108:21", "but is that the point I mean isn't that", "108:23", "the point is that you can push your mind", "108:25", "to do something your body absolutely", "108:27", "doesn't want to do so you should be", "108:29", "rewarded for for that you know you and", "108:32", "and these guys are in a league of their", "108:33", "own I mean professional cyclists are", "108:34", "some of the toughest athletes out there", "108:36", "I mean obviously every athlete at the", "108:37", "peak of their game is remarkable and and", "108:39", "no disrespect to like the best running", "108:41", "back in the NFL but like you can't even", "108:44", "compare that to what a guy does for", "108:46", "workload for sure yeah for just the pain", "108:49", "like the absolute sheer discomfort and", "108:52", "the physiologic torture and the duration", "108:54", "of it and all these other things well", "108:56", "you see it in their faces too those guys", "108:57", "like when they retired they look like", "108:59", "they're 10 years older than they are", "109:00", "yeah yeah yeah", "109:01", "I mean they've lost all of the fat a lot", "109:03", "of them you know they just if you don't", "109:05", "have fat in your face I mean you age", "109:06", "yeah matically they just look exhausted", "109:09", "too I mean it looks like it's just", "109:11", "drained them like they've forced to live", "109:13", "30 years inside of ten yeah so it's like", "109:16", "what if we just say guess what", "109:17", "everybody's allowed to use whatever", "109:19", "amounts of EPO blood testosterone to be", "109:22", "at the 80th percentile of what we", "109:24", "consider normal", "109:25", "so everybody's allowed to walk around", "109:26", "with a hemoglobin of 14.7 or up to 14.7", "109:31", "or 50 would cheat that right wouldn't", "109:33", "they I mean if you allow people to use", "109:36", "but but I also think like the the", "109:38", "testing on this stuff is so like it's so", "109:42", "JV now there was this idea called the", "109:44", "biological passport that was introduced", "109:45", "many years ago which basically said look", "109:47", "we're gonna develop a signature for", "109:49", "every person and now if you deviate much", "109:51", "from your signature we'll that'll be the", "109:53", "trigger", "109:54", "and the argument again by certain people", "109:56", "I think Daniel Coyle argued this a lot", "109:58", "in one of his books that he wrote", "110:01", "ripping apart lance was the reason it's", "110:04", "that the reason doping is unfair because", "110:07", "the everybody does that argument doesn't", "110:08", "hold water is because if you're a person", "110:11", "who naturally lives at a hematocrit of", "110:13", "47 you're only getting a slight", "110:16", "improvement going from 47 to 50 if", "110:19", "you're a person who naturally lives at", "110:20", "43 you going from 43 to 50 you get a", "110:23", "much bigger advance", "110:25", "to which I say yeah but that's true on a", "110:29", "relative basis but an absolute level if", "110:32", "everybody's walking around with a", "110:33", "hematocrit of 48 to 50 they still have", "110:36", "the same oxygen carrying capacity it", "110:38", "does level the playing field the concern", "110:40", "though isn't oh I would believe the", "110:42", "concern is you don't want people to", "110:45", "think that the only way to do this sport", "110:46", "is to take drugs well absolutely and", "110:49", "it's also worth putting in in mind that", "110:52", "and this is sort of my pet peeve with", "110:53", "this whole drug and sport thing is like", "110:55", "I mean personally I don't really give a", "110:59", "shit I mean I just have bigger things I", "111:01", "care about then like how many steroids", "111:03", "Barry Bonds took to hit all those home", "111:05", "runs but what really does chapped my ass", "111:07", "is when people don't actually understand", "111:08", "how steroids work right like it bugs the", "111:11", "shit out of me when people assume that", "111:13", "if you take steroids you will have you", "111:16", "know you will hit that many you know", "111:17", "homeruns or you will run this fast or", "111:20", "lift this much the only thing that", "111:22", "steroid is doing is enabling you to", "111:23", "recover faster from the brutal work that", "111:26", "it takes to actually do those things so", "111:29", "you know all the eat if I if I shot", "111:33", "myself full of EPO", "111:34", "I mean you've probably seen Icarus right", "111:36", "mm-hmm I mean I thought that was I", "111:37", "thought he did it I thought but Brian", "111:39", "I'm folk yeah I thought prideful did a", "111:41", "really good job of showing like I mean", "111:43", "and he was a pretty good responder to", "111:45", "the EPO I think he did growth hormone", "111:47", "testosterone an EPO I mean you saw in", "111:50", "the end of the day he finished worse the", "111:53", "second year round because but his bike", "111:55", "ran out exactly that's my point you see", "111:57", "like people don't realize like one", "111:59", "little thing makes all the difference", "112:01", "from a performance standpoint yeah he", "112:03", "probably would have done a little bit", "112:04", "better but it's not because the drugs", "112:07", "were in him per se it's because the", "112:08", "drugs that were in him allowed to train", "112:10", "more so the reason he was a fitter Rider", "112:12", "the second year was because his watts", "112:16", "per kilo were hired because of how much", "112:17", "more he trained the drugs enabled him to", "112:20", "train that much harder yeah that's what", "112:22", "it does it allows you to train harder so", "112:23", "you recover better so you have more", "112:25", "output correct but we don't want young", "112:28", "kids to think that the only way to do", "112:29", "this is start taking steroids and fuck", "112:31", "up your endocrine system and that's no", "112:33", "of course not but we also want to keep", "112:34", "in mind like see it almost requires like", "112:37", "a broader discussion", "112:38", "which is like why do we care well we", "112:41", "care in combat sports because it allows", "112:42", "you to inflict more damage oh no no no", "112:44", "I'm saying like why would why do why it", "112:47", "let's just say I'm not a professional", "112:48", "athlete okay why do I actually care how", "112:51", "fast I run or how fast I ride or any of", "112:54", "these other things well because you want", "112:56", "to brag about it okay so maybe your", "112:58", "weight right so maybe therein lies the", "113:00", "problem I mean I mean I you know when I", "113:03", "stopped cycling competitively I think a", "113:07", "big part of it was I just realized that", "113:10", "performance and longevity stopped being", "113:14", "collinear they started to become", "113:15", "somewhat orthogonal they started to", "113:17", "deviate in other words the things that I", "113:19", "was doing that were enhancing my", "113:20", "performance and I'm not even talking", "113:22", "about drugs I'm just talking training", "113:24", "wise it seemed to come at the expense of", "113:27", "what I believed was gonna make me live", "113:28", "longer so specifically the the thing I", "113:31", "cared most about was cardiovascular", "113:33", "health now the incidence of atrial", "113:35", "fibrillation in highly trained athletes", "113:39", "is ten times higher than that of non", "113:41", "athletes so like that's a little", "113:44", "counterintuitive right yeah why would", "113:46", "people who have such amazingly fit", "113:48", "cardiovascular systems have ten times", "113:50", "the risk of this horrible condition", "113:53", "called atrial fibrillation which yeah", "113:55", "many people have it but not young you're", "113:57", "not supposed to have that when you're 40", "113:58", "and it's usually associated with", "114:00", "cardiovascular disease and yet people", "114:04", "are you know showing up with these I", "114:06", "mean I have four patients who have had", "114:08", "to get ablations for atrial fibrillation", "114:10", "what is an ablation an ablation is a", "114:12", "procedure where they stick a catheter up", "114:14", "through the femoral artery or in the", "114:15", "vein and then they burn pieces of the", "114:18", "heart specifically around the pulmonary", "114:23", "veins and they basically are trying to", "114:26", "burn away and create or remove the", "114:31", "ability of the electrical system to move", "114:33", "in this way so it was basically", "114:34", "happening with with this type of", "114:36", "athletes heart is when your heart is", "114:39", "constantly being exposed to that high", "114:40", "stretch high ejection fraction load", "114:42", "you're basically stretching out the", "114:44", "electrical system because the electrical", "114:45", "system of the heart runs within its", "114:46", "muscles so as you stretch it out a", "114:48", "certain group of people and we don't", "114:51", "know why certain people are", "114:52", "no uncertain or not but they just", "114:54", "developed this this dysrhythmia so", "114:57", "you're soldering the motherboard as it", "114:59", "were yeah yeah you can effectively think", "115:00", "of that right you're like creating new", "115:02", "like lines to block the the connection", "115:05", "whoa that's fucking crazy yes think", "115:09", "about it someone said once and I don't", "115:10", "know if it's true maybe you would be", "115:12", "able to have some insight there that", "115:15", "there's a concept that your entire life", "115:18", "you have a certain amount of heartbeats", "115:21", "does that make sense", "115:23", "oh no of course I've heard it many times", "115:24", "I don't know if that's correct that's", "115:27", "fucking scary yeah I don't I don't I", "115:29", "don't tend to agree with that because I", "115:33", "you can't compare one beat to the other", "115:35", "I mean you you can't you know it's hard", "115:37", "for me to say that you know an 80 to 90%", "115:40", "ejection fraction beat under incredible", "115:44", "load is the same as the beat that I'm", "115:46", "you know like it is beat per beat the", "115:48", "same as the beat I experience when I'm", "115:49", "sleeping and my heart's rating you know", "115:51", "my hurts medium 40 beats per minute I", "115:52", "think maybe there's a directional truth", "115:55", "to that but I I feel like when you're", "115:58", "talking about human longevity it's a", "116:00", "game of inches and that is like", "116:02", "something that's probably directionally", "116:04", "true within a mile now when you're", "116:06", "talking about human longevity and you", "116:08", "you know and you're thinking about all", "116:10", "these different things that you could do", "116:11", "to extend how much of that is", "116:15", "supplementation and do you supplement", "116:17", "like are you are you a person who takes", "116:20", "colloidal minerals or are you a person", "116:23", "that is interested in antioxidants like", "116:26", "what what do you do in terms of that so", "116:29", "I my view on longevity is it's just it's", "116:32", "the hardest problem there is and so you", "116:34", "got to have every like I'm agnostic", "116:37", "about what the approach is so I want to", "116:40", "understand everything that you can do", "116:41", "with respect to you know food drugs", "116:44", "supplements hormones and to be clear the", "116:47", "only difference between a drug and a", "116:49", "supplement is ones regulated and one is", "116:51", "not but you know I have patients that'll", "116:53", "say things like oh you know doctor I", "116:54", "don't want to take that drug I'd rather", "116:57", "do it

kind of a", "117:35", "one-size-fits-all approach to it because", "117:37", "I think you've got to be able to kind of", "117:38", "measure what's going on in a person get", "117:41", "a baseline and

like", "118:59", "that's that's probably not the range you", "119:01", "know so I personally think the range is", "119:02", "probably forty to sixty but I also", "119:04", "measure something called

ways that's that's if that's what I", "122:16", "spend most of my time dealing with is", "122:19", "what is a strategy for longevity that", "122:22", "becomes a scaffolding upon which you", "122:25",

"122:33", "we'll look back at stuff we're doing", "122:35", "today and thank God we have more data is", "122:37", "that still the right thing to do and so", "122:40", "that strategy to me is is sort of", "122:42", "fundamentally based on three bodies of", "122:44", "literature and the first is is like what", "122:47", "did we learn from centenarians so the", "122:48", "people who naturally live to a hundred", "122:51", "they have the advantage or that body of", "122:54", "literature has the advantage of being", "122:55", "based on humans it has the disadvantage", "122:58", "of it not being experimental so we you", "123:01", "know like we don't know like what cause", "123:02", "and effect was and then secondly if you", "123:05", "look at all of the animal literature or", "123:06", "nonhuman literature where you can", "123:08", "actually do the experiments what's", "123:09", "common there and then if you look at the", "123:12", "underlying molecular mechanisms so if", "123:14", "you feel like if you tie those three", "123:17", "together you come up with a general", "123:19", "scaffolding for what it means to live", "123:21", "longer and live healthier then we can", "123:25", "try to look at one thing at a time and", "123:28", "say hey vitamin D a Ornette antioxidant", "123:31", "yay or nay so when you're it's it's got", "123:35", "to be very time consuming for you I have", "123:38", "a research team I mean that's when I", "123:39", "started this practice about three years", "123:42", "ago I realized like I was losing the", "123:45", "battle my ability to sit", "123:47", "and read scientific papers was like", "123:48", "shrinking yeah so I hired an analyst you", "123:51", "know he had worked with me in the past", "123:53", "he was amazing", "123:54", "I brought him over full-time to do this", "123:56", "then another one then I mean now I have", "123:58", "four full-time analysts and I mean as", "124:01", "this practice grows and or you know", "124:03", "whatever I have the revenue to justify", "124:05", "it like I'll have ten analysts one day", "124:07", "in this practice and even that's not", "124:08", "enough", "124:09", "I mean approximately 100,000 papers are", "124:12", "published every month on PubMed Jesus", "124:15", "Christ", "124:16", "so I forget I did the math on that once", "124:17", "I think it's like three papers a minute", "124:19", "it's pretty stunning when you think", "124:21", "about the amount of human achievement", "124:22", "that we've experienced just in our", "124:23", "lifetime in that regard like how many", "124:25", "people are working on understanding just", "124:28", "the mechanisms of the human body and", "124:30", "this data is just piling up as we speak", "124:33", "yeah but the problem is the", "124:34", "signal-to-noise ratio is almost zero so", "124:36", "I would say conservatively 90% if not", "124:40", "99% of that is completely useless really", "124:43", "absolutely actually wrote about this", "124:46", "once so when a paper comes out if it is", "124:50", "never cited again meaning for the", "124:53", "remainder of time no one ever even goes", "124:56", "back to reference that paper you could", "124:58", "probably make the case that that paper", "124:59", "is not relevant and if you then further", "125:01", "strip out auto citations meaning the", "125:05", "only time it's ever cited is when the", "125:06", "author then goes back in cites his or", "125:08", "her own paper something like 70 or 80", "125:12", "percent of patient of papers never get", "125:14", "cited outside of an auto citation again", "125:18", "is this because they're not relevant or", "125:19", "does it possible to get lost lost in the", "125:21", "shuffle like some of them might be", "125:23", "probably possible but I would bet it is", "125:26", "much much more the former than the", "125:27", "latter and then on top of it a lot of", "125:31", "stuff comes out and then years later you", "125:32", "realize it was wrong you know or it was", "125:36", "and that's more often the case that it", "125:37", "was wrong through an honest mistake than", "125:39", "wrong through a dishonest mistake but", "125:41", "there's still a lot of wrong through", "125:42", "dishonest mistake stuffs coming out", "125:43", "there as well so how much of this data", "125:45", "is forcing you or causing you to alter", "125:48", "your own patterns well we we believe", "125:51", "internally that probably 100 papers a", "125:54", "month enter the literature that are", "125:57", "relevant to what we do meaning", "126:00", "I mean some of the literature that comes", "126:01", "out like you know the Rheumatology", "126:02", "literature might be relevant to them but", "126:04", "that's not what I think that's crazy", "126:06", "1/3 a day yeah yeah so that's why when I", "126:10", "say I want 10 analysts you see why yeah", "126:12", "it's like it's you got it because first", "126:14", "of all it's finding those papers too so", "126:16", "how do you do that like well we", "126:18", "subscribe to a whole bunch of services", "126:21", "that basically pre-filter a bunch of", "126:22", "shit for us and then we have a system", "126:26", "where we go about kind of pulling that", "126:28", "stuff so you get those three a day and", "126:30", "then they bring them to you how do you", "126:31", "have the time now so yeah that's the", "126:33", "thing it's funny you say that I was like", "126:35", "literally as I was driving here today I", "126:37", "was talking to a buddy of mine and I was", "126:38", "like dude I'm the fucking bottleneck and", "126:40", "I hate it like I'm now the bottleneck", "126:42", "because the analysts are now churning", "126:46", "out stuff faster than I can even provide", "126:48", "ancillary feedback because my job is", "126:51", "like you know you know you hire great", "126:53", "people who are smarter than you and like", "126:54", "you just guide them you just point them", "126:56", "in the right direction so what we mostly", "126:59", "do is create programs where we're going", "127:03", "out and looking for new knowledge so for", "127:05", "example one of the questions that is", "127:07", "tormenting me right now because I still", "127:08", "don't know the answer is is there any", "127:10", "benefit to taking human growth hormone", "127:12", "from a longevity perspective there's", "127:13", "clearly a performance benefit growth", "127:15", "hormone is probably the single most", "127:16", "abused drug in all of sports there's no", "127:18", "question about that but is there a way", "127:22", "to take it where it makes you live", "127:23", "longer", "127:24", "I've never prescribed growth hormone to", "127:25", "a patient because frankly I'm not yet", "127:28", "confident that I know the answer to that", "127:29", "question but I feel like it's worth", "127:32", "knowing right because I can certainly", "127:33", "make at elia logic for why growth", "127:36", "hormone could be helpful but I can also", "127:37", "make a theological argument for why it", "127:39", "could be harmful and so like many things", "127:43", "your knee-jerk reaction to something can", "127:45", "often be wrong and my knee-jerk reaction", "127:48", "to growth hormone has historically been", "127:49", "causes cancer", "127:51", "because why well growth hormone tells", "127:53", "your liver to make IGF insulin like", "127:55", "growth factor and you know 2/3 of tumors", "127:58", "seem to thrive on IGF so ostensibly you", "128:02", "would think well growth hormone can't be", "128:03", "right but then one of my analyst Bob", "128:05", "Caplan pointed out to me a year ago he's", "128:07", "like you know Peter I've been thinking", "128:08", "about this and he's like given how", "128:10", "ubiquitous growth hormone is in sports", "128:12", "and how long it's been ubiquitous in", "128:13", "sport", "128:14", "like I mean this was the drug that", "128:16", "turned around us Olympic athletes in the", "128:20", "late 70s early 80s he's like where's the", "128:22", "body count like where are all of these", "128:25", "people dying of cancer from all these", "128:27", "years of staggering growth hormone use I", "128:30", "don't really see it when we went back", "128:33", "and looked at literature I mean we found", "128:35", "that the data on growth hormone and", "128:37", "igf-1 is people have made it out to be", "128:41", "in fact there's a I mean I could draw it", "128:44", "actually for you not that anyone won't", "128:45", "necessarily see this but at least you'll", "128:46", "see what I'm talking about if this is", "128:49", "percentile so higher and this is IGF", "128:53", "level right so okay IDF level most", "128:58", "people are listening to this oh actually", "128:59", "it's really talking about that before", "129:02", "yeah so the overall mortality curve for", "129:07", "IGF and growth hormone is like a J curve", "129:11", "meaning low IGFs", "129:14", "really high mortality yes as you go from", "129:18", "about the 70th or 80th percentile up to", "129:20", "the 90th percentile there's a slight", "129:22", "increase in mortality but this is not", "129:25", "what you would think of like you would", "129:26", "sort of if you were just reading the", "129:28", "headlines you would think it looks like", "129:29", "this right so you there's a sweet spot", "129:31", "not only that if you this is overall", "129:34", "mortality what if you parse this out by", "129:35", "disease well that's when it gets really", "129:37", "interesting", "129:38", "so cancers curve looks like this very", "129:42", "similar yes", "129:44", "but Alzheimer's curve looks like this", "129:47", "heart disease curve looks like this so", "129:52", "describe that to people that are list", "129:54", "well so what that means is so for", "129:55", "example Alzheimer's disease and heart", "129:57", "disease have an almost monotonic", "129:59", "reduction in risk as IGF gets higher and", "130:02", "higher and higher it's only cancer that", "130:04", "seems to have that uptick where risk", "130:06", "starts to actually rise once you cross", "130:08", "past the call at 70th percentile and so", "130:12", "when you integrate all of these curves", "130:14", "together that's why you see this slight", "130:15", "uptick now again this is epidemiology so", "130:19", "one has to take this with a grain of", "130:20", "salt but this is to me when I saw this", "130:23", "graph which Bob put together I don't", "130:25", "know while ago", "130:27", "like wait a minute this doesn't jive", "130:29", "with my preconceived notion of like", "130:31", "growth hormone is bad this warrants way", "130:33", "further exploration and so what that", "130:36", "basically turned into is now an enormous", "130:39", "internal project that will take us", "130:40", "probably a year to complete and will", "130:43", "constantly be updated like we did this", "130:45", "already with testosterone two years ago", "130:46", "we put together like a 40 page white", "130:48", "paper on the topic and then at least", "130:51", "once every two weeks it gets updated", "130:52", "every time a new paper comes out", "130:54", "basically asking the question like is", "130:56", "testosterone replacement beneficial or", "130:58", "harmful and under what situations should", "131:00", "it be considered versus not and again", "131:02", "the goal is to do this unemotionally and", "131:05", "that's hard to do because for reasons", "131:09", "I'm not entirely clear on basically", "131:11", "everyone's kind of just emotional about", "131:13", "this stuff well they're emotional about", "131:14", "steroids because of all the press about", "131:16", "Barry Bonds and you know all the", "131:19", "different baseball players well I think", "131:21", "that is is it a cheating is it the", "131:23", "cheating aspect of it 100% yeah yeah I", "131:26", "think that's exactly what it is I think", "131:28", "people consider taking any kind of", "131:30", "hormone whether it's growth hormone or", "131:32", "testosterone as cheating even if you're", "131:35", "talking about older people that take it", "131:37", "like I was uh looking at one of those", "131:40", "ads you know they have those ads for",

what I say I", "133:34", "think it's 79 and 81 respectively for a", "133:36", "man and a woman today but the more", "133:38", "interesting question is this one which", "133:41", "is what year were you born", "133:42", "67 okay so in 1967 what was the annual", "133:47", "life expectancy or the average life", "133:49", "expectancy of a man and a woman and we", "133:51", "could look that up but I'm guessing it", "133:53", "would have been let's see life", "133:54", "expectancy has been going up at 0.3 to", "133:56", "0.6 percent per year we could back out", "133:58", "that kegger and let's just say for shits", "134:00", "and giggles like the number was 60 69 or", "134:03", "73 or something like that I promise you", "134:07", "you were gonna live long what was it 67", "134:10", "67 all right

the first five days eating", "140:24", "500 calories a day of a ketogenic diet", "140:27", "and it's basically just gonna be like", "140:29", "vegetables oil like it's you're", "140:31", "basically

know it", "141:53", "wasn't a junky guy the problem is he was", "141:55", "metabolically broken so I'll come back", "141:56", "to why I felt like this was a necessary", "141:58", "intervention despite

"early 70s or late 60s but it was the", "142:37", "longest ever medically supervised fast", "142:39", "so it was this guy who weighed somewhere", "142:41", "between 325 and 400 pounds", "142:43", "he did a 382 day inpatient medical fast", "142:47", "where he had only water and minerals at", "142:49", "the end of that something like 382 days", "142:51", "he was down from call it 402 a buck 65",

have", "143:04", "that problem that a lot of people have", "143:06", "when they lose a lot of weight where", "143:07", "they have all this extra skin his skin", "143:09", "went along with his body yeah and I", "143:12", "wonder if that's just a note of genetic", "143:14", "elasticity exactly I would like to know", "143:16", "I would like to know if he had stretch", "143:18", "marks when it shrank you know you know", "143:20", "it's funny I've never tried to figure", "143:22", "out like what ever came of that patient", "143:24", "I can't imagine he'd be alive now though", "143:26", "I know he was young at the time but the", "143:28", "part that interested me was that he", "143:31", "didn't regain all the weight 70 years", "143:33", "later right that suggested that there", "143:35", "was a like it was a reprogram well he", "143:38", "got the blue screen of death on the", "143:39", "computer he did the hard reset he got to", "143:42", "be a new person again because I'm", "143:44",

"143:52", "what broke was he basically lost the", "143:55", "ability to partition fuel correctly hmm", "143:58", "now could food play a role on that", "144:00", "absolutely certainly if you eat enough", "144:02", "shit that can happen but I think it's", "144:04", "more complicated than that I think it", "144:06", "could be epigenetic if not outright", "144:08", "genetic there probably more epigenetic", "144:10", "and so I'm interested in this idea of", "144:13", "how do you reset people and again this", "144:17", "is all kind of long-winded way of saying", "144:18", "like one of the advantages of practicing", "144:22", "medicine is you get to you you say", "144:24", "humble because every or every time you", "144:26", "think you're smart and you're like I got", "144:27", "this

"144:48", "hospitals in this country they can't", "144:50", "fucking come close to figure out what's", "144:52", "wrong with this guy and so as bad as", "144:56", "that is for him I think that level of", "144:59", "humility is actually good for the", "145:00", "profession it's good to what is going on", "145:02", "with him they can't figure he's having", "145:03", "these horrible neurologic

presenting like he had Lou", "145:13", "Gehrig's disease mmm which you know", "145:15", "obviously is about as bad a fate as you", "145:17", "can have luckily that has been ruled out", "145:20", "and

"145:50", "energy levels your mood all these things", "145:52", "what is was he done for that well I told", "145:55", "him today I was like look I'm gonna send", "145:56", "you a kit we're going to do", "145:57", "certain blood tests on you and a certain", "145:58", "urine test on you and I want to just", "146:00", "figure out what's going on with your for", "146:02", "hormone system just basically for", "146:03", "hormone systems that play a pretty big", "146:05", "role in how we feel and adjusting those", "146:08", "doesn't I'm not convinced it necessarily", "146:09", "makes you live

whether it's a result of", "146:19", "whatever is going on that nobody can", "146:20", "figure out or not but I'd rather focus", "146:23", "on something that I think we can fix hmm", "146:25", "yeah the the change in diet thing with", "146:28", "that guy where he went and fasted for", "146:32", "360 plus days what did he eat when he", "146:35", "got back on food great question I do not", "146:39", "know the answer now it might be that", "146:40", "that just I don't recall that being in", "146:42", "the paper but if it wasn't I don't know", "146:47", "if anybody did the follow-up but that's", "146:48", "to me that's the interesting question so", "146:50", "you got to feel amazing like he got his", "146:52", "life back right like and my recollection", "146:54", "is he was a young man he was in his late", "146:56", "20s I think yeah I believe I remember", "146:57", "that as well I think um I would like to", "147:00", "find out what he's eating now to keep", "147:02", "his weight at the same level I mean he", "147:04", "must just be so thankful first of all he", "147:06", "might be like I mean I have friends that", "147:09", "are pretty overweight and one that died", "147:12", "pretty recently who was really big and", "147:14", "he just had this feeling when he would", "147:17", "meet people I mean he talked about a", "147:19", "little bit he was just obese it was just", "147:22", "this thing where you're just oh look at", "147:25", "this enormous fat guy and then to go", "147:27", "from that to oh there's a guy there's a", "147:30", "normal guy yeah it's just a guy it's 168", "147:33", "pound I normal no difference between I", "147:35", "gotta tell ya I know we loved it we", "147:38", "loved to beat up on fat people mm-hmm we", "147:41", "loved to turn it into a character defect", "147:43", "but I gotta tell you virtually every fat", "147:45", "person that I know or that I've taken", "147:47", "care of they are not disproportionately", "147:50",

sense because", "169:19", "you could do you could muscle things and", "169:21", "do them wrong and develop bad habits and", "169:23", "you'll never reach your full potential", "169:25", "or you could
