idea is that the", "13:16", "solution would be if the government", "13:18", "takes over and we take more rich", "13:20", "people's taxes you know and he'll spout", "13:22", "off about income

that even politically it's", "94:43", "gonna start bubbling up I when I was in", "94:46", "DC the other day I was at a small dinner", "94:48", "with a pretty influential senator who", "94:50",

there", "95:06", "something there is something happening", "95:08", "and I think it will reach the political", "95:10", "level to that people will not want the", "95:13", "hysteria anymore and that eventually", "95:14", "Trump will because of his own craziness", "95:16", "become unnecessary you won't always need", "95:19", "the Icebreaker", "95:20", "we needed the Icebreaker to get all this",

"95:30", "maybe the Hitler comes mm-hmm I don't I", "95:33", "hope it doesn't happen but what I think", "95:35", "is that something decent is gonna come", "95:36", "that's just that's just I think", "95:38", "eventually something decent is going to", "95:41", "come and I think there is there's a lot", "95:43", "of decent that's coming right now but I", "95:45", "think there's some people that are", "95:45", "always going to resist that", "95:46", "oh of course people that are just", "95:48", "ideologically driven and they can't be", "95:49", "shaken from they can't be shook from", "95:52", "that position they're just they're hard", "95:54", "left or they're hard right or whatever", "95:55", "they are they they have this rigid idea", "95:57", "in their head of what reality is and", "95:59", "anything that's contrary to that they're", "96:02", "gonna oppose and I think Jordan has been", "96:04", "one of my favorite lightning rods for", "96:06", "observation for watching this but all", "96:09", "the disingenuous articles about him", "96:11", "deceptive talking about his positions", "96:14", "and extremely inaccurate ways and", "96:17", "labeling him as some sort of a", "96:19", "prejudiced terrible person what those", "96:22", "have done is solidified this idea that", "96:26", "there is a campaign of people that just", "96:29", "are completely ideologically driven and", "96:32", "they don't mind being deceptive yeah and", "96:34", "that strengthens the positive it helps", "96:37", "people like us to just talk about stuff", "96:39", "and don't mind talking about being", "96:41", "incorrect or ignorant or not worried you", "96:44", "know we're not worried about our stance", "96:46", "you just we're going about most", "96:49", "conversations from a place of",

and", "97:00", "just talking about things and this is", "97:03", "this is something that's not happening", "97:05", "in these little click Beatty articles or", "97:07", "in people that interrupt your shows and", "97:10", "shake fuckin jars and nickels or", "97:12", "whatever they're doing looks like", "97:13", "there's that all that stuff strengthens", "97:16", "this position that we're in that we're", "97:18", "in this weird", "97:20", "of intellectual dishonesty and turmoil", "97:23", "and I think a lot of it is because", "97:25", "there's a lot of people that would just", "97:27", "extremely upset the Trump got into", "97:29", "office and anything that seems to", "97:31", "represent that position on that side", "97:32", "must be opposed violently yeah so I", "97:35", "think underneath everything you're", "97:36", "saying right there", "97:37", "you're very hopeful right yeah I", "97:39", "actually sense that you're really", "97:40", "hopeful and I am too and it's like how", "97:42", "could we ever do this if we weren't", "97:43", "right like I would say that I'm oh if I", "97:46", "had to like sort of Whittle it down what", "97:47", "I am it at the core I basically I'm a", "97:50", "world weary optimist like I'm an", "97:52", "optimist by nature but I believe that", "97:54", "the world the world is rough-and-tumble", "97:56", "and all the things that Jordan would say", "97:58", "about existence I believe but I'm still", "98:01", "an optimist despite that and what you", "98:03", "just said right there basically is", "98:05", "showing that the Trump thing was", "98:07", "necessary because imagine if Hillary was", "98:09", "president right now in the same machine", "98:11", "and bullshit nonsense and media and all", "98:14", "of that stuff kept churning along think", "98:16", "how much worse it would be for these", "98:17", "conversations right now we would so be", "98:19", "on the wrongs the you know the wrong", "98:21", "side of things so to speak and the", "98:23", "forces that don't want us to do anything", "98:25", "good and have conversations would have", "98:27", "been so emboldened Trump just came and", "98:29", "took a freaking bat to the whole thing", "98:31", "now as I discussed with Eric Weinstein", "98:33", "it's like Trump was the bull in the", "98:34", "china shop I think most of us would have", "98:36", "preferred a panther way like we kind of", "98:38", "wanted something to walk through knock a", "98:39", "few things off Trump just blew up the", "98:41", "whole thing you don't the phrase is bull", "98:43", "in a china shop not a panther in a china", "98:44", "shop that's right so that's what you get", "98:46", "but after this for every reason you just", "98:50", "said there is going to be a return to", "98:53", "sanity it I goes one of two ways but I", "98:56", "just I'm a firm believer that it will go", "98:58", "that way that there is enough of us out", "98:59", "there now trying to reset things and", "99:01", "because I don't think people are evil I", "99:03", "don't think people want to be talked", "99:05", "down to I don't think people are dumb oh", "99:06", "and even the people who are dumb I don't", "99:08", "think they want to be dumb and because", "99:10", "of all of that I think this was the", "99:13", "necessary thing to happen right now I'm", "99:15", "with you that I think I hope that he", "99:17", "continues to do basically good things", "99:19", "and that if that means that he gets in", "99:21", "for another four years and continues to", "99:23", "do good things then so be it but yes", "99:25", "what I prefer that it's sort of more of", "99:28", "a small government calm person who could", "99:30", "tell you how many branches of government", "99:31", "there are", "99:32", "and like all of that shit and all of the", "99:35", "stuff from that flag that's right behind", "99:36", "you yeah I've got a frickin Declaration", "99:39", "of Independence in our control

Oval Office yes", "99:48", "you don't get everything you want in", "99:50", "life so you just kind of work with what", "99:52", "comes and I think we could we have a", "99:54", "little broom to work right now I think", "99:56", "also as more people open themselves up", "99:59", "to the ideas that Jordan is espousing or", "100:02", "you are I am or more people are", "100:04", "genuinely objective about these ideas", "100:07", "start discussing them the more frantic", "100:10", "the people on the radical left in the", "100:13", "the what they call the regressive left", "100:15", "the more ridiculous they're gonna get", "100:17", "and the more obvious is gonna get that", "100:19", "they're out of control", "100:20", "yeah it's just what happens people start", "100:21", "ranting and

that there's no logical message", "100:31", "there but think about that so when", "100:32", "that's exactly what they're doing with", "100:34", "Trump - you keep screaming Trump's", "100:36", "Hitler right you keep screaming Trump's", "100:37", "Hitler Hitler Hitler now Hitler killed", "100:39", "millions and millions of people and many", "100:41", "more millions were killed because of", "100:42",

guys aren't", "101:09", "all nuts but if they just if they", "101:11", "destroy all of our ability to have this", "101:13", "conversation", "101:14", "then when the real Hitler comes in we", "101:16",

this deregulation guy yeah who", "127:37", "goes after you when you dump shit into", "127:38", "the river so I'm not saying there should", "127:40", "be no regulation I just who saying that", "127:41", "I like this", "127:42", "generally I like this line of thinking", "127:44", "there has to be some regulation I agree", "127:46", "you can't but what I would say that's", "127:48", "where the regulation comes let's put it", "127:49", "this way the environment yeah that I", "127:51", "would say there has to be some but I've", "127:53", "had some interesting people on", "127:54",

right so", "128:13", "that but that's him doing it privately", "128:15", "right yeah yeah but what is like what's", "128:18", "the solution if some", "128:19", "pollutes if you're not going to have", "128:21", "regulation what is the solution if", "128:22", "someone does something that's illegal", "128:24", "well if you're not gonna have a", "128:26", "regulation it wouldn't be illegal but",

polluting willful poisoning of", "128:39", "rivers I'm sure he's actually terrorism", "128:41", "right yeah it would be a bunch of like", "128:43", "so what those guys would argue is what I", "128:45", "said before which is that ultimately", "128:47", "especially now because of technology", "128:49", "like in the old days so like every time", "128:51", "someone cuts a regulation I've heard", "128:52", "Bill Maher say this a lot they're gonna", "128:53", "start polluting the river immediately", "128:55", "that implies that these businessmen", "128:57", "whatever they're you know

the", "129:26", "last couple hours about about people", "129:28", "getting involved a lot of the things I", "129:30", "think would start self-regulating but", "129:33", "again and then I won't say it again I'm", "129:34", "not for just deregulating everything I", "129:37", "just think there's probably better ways", "129:38", "to do it than just having the government", "129:41", "come in and say

don't have to do the", "155:31", "legwork of the argue right it's a lot", "155:33", "harder to take a position that says you", "155:35", "should be who you are and you have to", "155:37", "fit that
