Dre Snoop", "00:26", "Dogg all those people yeah but I was the", "00:29", "LA Weekly music editor and I started", "00:32", "looking into this story about why people", "00:34", "were always dying at raves so like I", "00:37", "don't know if you remember a few years", "00:38", "back every time there was a rave there", "00:40", "like one person died new people died", "00:42", "anymore", "00:43", "and they always said it was from ecstasy", "00:45", "but I knew that ecstasy was really not", "00:48", "that dangerous of a drug you know MDMA", "00:51", "pure MDMA very few people died from that", "00:54", "so I was like what is going on here", "00:56", "and I looked into it and turned out it", "00:58", "was all adulterated it wasn't real", "01:00", "ecstasy wasn't real Molly", "01:02", "it was adulterated with all these new", "01:04", "drugs and I kind of went down the rabbit", "01:07", "hole and I found out that all these new", "01:09", "drugs were made in China they're all", "01:12", "synthetic and there were like hundreds", "01:15", "of them and then it turns out that the", "01:17", "most you know the worst of them was", "01:20", "fentanyl and that's how I got under the", "01:22", "topic and in fence you know most people", "01:25", "think of fentanyl they think of it as", "01:27", "being a new thing but it's not really a", "01:29", "new thing right was wasn't it it was", "01:31", "invented in the 50s yeah yeah I was", "01:34", "invented by a Belgian chemist he was", "01:37", "trying to find something that worked", "01:39", "better than morphine in hospitals", "01:42", "it doesn't morphine work really good", "01:44", "well it does but for things like yeah", "01:46", "traditionally people have got a lot of", "01:48", "mileage out of morphine but for things", "01:51", "like open-heart surgery he wants", "01:53", "something that came on really fast and", "01:55", "it lasted a long time and so he", "01:58", "manipulated the chemical structure of", "02:00", "morphine came up with fentanyl it was a", "02:03", "blockbuster drug you know and still is", "02:05", "used in hospitals all the time it's used", "02:09", "you know there's the fentanyl patch for", "02:11", "people with cancer", "02:13", "Payne and then when you get a like a", "02:15", "colonoscopy they give you fentanyl", "02:18", "before that and then women who have", "02:21", "epidural is doing childbirth that I", "02:23", "believe he's usually fentanyl so it's", "02:26", "still an important hospital drug and so", "02:29", "how did it come to be that this drug", "02:32", "from the 1950s sort of reimburses and", "02:34", "reemerged during the rave scene is that", "02:37", "what it was it was actually before that", "02:39", "it first started killing people a little", "02:40", "bit at the beginning of the 80s and", "02:43", "nobody knew what it was it was from", "02:45", "China then as well no back then it was", "02:49", "these kind of mystery chemists these", "02:51", "guys who there was this one guy in", "02:53", "particular called George Marquardt and", "02:55", "he was like a genius maniac who read all", "02:59", "the chemical literature he learned about", "03:02", "Fenton Fenton Ellie's like I should try", "03:04", "to make this I bet it would be a hit", "03:05", "with recreational users and so he", "03:09", "started making it and it stumped", "03:12", "authorities because these people would", "03:14", "die they would have track marks in their", "03:16", "arms like it was heroin they would have", "03:18", "syringes but they tested them afterwards", "03:21", "and there's no heroin in their system", "03:23", "and so they're like what is this and the", "03:27", "only way they finally found out was that", "03:29", "there was this scientist testing racing", "03:32", "horses and apparently fentanyl was being", "03:35", "used to dope horses to like so they", "03:40", "would withstand more pain and would go", "03:42", "longer and faster and completely train", "03:45", "harder yeah and so so this guy made the", "03:48", "connection he's like oh this is fentanyl", "03:50", "this is this new thing and he actually", "03:52", "predicted what was going to happen he's", "03:54", "like we are in trouble now because not", "03:57", "only is there fentanyl you can make a", "03:59", "new if you ban fentanyl you can adjust", "04:02", "the molecule make another type of fence", "04:04", "know when they ban that can make another", "04:06", "one ad infinitum basically Wow so the", "04:11", "thing with horses would be that they", "04:13", "would be in pain so they wouldn't run as", "04:14", "hard so they would force them to run", "04:17", "harder by dulling the pain I guess so", "04:19", "yeah I don't know all the details of it", "04:21", "but you know it's performance enhancing", "04:23", "basis and it seemed kind of", "04:25", "counterintuitive you would think that", "04:26", "like an opiate would like make the", "04:27", "sleepy right well I don't know maybe", "04:30", "just has a different effect on horses so", "04:34", "then the Internet comes along and", "04:36", "through the internet", "04:38", "people started scouring the medical", "04:41", "literature and scientific literature and", "04:44", "chemical literature and then they find", "04:46", "fentanyl exactly yeah because back in", "04:49", "the old days you you know scientists", "04:52", "would publish a paper they're trying to", "04:54", "find a new drug that they can patent say", "04:57", "the drug isn't a hit no one wants to buy", "05:00", "it it goes on some dusty university", "05:03", "shelf never is heard from again", "05:04", "but in the Internet age all of these", "05:07", "papers start going online and so these", "05:10", "rogue chemists that I reference until my", "05:13", "book they start finding particular", "05:16", "scientists who work on the type of drugs", "05:19", "they're interested in and then they", "05:20", "start going through all their papers and", "05:22", "they pick out drugs that they think", "05:26", "would work recreationally and so when", "05:28", "fentanyl first came out it was totally", "05:30", "legal people you could walk around with", "05:33", "a giant bag of it they couldn't do", "05:34", "anything and so it set in motion this", "05:37", "sort of cat-and-mouse game between law", "05:40", "enforcement and drug chemists which", "05:42", "really still persists to this day", "05:43", "although mostly in China now have you", "05:46", "ever experienced any opiates personally", "05:49", "I've taken", "05:50", "yeah like tramadol in like Tylenol three", "05:54", "and stuff like that I don't know three", "05:55", "years opiates", "05:56", "I think it's codeine which is a", "05:58", "low-level opioid and I don't know to me", "06:00", "it always gets me stoned but it never", "06:02", "seems to like deal with the problem I", "06:04", "don't really like Opie I just you know", "06:06", "what I mean it's like I can't sleep and", "06:08", "it's just not like that's not your thing", "06:09", "yeah I had the old nyquil had codeine", "06:13", "didn't it didn't it did we've been over", "06:16", "this haven't we didn't we try to figure", "06:17", "this out I I remember I took nyquil in", "06:20", "the 90s in the late 90s I was sick like", "06:23", "the last time I ever took it and it was", "06:25", "wonderful I was lying I had going this", "06:27", "is amazing I only give a shit oh fuck", "06:29", "yeah I heard I'm sick a lot of people", "06:31", "say that I just sank into the bed I was", "06:34", "like", "06:35", "and another time I had a morphine drip", "06:37", "at knee surgery and they gave me a", "06:39", "little morphine drip and he's an every", "06:40", "time I want it I could just hit this", "06:42", "button uh-huh and get a little more", "06:44", "hammering that just lying in bed well", "06:47", "that's like the irony of the opioids it", "06:50", "can produce the greatest pleasure you", "06:52", "know and the greatest pain you know I", "06:55", "think Sam quinones said that like how", "06:59", "can one molecule give you the greatest", "07:02", "pleasure imaginable and the worst pain", "07:03", "imaginable yeah Lenny Bruce had some", "07:06", "crazy quote about it something about", "07:08", "that of like getting hugged by God I", "07:11", "forget what the quote was but i-i've", "07:14", "never had experience with heroin but I", "07:18", "knew I've known people that were addicts", "07:20", "quite a few and a couple of them that", "07:23", "died and one of them that I knew there", "07:25", "was this guy he was a pool hustler back", "07:28", "of my pool playing days in New York and", "07:30", "his nickname was water dog I forget his", "07:32", "real name I think was Bill but another", "07:35", "was Buffalo Bills his other nickname I", "07:36", "don't remember his real name but anyway", "07:38", "this guy was an elite pool player", "07:40", "big-time gambler but the thing was he", "07:42", "had to do heroin first so like they", "07:45", "would play games for like $10,000 these", "07:48", "huge games and all these guys would come", "07:51", "from the tri-state area they would come", "07:53", "around to watch these matches in bed on", "07:55", "the side and water dog would go to the", "07:59", "bathroom and everybody knew what was", "08:01", "going on he would go and shoot up and", "08:03", "they would come and he would sit on a", "08:05", "chair like this just sit there for like", "08:09", "half an hour just sit there and then", "08:13", "when it was over when the half hour was", "08:15", "over he just like he couldn't miss and", "08:20", "he was playing this guy this this dude", "08:24", "that I knew named George who was also a", "08:26", "big-time gambler and he was screaming", "08:28", "and yelling that this motherfucker when", "08:30", "he's on this stuff he can't miss he had", "08:32", "no nerves like nothing bothered him you", "08:34", "could scream in his face he would look", "08:36", "at you like an alien like it didn't", "08:38", "didn't bother him at all like like an", "08:39", "insect would look at you and he had this", "08:43", "incredible ability to play like at the", "08:47", "very best", "08:48", "while he was fucked up on heroin and I", "08:51", "remember thinking what a bizarre drug I", "08:54", "mean think about all the amazing artists", "08:56", "that it's clean yeah I think about jazz", "08:58", "and John the cream yeah Lenny Bruce so", "09:02", "many people I mean you go down the line", "09:05", "all these different folks I mean that", "09:07", "mug shot that I have out there of", "09:08", "Hendrix yes", "09:09", "heroin Toronto yeah I mean people like", "09:14", "people prefer heroin defense until like", "09:17", "I've heard it described as more soulful", "09:19", "people say but the thing is you can't", "09:22", "even get heroin in most parts of America", "09:24", "like pure heroin anymore it's all cut", "09:26", "with fentanyl well you gotta go straight", "09:28", "to Afghanistan right that's probably", "09:31", "probably Mexico yeah yeah Jesus Christ", "09:35", "no the can you grow poppies what can", "09:40", "that be grown in the yeah I just walk", "09:43", "around on this true like nice", "09:45", "neighborhoods you'll see poppies all the", "09:47", "time you just don't even know you're", "09:48", "looking at him and that's actually", "09:50", "heroin like you could get one from those", "09:52", "poppies yeah it's like if they grow now", "09:54", "you know organically and you're not", "09:57", "doing it on purpose it's no big deal but", "09:59", "if you start cultivating it that's when", "10:01", "it becomes just got a place to know", "10:03", "they're beautiful look how pretty", "10:05", "yeah you also have San Pedro cactus on", "10:07", "your lawn sir oh those are pretty too", "10:09", "right yeah yeah I mean

is", "10:41", "you know I mean I just know people that", "10:44", "party I know people that take pills and", "10:47", "it seems like fentanyl is things are", "10:52", "getting cut with fentanyl a lot it's not", "10:54", "you know it's not an uncommon thing for", "10:58", "all sorts of different drugs look how", "11:00", "many different drugs are cut with", "11:01", "fentanyl", "11:02", "street drug oh man it is like an awful", "11:04", "time to be a young person on the party", "11:06", "scene you know like when I was coming up", "11:09", "and probably when you were coming up", "11:10", "they said the DARE program and all that", "11:13", "say no just say no they made it sound", "11:15", "like every drug could kill you right now", "11:17", "unfortunately that's like almost reality", "11:21", "that basically any pill or any powder if", "11:25", "you didn't get your pill from CVS you", "11:28", "know your pain pill or from a pharmacy", "11:30", "that's legit it could be cut with", "11:32", "fentanyl and that's how prince died", "11:35", "that's how Tom Petty and the rapper Mac", "11:38", "Miller all died is that they were taught", "11:41", "they were taking legitimate pain pills", "11:43", "is that really what happened", "11:44", "that is really what happened it's got", "11:46", "his from the black market yeah well the", "11:49", "guy who supplied Prince has been he", "11:51", "refuses to really say exactly where he", "11:53", "got it but he's still alive", "11:55", "the guy who got in for Prince yeah where", "11:58", "is he", "11:58", "I don't know I think in Minneapolis or", "12:01", "so they should find that fucking guy", "12:02", "well the doctor is also like settled it", "12:08", "or something I think the doctor might", "12:10", "have been involved somehow", "12:11", "it's a mystery where he got these pills", "12:13", "but you know Prince was like doing the", "12:15", "splits on stage at age you know 58 or", "12:18", "whatever and he was definitely a guy who", "12:20", "walked around with a lot of pain he was", "12:22", "Jehovah's Witness he was not a", "12:24", "recreational drug user as we think about", "12:27", "it you know he was he wanted pain and", "12:30", "I'm sure for years his handler or", "12:32", "whatever was buying him off the darknet", "12:34", "or whatever and they were fine for years", "12:37", "but but then a drug dealer trying to", "12:40", "save some money increase profits cut it", "12:43", "with fentanyl and that's that's how he", "12:45", "died and I heard Tom Petty actually", "12:48", "suffered an injury or hurt himself at", "12:51", "one of his concerts and he just", "12:54", "literally walked outside and asked like", "12:58", "the first sketchy guy he saw if he had", "13:01", "any pain pills and that's what killed", "13:03", "him Jesus Christ Oh God and in Prince", "13:10", "needed hip replacement surgery didn't he", "13:12", "I think that's right No", "13:14", "so common for some reason with people", "13:16", "who perform on stage who do a lot of", "13:18", "like jumping around and going crazy my", "13:21", "friend Maynard lead singer of tulle yeah", "13:23", "he was he does jiu-jitsu he's really", "13:25", "into jiu-jitsu and he's like man I just", "13:27", "have no movement in my hip my hip is", "13:28", "like so locked up and the doctor went to", "13:31", "look at it and they're like hey bro", "13:32", "you've got no hip left like it's just", "13:34", "shot and it was from stompin on stage he", "13:38", "sings he fucking style time in that one", "13:41", "hip he

know well they can do something", "13:55", "about that now can ya before your mom", "13:57", "goes and gets her neck cut open there's", "13:59", "several options one first of all as it's", "14:03", "been explained to me the concept of", "14:05", "degenerative disc disease it gives you", "14:08", "this it implies that there's a disease", "14:11", "yeah like you caught a flu that's not", "14:13", "you know it's not what it is is bad", "14:16", "posture wearing down compression you", "14:21", "carrying weight if people carry a lot of", "14:23", "things their discs get smushed over time", "14:25", "there's a lot of different factors a lot", "14:27", "of athletes get a lot of fighters get a", "14:29", "lot of wrestlers jiu-jitsu guys they all", "14:30", "get it I got it and as you wear

and grappling", "14:43", "but I found a thing called Regina Kane", "14:46", "and with Regina Kane is what Peyton", "14:48", "Manning used he actually went to Germany", "14:50", "to go do it but now you can do it here", "14:51", "in America", "14:53", "Kobe Bryant went and got it done as well", "14:55", "it's great for people with back issues", "14:57", "disk issues and with bulging discs in", "15:00", "particular it helps relax the area", "15:02", "around the discs it's is your own blood", "15:04", "and there's all there's a some sort of", "15:06", "strange procedure they do but they take", "15:08", "your own blood it's like a very advanced", "15:09", "form of platelet-rich plasma and there's", "15:12", "a place called lifespan medicine in", "15:14", "Santa Monica they did it for me", "15:18", "everything bad everything back yeah I", "15:20", "mean depending upon how far gone it is", "15:23", "you know some people it's already", "15:24", "bone-on-bone there's no disc you know", "15:26", "and you got to catch", "15:27", "before that happens yeah and another", "15:30", "thing they're doing is they're shooting", "15:31", "stem cells directly into the disks and", "15:34", "they're having some really good results", "15:35", "with that where the stem cells but a lot", "15:38", "of that they'll be doing that in other", "15:39", "countries because it's there they're a", "15:42", "lot looser with their regulations if", "15:44", "they have any regulation at all yeah", "15:46", "just fucking fill you up with stem cells", "15:48", "yeah and everything starts regenerating", "15:50", "yeah but but yeah and it's not just", "15:54", "these pills either it's like and like", "15:57", "you have daughters I know who are you", "16:00", "know maybe getting towards

sometimes and those are", "18:48", "people call it synthetic marijuana but", "18:50", "the big difference is that THC is known", "18:55", "as like a partial agonist so it will", "18:58", "like these receptors it will it will", "19:00", "activate them to an extent you're", "19:02", "chilled it's relaxed but the", "19:05", "cannabinoids they also interact with the", "19:08", "cannabinoid receptors

"22:11", "tested on human subjects but this guy", "22:13", "was entirely specialized in fentanyl", "22:17", "analogues and synthetic cannabinoids and", "22:20", "so he took out you know he had his like", "22:22", "fake list on his website of all the", "22:24", "legitimate you know like cialis and you", "22:27", "know legitimate pharmaceuticals things", "22:29", "like that but as at his apartment he", "22:32", "showed me the real list and that had all", "22:34", "these you know it was cannabinoids", "22:36", "fentanyl it was like fake valium like", "22:39", "different types of xanax and he showed", "22:43", "me the prices and I was like all right", "22:45", "looks good can I can I go see your lab", "22:47", "and so finally he decided he trusted me", "22:50", "he called up his

minutes to the outskirts of Shanghai", "23:13", "and we got to the lab and it just looked", "23:17", "like a regular office park like a", "23:18", "suburban office park there was a", "23:20", "fountain in in front of the building", "23:23", "there was like you know you use the", "23:25", "keycard to get in the parking lot and", "23:27", "then it looked like kind of a new", "23:30", "construction building it smelled like", "23:31", "cement we went inside we went up to to", "23:36", "the labs all the windows were open", "23:37", "there's the middle of the winter and it", "23:39", "was kind of a strong chemical smell but", "23:42", "it looked kind of just like Breaking Bad", "23:43", "like you know like industrial sized", "23:47", "glassware", "23:49", "you know beakers Bunsen burners all that", "23:53", "stuff from high school chemistry and he", "23:56", "would points he points out like", "23:57", "basically I had my recorder you know on", "24:00", "my phone and I had it in my jacket", "24:03", "pocket just on record and so he told me", "24:06", "I couldn't take pictures and so to take", "24:08", "notes I would just say stuff aloud I'd", "24:12", "be like oh that's oranges a a light", "24:17", "orange mixture that's being mixed up I", "24:19", "make", "24:20", "alarm and you say it's benzo fentanyl a", "24:22", "very interesting and so but but the", "24:25", "language barrier was such that he you", "24:27", "know didn't think I was being too much", "24:29", "of a weirdo that clearly was but so but", "24:34", "the cannabinoids would it were crazy", "24:37", "there was like a table like this like", "24:39", "almost exactly this size that was piled", "24:41", "up with the cannabinoids that were there", "24:44", "for drying and it was a they were mounds", "24:46", "like this high just sitting right out in", "24:48", "the open what they look like this is", "24:50", "look like pot no because it's not a", "24:54", "plant you know it's just basically it's", "24:56", "a chemical that's sprayed onto plant", "24:59", "matter like dried sage and stuff like", "25:02", "that really so they try to make it look", "25:04", "like pot and you know you can smoke that", "25:06", "stuff out of a pipe or even roll it into", "25:08", "a joint but it if you look closely", "25:10", "though it's very clearly not pod Wow", "25:13", "and so they're drying this stuff that's", "25:16", "what I think that I'm you know they also", "25:18", "had like drying machines it looked like", "25:22", "Matador didn't like it when I use this", "25:24", "term but you know when you go into", "25:25", "subway and there's the bread baking", "25:27", "machines right there yeah it looked", "25:29", "exactly like that why did he not like", "25:31", "that term of though I don't know I think", "25:33", "he thought subway would sue us or", "25:34", "something but but they had those and", "25:38", "then they had like big buckets of", "25:40", "one-pound bags of these these", "25:43", "cannabinoids and these fentanyl analogs", "25:45", "just ready for shipping he said they", "25:47", "were sending them to Russia to Belgium", "25:49", "to the Netherlands and then I think a", "25:51", "lot of times that's repackaged there and", "25:55", "so I don't know if you knew that the", "25:56", "cannabinoids like used to be sold", "25:58", "legally in head shops like 10 years ago", "26:01", "yeah yeah and they would always be in", "26:03", "these colorful packets they almost look", "26:05", "like a pop rocks bracket they say like", "26:07", "spice spice and laugh-out-loud and stuff", "26:11", "and so I think in Europe that's where", "26:14", "they do that they put it in this", "26:15", "colorful packaging they and then they", "26:19", "ship it to the US and but yeah he was", "26:23", "saying that like he kept like really", "26:26", "close track of the law and all these", "26:28", "countries especially China like they're", "26:31", "scheduling this next week so", "26:33", "we're gonna take all this and throw it", "26:34", "away and I thought at first he was like", "26:37", "probably just putting me on but I think", "26:38", "they actually do that like these guys", "26:40", "are businessmen first and they want to", "26:43", "make money and going to follow the law", "26:46", "it just doesn't you know it's not I can", "26:48", "do sir this is where bath salt came from", "26:51", "right exactly yeah bath salts tend to be", "26:54", "Kathryn owns so synthetic cathinones", "26:56", "there have you heard of the cat plant", "26:58", "Kait yes the the hijackers pirates in", "27:04", "Somali yeah yeah it's really popular in", "27:07", "the Middle East it's like it's a", "27:08", "stimulant against you really have you", "27:11", "tried it no I never have yeah but I grew", "27:15", "up in Minnesota though and there's a big", "27:17", "Somali population and so a lot of there", "27:19", "was a big controversy in Minnesota", "27:21", "whether or not to ban cat leaves from", "27:23", "being sold in regular stores is it legal", "27:25", "I think it is I think it's not legal in", "27:28", "the US now if I'm not but I don't know", "27:30", "for sure interesting but so kh8 ease up", "27:34", "yeah exactly", "27:34", "and so the synthetic cathinone czar the", "27:37", "synthetic version of that like made in", "27:39", "the lab but they're there you know", "27:41", "there's tons of different kinds you", "27:43", "don't know how strong it is and the bath", "27:46", "salts they of course it has nothing to", "27:50", "do with like salts for your bath you", "27:52", "know this was a misnomer and they also", "27:55", "wrote called them like incense and", "27:58", "sometimes plant food and on the back of", "28:01", "all of them it would say not intended", "28:03", "for human consumption so that was like", "28:06", "the way they got around they thought", "28:08", "they could get around the federal analog", "28:11", "Act because part of the law says that", "28:12", "something is automatically illegal if", "28:15", "it's intended for human consumption", "28:17", "hmm so these guys just put in your bath", "28:20", "yeah he bath smells like fucking toxic", "28:23", "chemicals yeah do you remember when the", "28:26", "homeless guy ate someone's face remember", "28:28", "that and they said he was on base yeah", "28:29", "but that was actually disproven there", "28:31", "was none found in his system yes crazy", "28:33", "cannibal the Cosway cannibal I think", "28:36", "that yeah yeah and he was just crazy", "28:38", "right I think he may have liked smoke", "28:40", "some weed but yeah I don't think he had", "28:42", "anything else in his system it was just", "28:44", "high on life yeah", "28:47", "man the Lord you know geranyl Florida", "28:50", "man yeah it is it's funny that one state", "28:54", "is so synonymous with fuckery yeah", "28:57", "and they also had this thing called", "28:58", "Flocka have you heard of that yes I have", "29:01", "but I don't remember what it is it's", "29:02", "more Kathleen owns and like if you look", "29:04", "it up on YouTube there's all these", "29:05", "people going crazy I killed like I think", "29:08", "maybe a hundred people in Florida during", "29:10", "a time and the problem is you know like", "29:14", "the prohibition on drugs causes people", "29:16", "to do really stupid things right so you", "29:19", "have this cathinone like Flocka and as", "29:23", "bad as that was once they banned Flocka", "29:26", "the chemists started manipulating the", "29:28", "chemical structure so they change one", "29:31", "little thing they add like a chlorine", "29:32", "group for example so like a chlorine", "29:36", "like molecule you know it has nothing to", "29:40", "do with the drug but they just add it on", "29:43", "there to make it so it becomes legal hmm", "29:45", "but then it becomes more difficult for", "29:48", "your body to like digest it so it", "29:50", "becomes worse for you and the high", "29:52", "becomes worse and then they ban that and", "29:55", "then they make something new that's even", "29:57", "worse for you and it's just like down", "30:00", "the line and and these Chinese so so", "30:03", "that's what all these new drugs have in", "30:05", "common my book is about", "30:07", "they're called NPS novel psychoactive", "30:10", "substances so fentanyl is the most", "30:12", "famous and the most dangerous but these", "30:15", "include basically like synthetic new", "30:18", "versions of every drug so there's you", "30:20", "know marijuana the new the NPS version", "30:23", "is the synthetic cannabinoids heroin NPS", "30:25", "version is fentanyl there's LSD so you", "30:28", "take LSD it's like a wonder drug", "30:30", "right no one has ever died of an LSD", "30:33", "overdose you know people may have", "30:35", "thought they were a bird or whatever and", "30:37", "jumped off a roof but no one has ever", "30:39", "overdosed on the drug itself but but", "30:42", "once they started banning once they", "30:44", "started really cracking down on LSD", "30:46", "these Chinese chemists started", "30:48", "manufacturing this new type of", "30:50", "psychedelic that was sold as acid and so", "30:54", "if you went on the dark web this was", "30:56", "like in the like ten years ago or so tip", "31:00", "five ten years ago", "31:01", "you would search for acid and it you", "31:04", "would think you were buying LSD but you", "31:07", "were buying this new psychedelic that", "31:09", "could kill you and did kill you", "31:11", "these drugs are called n-bombs it's like", "31:14", "the worst name of all time these these", "31:17", "n-bomb drugs and they started killing", "31:19", "people and like the suburbs and dallas", "31:23", "and really were a music editor yeah so", "31:33", "so these kids all thought they just", "31:35", "wanted they did their research these", "31:37", "were like smart kids who said oh LSD has", "31:39", "never killed anyone", "31:40", "let's get that this new thing and it", "31:42", "killed them and so it wasn't really LSD", "31:45", "it was just so it totally no no no", "31:47", "really yeah now the crazy thing is that", "31:51", "this probably could be fixed with", "31:54", "legalizing all drugs but nobody wants to", "31:56", "legalize all drugs it's such a catch-22", "31:58", "because like if you had heroin available", "32:01", "at the corner store you would have no", "32:03", "need to buy fentanyl and if it was like", "32:05", "at a reasonable price where they", "32:06", "couldn't undercut you like hey heroines", "32:08", "five bucks I'll sell it for a dollar", "32:10", "yeah it's it's a terrible thing to even", "32:12", "say I don't want people to be able to", "32:14", "just go buy meth yeah well the way to", "32:17", "think about it I think is like", "32:19", "decriminalization a lot of times is like", "32:22", "a better alternative in my opinion in my", "32:25", "you know my research and then", "32:28", "legalization right so like the", "32:30", "presidential candidate Andrew yang talks", "32:33", "about decriminalizing Oprah opioids", "32:35", "right and so when I first heard about", "32:37", "that I was like what I was like that is", "32:39", "a bridge too far but the more you think", "32:42", "about it it's like people get arrested", "32:44", "for using fentanyl they go to jail and", "32:48", "then the recidivism rate is like through", "32:51", "the roof people like get out and they", "32:54", "start using again they don't get the", "32:55", "treatment they need you know and so the", "32:59", "opiate you know like people don't", "33:00", "realize that fentanyl is killing more", "33:03", "people than any drug in American history", "33:06", "ever on an annual basis", "33:09", "more than heroin more than pills more", "33:12", "than math more than crack", "33:14", "and so things just get worse and worse", "33:17", "every year people aren't talking about", "33:19", "it that much but how is", "33:21", "decriminalization going to stop that", "33:22", "because decriminalization will just make", "33:24", "fentanyl more available the point of", "33:28", "legalizing all drugs and again this is a", "33:31", "very very messy subject and I'm not a", "33:33", "proponent of legalizing all drugs I'm", "33:35", "sort of agnostic on and I'm like hmm I", "33:37", "don't know", "33:38", "I don't know what the fuck is it what is", "33:41", "the answer but if you legalize them and", "33:44", "you can buy them from reputable sources", "33:46", "you would know that you're actually", "33:47", "buying cocaine you're not you're not", "33:50", "buying some fake Chinese spice Jamyang", "33:54", "whatever the fuck they call it you're", "33:55", "buying actual cocaine and you look we", "33:58", "know if you buy whiskey right you get a", "34:01", "thing on the label it tells you what", "34:03", "proof it is you know that if you have", "34:05", "yeah you know three drinks you're going", "34:06", "to be fucked up and we can regulate that", "34:08", "we could sort of adjust like I had to", "34:11", "already I'm good you know but if you", "34:14", "don't know what's in it you don't know", "34:15", "what the dose is so you don't know what", "34:17", "you're ok with and what you're not okay", "34:19", "with one of the good things about", "34:21", "alcoholic you get a beer that's a beer", "34:23", "you know what that is yeah you know how", "34:25", "much alcohol is in there yeah well in", "34:28", "some countries in Europe they actually", "34:30", "give free heroin and these are addicted", "34:34", "users yeah and so that you know it's", "34:36", "often not the heroin that kills people", "34:38", "at all it's the dirty needles it's the", "34:41", "criminal lifestyle used to like pay for", "34:44", "the money to buy prostitution things", "34:46", "like that and so I went and visited", "34:49", "these places called supervised injection", "34:51", "facilities have you heard about these", "34:53", "yes yeah where were these where they", "34:56", "have them well they don't have any in", "34:58", "this country is this one in Philadelphia", "35:00", "yeah and there was a court case in its", "35:03", "favor recently the former governor ed", "35:05", "Rendell is like spearheading that but I", "35:08", "went to one in Barcelona and so these", "35:11", "are places where drug use is totally", "35:13", "legal inside the facility they have", "35:15", "clean needles they have doctors and", "35:17", "nurses supervise it and and they even", "35:20", "like so they have like this the smoking", "35:24", "room where you can go and do do anything", "35:26", "you want they", "35:28", "crack pipes like that the government", "35:30", "provides they're like government-funded", "35:31", "and created crack pipes that they'll", "35:34", "hand out to people and they've never had", "35:38", "an overdose death in one of these places", "35:40", "they they have they're connected to", "35:43", "treatment centers they give out", "35:46", "methadone suboxone all these treatment", "35:49", "drugs it brings people into the system", "35:52", "so that they're accounted for and these", "35:55", "have been like super successful but in", "35:58", "the u.s. there's like federal crackdowns", "36:00", "on them you know I again it's I think", "36:05", "there's an issue politically right", "36:06", "because nobody wants to be the one that", "36:08", "says hey we're gonna open up a place", "36:09", "where people can come and shootout yeah", "36:10", "and people like will fuck this guy my", "36:12", "sons hooked on heroin this piece of shit", "36:14", "wants to help him you know we what we", "36:16", "need is detox center so we need his", "36:18", "treatment we don't need a place where", "36:20", "you can go and shoot heroin you know but", "36:23", "like many things in life", "36:25", "this whole heroin thing fentanyl thing", "36:27", "all these different it's very messy yeah", "36:29", "well so even if you're not going to go", "36:32", "that far there are simple steps we can", "36:34", "take to help stop the opioid crisis and", "36:37", "one thing I'm a big advocate for is", "36:39", "called fentanyl testing strips and so", "36:42", "that's the weird thing about fentanyl is", "36:45", "it's not a demand driven drug like every", "36:49", "other drug it's out there because people", "36:50", "want it we want cocaine people want", "36:53", "heroin people don't want fentanyl", "36:54", "sneaking it into other things exactly", "36:56", "and so studies have shown that if users", "36:59", "know fentanyl is in their cocaine or", "37:02", "their math or their heroin or their", "37:03", "pills they will be much less likely to", "37:06", "use it and overdose up from it and so", "37:08", "fentanyl testing strips there they look", "37:11", "kind of like

get China to", "51:30", "stop this insane like 90 percent or more", "51:34", "of the illicit fentanyl comes from China", "51:36", "that if we do get them to crack down on", "51:38", "it the industry

and so they have", "52:22", "this huge kind of brain trust of", "52:25", "chemists you know people go to", "52:27", "university they they learn how to be", "52:28", "chemist and then a certain amount of", "52:30", "them get into the illicit industry right", "52:34", "so Mexico doesn't have that Mexico", "52:37", "doesn't have its own chemical industry", "52:39", "and a bunch of scientists who can make", "52:43", "fentanyl who can make these new drugs so", "52:46", "so that makes India so susceptible to it", "52:51", "and and the biggest problem is actually", "52:53", "not even the fentanyl itself it's the", "52:56", "fentanyl precursors and you know what", "52:59", "those are you know the technicals will", "53:00", "be used to make fentanyl exactly and so", "53:03", "that was sort of the main investigation", "53:05", "in my book like almost like a tea", "53:09", "pages of the book are dedicated to this", "53:10", "one company they're called yuan Chung", "53:14", "this Chinese

it's just the the idea is look it's", "54:00", "making a lot of money let's just keep", "54:02", "making money yeah it's um a lot of", "54:06", "people ask me if they think this is a", "54:08", "blatant conspiracy to try to like", "54:12", "inflict harm upon the US a subversive", "54:15", "form of warfare and so I think it didn't", "54:19", "start out that way I think that these", "54:22",

height", "55:17", "of that China increased the tax rebate", "55:20", "for fentanyl from 9%", "55:23", "to 10% so it was almost like seems like", "55:27", "a thumb in the eye right like for", "55:30",
