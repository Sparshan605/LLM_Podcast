working as a surgeon", "04:40", "when I put people on a ketogenic diet", "04:42", "their joint pain was starting to go away", "04:44", "right this is a pretty common a lot of", "04:46", "people believe that joint pain is", "04:47", "connected to the consumption of simple", "04:49", "carbohydrates well I think it's you know", "04:51", "I find carbohydrates I don't know what", "04:53", "it is for sure but it's something we eat", "04:55", "most like you know a lot of cases not", "04:56", "always but I think there's something out", "04:58", "there we're eating I'm pretty convinced", "05:00", "is not meat you know that's what I can", "05:01", "tell you for sure from what I know you", "05:04", "know whether it's you know sugar whether", "05:06", "it's you know process gluten or wheat or", "05:10", "stuff like that whether it's vegetable", "05:11", "oil whether it's you know or even some", "05:15", "vegetables potentially and so this is", "05:17", "what I'm seeing this is what I saw you", "05:19", "know I studied these large Facebook", "05:21", "groups like an anthropologist you know", "05:22", "like they used to study these people you", "05:24", "know 100 years ago they'd go out you", "05:25", "know Weston Price we've got and see all", "05:27", "these people and study their teeth and", "05:28", "stuff the problem with that is you know", "05:30", "you don't speak their language you know", "05:32", "he's pretty remote you can't you got to", "05:33", "translate and so some of those", "05:35", "observations you know while they're", "05:36", "valid they're hard to do now you know", "05:38", "but so when you're going these groups", "05:39", "and you just was like reading this like", "05:42", "a scientist going okay this guy went on", "05:45", "this diet his joint point away this guy", "05:47", "one of the night and his thyroid disease", "05:49", "went away this guy one on this diet and", "05:51", "his skin got you know psoriasis one I", "05:53", "kept seeing this over and over and over", "05:55", "and over again I mean thousands of them", "05:56", "but the big thing for most people is", "05:58", "removing refined carbohydrates removing", "06:01", "sugar and a lot of people dairy yeah I", "06:04", "would say that that's a good strategy", "06:06", "for most people you know here's the deal", "06:07", "I don't care what people eat whatever", "06:10", "makes you healthy you know I think this", "06:12", "is a thing we have these national", "06:13", "guidelines to tell people to eat but", "06:14", "they're they don't work for most people", "06:16", "you know obviously I mean look look at", "06:18", "our country I mean it's just it's sad to", "06:19", "see all these people that are you know", "06:21", "really really getting sick and so I", "06:23", "think you know there's got in vineet", "06:25", "order to has there's no sugar no grain I", "06:26", "think that well that will successfully", "06:28", "help a huge percentage of people you", "06:31", "know but I think you have to be", "06:32", "objective about it you have to do it", "06:34", "long enough for it to have an effect", "06:35", "and you know I think you have to you", "06:39", "know even be really cool to be really", "06:40", "clinical about it and so one of the big", "06:42", "problems I see as a physician and this", "06:44", "is a big problem because people will go", "06:45", "on low-carb diets or ketogenic diets and", "06:47", "they'll say I feel the best I've ever", "06:50", "felt in my life I mean I my mood is", "06:52", "better my mental cognition is better my", "06:56", "joints feel better my guts don't hurt my", "06:58", "skin is better my sex drive is better", "07:00", "everything you would say is that means", "07:02", "you're getting healthy and they'll go", "07:03", "there doctor they'll get some blood", "07:04", "drawn and their cholesterol be high and", "07:07", "the doctor will say well you're gonna", "07:08", "kill yourself you're gonna have a heart", "07:10", "attack", "07:10", "alright so people get scared away from", "07:12", "that and they go back to eating their", "07:13", "other stuff and then they feel crappy", "07:14", "again but they're like well at least my", "07:15", "cholesterol is not bad so one of the big", "07:17", "problems and I've kind of sort of", "07:19", "basically preaching this stuff as I", "07:21", "think and this is a problem with", "07:23", "healthcare in general is we have so", "07:24", "gotten away from just defining what's", "07:27", "healthy you know if somebody comes into", "07:28", "your office and you say you know you", "07:30", "talk to him for two three minutes cuz", "07:32", "healthcare is just you got ten minutes", "07:34", "to see a patient make a decision so what", "07:36", "you're going to do is like how you doing", "07:37", "or a bunch of labs you look at the", "07:40", "results of the labs and say okay this", "07:42", "labs low this labs high this labs normal", "07:44", "going this drug or you know do this or", "07:47", "that and the patient may be saying what", "07:49", "but I feel great", "07:50", "or maybe converse they may say I feel", "07:52", "like crap well your labs are fine so go", "07:54", "exercise a little bit so let me bring", "07:56", "you back to the beginning so you you're", "07:58", "you're a physician right so you", "07:59", "understand a lot about the human body do", "08:02", "were you worried when you decide to go", "08:04", "on this carnivore only diet were you", "08:06", "worried that you were going to be", "08:07", "deficient in some sort of nutrients and", "08:09", "vitamins and fiber and all these", "08:11", "different things like and were you", "08:13", "cautious yeah I mean I was very very I'm", "08:17", "still skeptical I mean I'm you know", "08:18", "that's just the way he should be but I", "08:20", "mean I was well aware of what's not in", "08:22", "me you know if you look at the RDA you", "08:24", "know look at the RT and it says meat is", "08:26", "low and in vitamin C it's low in", "08:28", "manganese it's low and you know", "08:31", "potassium it's low and you know vitamin", "08:33", "A about of me there's a whole bunch of", "08:34", "things it's low in you know on paper", "08:36", "right so I was like why don't I can't", "08:39", "rectify why these people are doing so", "08:41", "well you know just eating mean and we", "08:43", "know historically that there are there", "08:44", "are populations out there the you know", "08:46", "at the Masai the", "08:47", "Sammy and all these people you know and", "08:49", "anyway it's probably the best example", "08:51", "right because they had an extremely low", "08:53", "incidence of cancer and no vegetables", "08:55", "there's nothing up there yeah I mean I", "08:56", "mean you know if you go to you know if", "08:58", "you go to northern Alaska in the winter", "09:01", "time good luck trying to find a fruit or", "09:03", "vegetable I mean not so but what people", "09:05", "would say when they would they would", "09:06", "just they would justify so yeah but they", "09:07", "ate a lot of their organs and I got some", "09:09", "vitamin C from their liver and you know", "09:11", "some of the some of the whale skiing", "09:13", "handsome so they were just trying to", "09:14", "justify that and try to make this as how", "09:16", "it worked and then the same thing with", "09:17", "Messiah they would say well sometimes", "09:19", "they would eat some berries once in a", "09:20", "while too it always trying to justify", "09:21", "and I'm like you know those things", "09:23", "aren't available year-round so you know", "09:25", "you can't get berries you know", "09:26", "especially in Alaska or wherever the", "09:29", "anyone are you know you can't you can't", "09:30", "get that 12 months out of years well", "09:33", "that's not what's having a significant", "09:34", "impact on their diet I don't think it's", "09:37", "it's coming from the meat itself well", "09:39", "this is this is what this is what I", "09:40", "after doing a lot of research on this", "09:42", "stuff so we've known so it's interesting", "09:44", "so when we look at the development of", "09:46", "the already age you know the recommended", "09:48", "daily allowances those were divided", "09:49", "those were developed back in the 1940s", "09:51", "and they were developed basically for", "09:53", "soldiers to figure out what the heck you", "09:54", "supposed to feed people so they couldn't", "09:56", "survive and so they did research on this", "09:57", "and what they did was they take", "09:59", "populations of people that are consuming", "10:01", "a normal diet like you know back in the", "10:03", "1940s you know people would eat a", "10:04", "mixture everything was fairly high in", "10:06", "carbohydrate not as high as it is now by", "10:08", "the way but it was a mixed diet and so", "10:10", "what they see is you know if you eat", "10:13", "that diet and you're deficient in this", "10:14", "nutrient if you don't get X amount of", "10:16", "this nutrient you're going to develop", "10:17", "some sort of nutrient deficiency", "10:19", "syndrome so they said okay well we know", "10:21", "that this level of nutrient deficiency", "10:24", "causes disease so therefore we're gonna", "10:25", "recommend this you know everybody gets", "10:27", "this amount right so but they knew what", "10:30", "they found out back even in 1897 there's", "10:33", "a study where they're looking at animals", "10:34", "and they looked at something called", "10:35", "thiamine you know what they didn't know", "10:37", "its timing back then but they saw that", "10:38", "certain animals if they're on a lower", "10:40", "carb diet they didn't get this disease", "10:42", "or animals on a high carbohydrate did", "10:45", "get this disease disease was called", "10:47", "beriberi and so that's a thiamine", "10:48", "deficiency which causes neurologic", "10:50", "problems or congestive heart failure", "10:53", "type problems and so they were noticing", "10:55", "that these animals are on a low-carb", "10:56", "diet even though they're fireman levels", "10:58", "were really really low", "10:59", "they weren't getting diseases so if you", "11:02", "look at that and you look at all these", "11:03", "other nutrients you know things like", "11:04", "manganese you know manganese is highly", "11:09", "required for carbohydrate metabolism and", "11:12", "so if you're on a diet where you're not", "11:13", "taking any carbohydrate all of a sudden", "11:16", "you got to say maybe I don't need as", "11:17", "much manganese II despite with the RDA", "11:19", "says and you can look at that for", "11:20", "nutrient after nutrient glucose and", "11:22", "vitamin C is a huge one", "11:24", "all right so vitamin C you don't if you", "11:27", "don't take vitamin C and you get really", "11:30", "really need to get scurvy you get sick", "11:31", "you diamonds they'll kill you I mean you", "11:33", "end up with bleeding in your joints your", "11:35", "teeth fall out your gums rot your skin", "11:37", "opens up with sores horrible disease and", "11:38", "these people are not getting scurvy and", "11:41", "so what's happening is we know that a", "11:43", "molecule of glucose and a molecule of", "11:45", "vitamin C are almost identical and so", "11:47", "they compete for the same transporters", "11:49", "and so if you don't have a lot of", "11:50", "glucose floating around you need way way", "11:52", "less vitamin C really so there's a", "11:55", "newsom and this has been known for quite", "11:57", "a while as well so well that's", "11:58", "fascinating because obviously", "12:00", "orange juice tons of glucose tons of", "12:03", "vitamin C yeah right they basically", "12:04", "cancel each other out and so I think", "12:07", "what's happening and this is one of the", "12:08", "things I think potentially and this", "12:09", "needs to be investigated but I think", "12:12", "that a lot of people that we have all", "12:13", "these vitamin deficiency vitamin D", "12:15", "deficiency magnesium deficiency a lot of", "12:18", "that may be caused by just ingesting too", "12:20", "much carbohydrate and creating and", "12:22", "creating a higher than normal need", "12:23", "so basically we're creating higher needs", "12:26", "for vitamins now you do blood work on", "12:29", "yourself I haven't you know I haven't", "12:30", "yet I'm gonna probably do it once I get", "12:31", "you know I'm a year at this you haven't", "12:34", "done any no I don't you know here's the", "12:36", "deal G I mean I've got a lot of people", "12:37", "to do it all the time I'm not that", "12:39", "interested in it because I just don't I", "12:41", "don't think it makes that big of a", "12:42", "difference for me I'll do it just out of", "12:44", "just to satisfy other people's curiosity", "12:46", "I don't really have that much curiosity", "12:48", "personally about your blood work no", "12:52", "change in your diet where you're just", "12:54", "consuming only meat I would want to see", "12:56", "what kind of results I'm getting well I", "12:57", "mean it depends you know if you can tell", "12:59", "me what blood test tells me I'm healthy", "13:01", "and I don't think you can't well I think", "13:03", "if you get a really good doctor who", "13:05", "understands different genes HDL", "13:06", "cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and free", "13:09", "testosterone

I you know we've", "13:34", "started this you know you know and again", "13:36", "I was I started doing this and got", "13:38", "public on it and Twitter and a lot of", "13:39", "people were saying well yeah you're you", "13:41", "know you're doing well you're you know", "13:43", "I'm breaking some more records and stuff", "13:44", "like that world records you break so so", "13:49", "I'm gonna

I", "29:33", "tell you as I say Joe eating meats bad", "29:35", "for you and you say if you I don't care", "29:38", "I don't care about my health right right", "29:39", "so you just don't care so this is it so", "29:41", "they can't separate that out so they've", "29:43", "got all these studies were they they try", "29:46", "to separate it out and say well what", "29:47", "kind of even up to smokers but they", "29:49", "never can take that I don't give it up", "29:50", "you know I don't know I don't give a", "29:51", "fuck right thing out of it and so you've", "29:54", "got this stuff and then all the studies", "29:55", "are really really low strength so if we", "29:57", "look at you know and we can talk about", "29:59", "this about me being me being a good", "30:01", "causing cancer

risk if your risk of getting colon", "30:29", "cancer is 1 or say your risk of getting", "30:33", "colon cancer is 5 in a million right", "30:39", "uh-huh and now it's 6 in a million I", "30:42",

"30:51", "powerful right there's a problem so it", "30:54", "depends on the incident so if it's", "30:55", "to begin with and you only raised about", "30:57", "a tiny amount it's so small and so what", "30:59", "we know there was a guy named Bradford", "31:01", "Hill we talked about statistical", "31:03", "correlations on when this things", "31:05", "actually matter and not to you get to",

two", "31:17", "it would be six yeah right right so", "31:22", "instead of being 18 percent more likely", "31:24", "you're two hundred percent more likely", "31:25", "those numbers are confusing to people", "31:27", "though the way you're saying that's a", "31:31", "lot of people right so so you would have", "31:33", "to double or triple around your risk so", "31:35", "18 percent is not double or tripling", "31:37", "we're only putting it up backed by a", "31:38", "fraction right right so when you when", "31:40", "you separate all that stuff out and then", "31:42", "you know there was a you know the World", "31:45", "Health Organization two years ago last", "31:47", "year two years ago declared that red", "31:50", "meat was a class two carcinogen to", "31:52", "processed meats was a

them", "33:36", "get cancer really really easy so what", "33:38", "they did is they felt how did they do", "33:39", "that if it trying to find out if", "33:40", "something gives something cancer well", "33:42", "because they want to make it they want", "33:44", "to be a differentiate as quick as", "33:46", "possible this is a real fast way to show", "33:52", "up they get cancer but the problem with", "33:54", "that and she explains it very well is", "33:55", "that we don't know that they would get", "33:57", "cancer it's and it's not shown and the", "33:59", "other thing we talked about this before", "34:00", "is it if you want to look at rat studies", "34:02", "and it's not to say that plants give you", "34:04", "cancer but there are pesticides in", "34:06", "plants that have been studied in rats", "34:08", "that we eat every day natural foods and", "34:10", "vegetables and fruits that also give", "34:12", "rats cancer and so the only difference", "34:14", "is we've got

also", "34:56", "feed them sugar with it you know it's", "34:58", "kind of like it's just a way they do it", "35:01", "you know and so I you know you can", "35:03", "extrapolate does that really matter to", "35:04", "humans or not it's just so hard to tell", "35:06", "and I mean there's so many things that", "35:07", "animals can eat that we can't it's just", "35:09", "the whole thing is bizarre yeah I mean", "35:11", "we're not rats you know that's", "35:12", "interesting you know it's like the same", "35:13", "thing when we talked about you know", "35:15", "cancer rates a new historical population", "35:17", "so you know what massage they didn't", "35:18", "have much cancer you know so we started", "35:20", "feeding them you know the nineteen", "35:21", "forties thirties", "35:22", "stuff like that none so till we started", "35:24", "feeding them all our crap I think that", "35:26", "they started to get those diseases mmm", "35:28", "yeah that's uh it's all very strange", "35:32", "right when you think about diet and and", "35:34", "health you also have to take into", "35:36", "account geographical the the geography", "35:40", "that your ancestors evolved in and what", "35:42", "they what were they accustomed to eating", "35:44", "like there's different adaptations for", "35:46", "the Inuit for example adaptations to", "35:48", "cold they probably have requirements for", "35:51", "certain amount of dietary fat yeah I", "35:54", "think it's you know this is what I think", "35:55", "I think we're all you know this is one", "35:56", "of the things that people talk about", "35:57", "their psyche you know everybody's so", "35:59", "different we have all this different", "36:00", "genetics we all need special diets I", "36:02", "tend to say that you know in certain", "36:05", "circumstances that makes sense but I", "36:06", "think you know evolutionary you know we", "36:09", "we sort of split from primates", "36:11", "you know we shared a common

and so what", "36:21", "happens is you know the human the pre", "36:23", "humans kind of went one way and then the", "36:24", "apes and chimpanzees went up to swing we", "36:27", "know we went up into the trees and if", "36:29", "you look at you know even the difference", "36:31", "between a chimp and I'm in and I'm in an", "36:33", "ape", "36:33", "you know an ape I'm not an ape of", "36:35",

"36:44", "they're they're they're : got a little", "36:46", "smaller well humans Colin's got way way", "36:49", "smaller right", "36:50", "and so what happened is why you and I", "36:51", "can throw a rock really far you know in", "36:54", "the chimpanzee you know a chimpanzee can", "36:55", "throw on you know if you go jim-jams you", "36:57", "a baseball he can throw about 20 miles", "36:58", "an hour it's not very strong you and I", "37:00", "can throw a baseball you know 60 miles", "37:03", "an hour average guy you know if you get", "37:04", "you know major league baseball players", "37:06", "or throwing at 95 plus right the reason", "37:08", "we evolved to do that is because we were", "37:10", "throwing shit at animals we were hunting", "37:12", "right that's what drove I mean our", "37:14", "scapula is rotated you know if you look", "37:17", "at a chimpanzee scapula it's you know on", "37:18", "the side it allows them to crown climb", "37:20", "trees and do this stuff and so these", "37:22", "strong climate based evolutionary", "37:24", "pressures which drove us to saying you", "37:27", "know there's you know you know there's", "37:28", "all this Ice Age stuff going on the the", "37:31", "climb is drawing out the fruits and then", "37:33", "jungles are going away now it's all this", "37:34", "grassland", "37:35", "and you know there's not much eat in the", "37:37", "grassland you know except for some", "37:39", "animals people eat some bugs and stuff", "37:40", "like that for a while and that's what", "37:43", "you know chimpanzees even chimpanzees", "37:44", "you know 3% of their diet", "37:46", "you know there's a lot of people say", "37:47", "we're frugivores and always she gives", "37:49", "fruit but even chimpanzees eat about 3", "37:51", "percent of that comes from killing other", "37:52", "animals I mean there there's this red", "37:54", "colobus monkey somewhere and you can", "37:56", "tour somewhere in Africa the chimpanzees", "37:58", "are hunting this thing to extinction", "37:59", "yeah they're they're good little hunters", "38:01", "but yeah there's a David Attenborough", "38:03", "documentary on it it's terrifying you", "38:06", "see how organized they are to kill", "38:07", "monkeys and they have chimps at one end", "38:10", "of this treeline and they're coming this", "38:13", "way and they have chimps on the side and", "38:14", "they chase them in and then they they", "38:16", "corner them they ambush them they get", "38:17", "them in the centre and they just swarm", "38:19", "them that's amazing I mean it and you", "38:20", "know think about their brain is not even", "38:22", "half as big as ours I mean so in humans", "38:24", "sort of and I think that's I think it's", "38:26", "pretty clear that what drove a lot of", "38:28", "our Evolet evolution our ability to", "38:30", "communicate to strategize and some of", "38:31", "the anatomic things was based around", "38:33", "hunting I mean I think I know you're a", "38:34", "big hunter Jill and I know it's it's not", "38:36", "an easy thing to do you've got to think", "38:38", "a lot you know you've got to be pretty", "38:39", "smart outsmart these animals I'm", "38:41", "supposed to be when you're in big groups", "38:42", "and back then when they've got you know", "38:44", "I got a Spears basically you know you", "38:46", "look at there's a population in Central", "38:49", "Europe called the gravitons right so if", "38:51", "you look at population markers for", "38:54", "nutrition right the one of the things", "38:57", "they look at is population height so if", "38:59", "there's a real topic tall population", "39:01", "means that they had really good", "39:03", "nutrition and so if you look at the", "39:04", "tallest people that probably ever lived", "39:06", "were these Corvette Ian's", "39:07", "these guys just decimating mammoths I", "39:11", "mean they were so efficient at killing", "39:12", "mammoths and so that's probably", "39:13", "basically all they ate you know for the", "39:16", "most part they might have middle", "39:17", "vegetables but there they were their", "39:19", "average height was like 6 foot 2 and", "39:20", "this is like 30 thousand years ago", "39:22", "that's crazy", "39:22", "so these things have been giant there", "39:24", "were giants and so the people that have", "39:25", "sort of genetically are related to those", "39:27", "people now are the people from Croatia", "39:29", "in the Netherlands we're turning into", "39:30", "tallest people in the world the only", "39:31", "yeah other group that rivaled that are", "39:33", "the neurotic", "39:34", "Africans which are like the Watusi and", "39:37", "the Messiah which are all about six feet", "39:39", "tall and average and their diet is", "39:40", "primarily as we know livestock based and", "39:43", "then the other tall population", "39:45", "historically were the Plains Indian", "39:47", "particularly the Cheyenne injury", "39:48", "and they just lived on mostly Buffalo so", "39:51", "it's kind of its kind of interesting as", "39:53", "far as what's the best food for", "39:54", "nutrition you know and you know that's", "39:57", "what I'm finding from a performance", "39:58", "standpoint you know it's just what makes", "40:00", "me feel the best about do you supplement", "40:02", "do you take vitamins or minerals or", "40:04", "anything you know I don't you know I", "40:06", "just you know I kind of you know just", "40:08", "yeah well I will say I take some salt", "40:10", "you know uh salting I mean you know I'll", "40:12", "have some Himalayan salt or some regular", "40:14", "salt how do you normally cook you you", "40:16", "cook for yourself also time yeah I mean", "40:18", "you get pretty good at cooking steaks", "40:19", "yeah so I'll either reverse here you", "40:22", "know you know reverse sear a steak you", "40:25", "cook it slowly like medium rare and then", "40:31", "I throw in the pan for a couple minutes", "40:32", "and sear it up and they need it or less", "40:34", "throw it on the grill you know depends", "40:35", "where I'm where I'm at from California I", "40:37", "got a grill here so I'll throw it on the", "40:39", "grill if I'm back you know another in", "40:40", "New Mexico I'll just I'll do a girl", "40:43", "there so mm-hmm", "40:44", "you know takes she must do a lot of", "40:49", "supermarket runs is that get expensive", "40:51", "it's got to be an expensive diet yeah so", "40:53", "I mean it's you know it depends you know", "40:55", "it depends on you know again how much", "40:56", "I'm probably eating more than yeah the", "40:58", "average person that does this diet that", "40:59", "I'm orab she only goes about two pounds", "41:01", "two pounds of meat and so they can okay", "41:04", "I'm down a day right and so a lot of", "41:05", "people you know people that are that are", "41:07", "you know don't have the budget Elvis to", "41:09", "like ground beef and stuff like that and", "41:10", "you can do you can eat two pounds of", "41:12", "ground beef for you know under ten bucks", "41:13", "a day which is right weight you know", "41:15", "it's 2 cups of Starbucks you know", "41:16", "something like this yeah it's actually", "41:18", "not that bad for a lot of people now", "41:20", "there's also people that have ethical", "41:22", "concerns about the consumption of", "41:24", "animals especially the consumption of", "41:25", "factory farmed animals sir on a mass", "41:28", "basis um you're probably responsible for", "41:30", "a whole goddamn field dead cows yeah so", "41:33", "I mean I think I mean I think I have a", "41:35", "concern I think people that eat meat", "41:36", "should be concerned about and we're the", "41:37", "ones that primarily need to make sure", "41:40", "that's not happening and so I think you", "41:42", "know as you know you know I would argue", "41:44", "that you know since evolution began", "41:47", "humans have been eating meat and that's", "41:49", "just what happens in nature you know if", "41:50", "you look at how an animal is killed in a", "41:52", "wildly if a lion takes down a zebra it's", "41:55", "not a pleasant experience for that", "41:56", "animal and so most of the way that", "41:58", "humans kill these animals now", "42:00", "you know from it from humane say it's", "42:02", "pretty darn humane I'm even as a hunter", "42:03", "you know if you hit an animal you don't", "42:05", "get them you know you don't hit him the", "42:06", "right spot you got to track him down", "42:08", "he's gonna may take an hour yeah so the", "42:12", "issue is not necessarily even just the", "42:14", "eventual death of the animal it's also", "42:16", "real life the end oh yeah I agree with", "42:19", "that so I think that you know you have", "42:22", "to look at you know if the animal is", "42:25", "like if you got chickens and cages and", "42:26", "they can't turn around right and their", "42:28", "business cramped in there that's awful", "42:30", "there shouldn't be a lot one of the", "42:31", "reasons they put chicken in cages", "42:33", "because I'll pick the hell out of each", "42:34", "other you know they don't sever and", "42:35", "they'll just tear each other out so that", "42:37", "you know there are different", "42:38", "considerations on that you know if you", "42:39", "have an animal that you're you know cuz", "42:41", "I talk a lot of cattle ranchers and most", "42:42", "of them I mean most of them they really", "42:45", "care about their animals around the snow", "42:46", "and the rain making sure their animals", "42:48", "are fed making sure they're sheltered", "42:50", "you know if an animal goes down they're", "42:51", "taking care of that so you know there's", "42:53", "probably some bad apples out there and", "42:55", "if we know about that stuff from some", "42:56", "vegan documentary guy wants to make him", "42:58", "film out that then yeah those guys", "43:00", "should be saying hey don't mistreat your", "43:02", "animals you know don't you know", "43:04", "intentionally hurt them don't have them", "43:05", "standing in a pile of crap you know give", "43:07", "them some giving some you know fresh air", "43:09", "and some some ability to move but you", "43:11", "know you know if you look cows or", "43:13", "handles in a while they're hurt animals", "43:15", "anyway so they hang out together anyway", "43:17", "it's not like if they're indoors now if", "43:19", "they're indoors and they've got you know", "43:21", "room to move around and they go in and", "43:22", "go out I don't think that's a big issue", "43:24", "and so I think you have to kind of you", "43:26", "know you can't just make it all black", "43:27", "and white right there's some people that", "43:28", "are good at it some people are bad the", "43:30", "bad ones need to be made not to do that", "43:32", "anymore I mean it doesn't change the", "43:34", "fact we all need to eat there's a", "43:35", "company called butcher box that'll sell", "43:37", "you grass-fed grass-finished beef - they", "43:40", "sent it to you they're one of the", "43:41",

sort of a like a like a", "43:55", "password or something that we give them", "43:57", "to see we could find that but there's", "44:01", "ways to get you mean you have to search", "44:05", "for it though it's not know that you get", "44:07", "you don't really exactly know how the", "44:10", "person is raising it it's it's hard I", "44:12", "mean you mean unless you go to", "44:13", "some sort of a farmers market or", "44:15", "something like that okay you can get $10", "44:18", "off plus free bacon by using the", "44:20", "codeword Rogan at butcher box comm so", "44:23", "butcher box is one option there's I'm", "44:26", "sure there's like I said farmers markets", "44:28", "are great too you can actually meet the", "44:30", "ranchers and you know get a sense of how", "44:33", "they raise these animals but I think for", "44:35", "health-wise it's really critical to get", "44:37", "grass fed grass raised to get the best", "44:39", "do you pay attention to that or do you", "44:42", "just take whatever you can get yeah so I", "44:44", "think I think you know I think you're", "44:46", "right in the fact that if you say what", "44:47", "is the most nutrient dense what is the", "44:51", "best quality I can get in grass-fed", "44:53", "grass-finished it's going to fill that", "44:55", "bill now if you compare that to", "44:57", "something that was you know fed corn", "44:59", "right and given hormones and given", "45:01", "antibiotics and what else do they do you", "45:04", "know so you know you've got those things", "45:06", "and it's fed you know grain the", "45:08", "difference nutritionally compared to you", "45:11", "know because you don't have any money", "45:12", "and you can't afford this young compared", "45:14", "to the rest of the crap in the", "45:15", "supermarket is you know so so I'll use", "45:18", "it I'll use a MMA and algae for you so", "45:20", "if grass-fed and grain-fed beef is you", "45:22", "know Conor McGregor or GSP right then", "45:26", "this other stuff is say some guy who's", "45:28", "like the number three contender or", "45:29", "something like that really it's that", "45:30", "that close the difference isn't you know", "45:32", "because you look at hormones and beef", "45:34", "you know so you don't even or most in", "45:35", "your meeting right right you don't want", "45:37", "antibiotics in your meeting either right", "45:38", "so you're in your grass-fed even though", "45:41", "the elk you kill you've got hormones and", "45:43", "that stuff because the animal makes it", "45:44", "now over horse so you're getting a", "45:46", "little harder getting some very low", "45:48", "level and so what they do is they give", "45:49", "those animals generally the same", "45:52", "hormones it increases the percentage a", "45:54", "little bit more compared to what you and", "45:56", "I make normally so if they if we look at", "45:58", "like nanograms you know maybe I can't", "46:01", "remember numbers exactly but the scale", "46:03", "is what's important so if they give you", "46:05", "if grass-fed beef gives you five", "46:07", "nanograms of estrogen okay green fed", "46:11", "beef gives you 10 nanograms of estrogen", "46:13", "and then you compare it to eggs which", "46:16", "give you maybe 90 and you compare it to", "46:19", "Dairy which gives you 110 and then you", "46:21", "compare it to you know if you look at", "46:24", "phytoestrogens you know that's a know", "46:26", "that's an", "46:27", "millions right so things like soybeans", "46:29", "and stuff like that and then you compare", "46:31", "it to what does your body naturally make", "46:32", "and that's like thirty or forty thousand", "46:35", "and so it's a really small level so I", "46:37", "think if you can afford grass-fed and", "46:39", "grain-fed you know I'm not saying how", "46:42", "can you solve the world's problems I", "46:43", "think if you're just - if we just", "46:44", "isolate for health only say you're a", "46:46", "poor guy and all you can afford is you", "46:49", "know I can't afford this grasp it mean I", "46:51", "can't for 20 bucks a pound for this", "46:52", "stuff right in butcher box is still too", "46:54", "expensive for me then that's probably", "46:56", "still a better option than going back", "46:58", "and eating you know the other crap gonna", "47:01", "crow the Cheetos and the you know all", "47:04", "this other stuff and even though you", "47:05", "like the organic fruits and stuff like", "47:07", "that you know it's just expensive for", "47:08", "people so I mean I think it's you know", "47:10", "like I said it depends on who your", "47:11", "audience is you know if you've got", "47:12", "unlimited resources and most people", "47:15", "don't then you have to say what's you", "47:17", "know what's you know from a health", "47:19", "standpoint what is most affordable and", "47:22", "what's practical how do I get my health", "47:23", "back because this is you know I don't", "47:25", "like I said I don't really I'm not like", "47:27", "saying this is the best diet in the", "47:28", "world for everybody I'm just saying you", "47:29", "need to find out what works for you", "47:31", "right ways who are saying is that", "47:32", "grass-fed beef is better but it's only", "47:35", "slightly better for you right I mean in", "47:37", "the grand scheme of things right so if", "47:39", "you're saying I want to be as good as I", "47:41", "possibly can be and then I said probably", "47:42", "grass-fed grain fit on the craftsman is", "47:44", "probably better if you're like saying", "47:46", "I'm just sick and I don't want to be", "47:47", "sick anymore then I'd say get what you", "47:49", "can afford so you really think that meat", "47:51", "is in some ways a panacea for health you", "47:54", "think that it really if you just eat", "47:56", "more meat that your body will be what", "47:59", "more vibrant more healthy like what is", "48:01", "what is it about meat specifically well", "48:04", "I think it's you know so this is another", "48:05", "sort of misconception so I think a lot", "48:07", "of P it's extremely well absorbed in our", "48:10", "body I mean it's look at the end result", "48:12", "of why we what do we do when we when", "48:14", "we're eating okay", "48:14", "what's the end result we eat for two", "48:16", "reasons we eat to get energy and to", "48:19", "build animal tissue I mean you and I are", "48:21", "animals right animal tissue the most", "48:23", "efficient way to do that is just to eat", "48:26", "some because your body has it has it", "48:27", "says everything and then the proportions", "48:29", "that we need it right right and it's you", "48:31", "know it's a misconception you know when", "48:33", "you hear a lot of people will say you", "48:35", "know if you get to meet a bunch of me", "48:36", "just gonna sit there and rot and your", "48:38", "intestines it's gonna purify and stuff", "48:40", "like that", "48:41", "so they've done Studies on people who", "48:44", "have had ileostomy x' and these are", "48:45", "people that have had their colon removed", "48:46", "right so you've had colon cancer you", "48:49", "know inflammatory bowel disease like", "48:51", "Crohn's disease where they take out your", "48:53", "whole cold and now you got a little back", "48:54", "which you poop into this little bag", "48:56", "right yeah so they've looked at people", "48:57", "and they've looked at what comes out", "48:59", "when they eat meat almost nothing comes", "49:01", "out there's a little bit of liquid right", "49:03", "so that means all that meat is being", "49:05", "absorbed you know but when you eat a", "49:07", "bunch of fiber and vegetables and plants", "49:08", "all that stuff goes up in the back cuz", "49:11", "you can't digest it you got to have you", "49:12", "have to have bacteria in your colon to", "49:14", "do that and humans are not really good", "49:16", "at it compared to other primates we're", "49:17", "really bad at it", "49:18", "what about probiotics so I think", "49:20", "probiotics you know the microbiome is", "49:24", "fascinating and there's a lot of", "49:26", "research going on there's a lot of", "49:27", "people just talking all about this stuff", "49:28", "how it affects your health one of the", "49:30", "things that we we try to say is how do", "49:32", "we define a healthy microbiome you can't", "49:35", "yet we just don't know enough there are", "49:36", "you know we can't even we don't even", "49:38", "know everything about the human body and", "49:39", "then to put in tens of billions of", "49:42", "different bacteria all different", "49:43", "different species and say this is the", "49:45", "perfect combination that's perfect we're", "49:47", "so far away from knowing that we're in", "49:49", "the very infancy of what that means so", "49:51", "what I would say is if you're healthy", "49:53", "you know if your joints don't hurt if", "49:56", "everything's going good then probably by", "49:58", "definition your microbiome is fine if", "50:00", "you're eating just a meat based that", "50:02", "your microphone is gonna be different in", "50:03", "the probiotic so probably not going to", "50:04", "make a difference for you but if you're", "50:06", "eating yeah if you're getting a crappy", "50:07", "diet you know and you're feeding your", "50:09", "got a bunch of sugar you're gonna get", "50:11", "this dysbiosis which is bad you know bad", "50:14", "bacteria and then you know maybe the", "50:18", "private probiotics might help in that", "50:20", "situation I'm not convinced you know I", "50:21", "don't I just I just don't think there's", "50:23", "a you know enough evidence to show that", "50:25", "that's a big deal that's interesting so", "50:27", "you think that perhaps maybe the", "50:28", "probiotics exist or maybe the probiotics", "50:30", "are healthy", "50:33", "freaking out audio levels yeah too loud", "50:39", "no no no separate so the probiotics you", "50:43", "think maybe only beneficial of people", "50:47", "are consuming a lot of variable things", "50:50", "are a very diet like carbohydrates all", "50:52", "sorts of different things and maybe the", "50:54", "the probiotics are necessary to sort of", "50:57", "balance you out is that what you're", "50:58", "thinking", "50:58", "I mean that potentially could be the", "51:00", "case so you think that the microbiome of", "51:01", "someone who eats meat is probably", "51:03", "designed to eat meat well it is I mean I", "51:06", "you your your microbiome reacts to", "51:08", "whatever you do how much sleep you get", "51:10", "how much exercise you know how much you", "51:12", "eat you know how much stress is in your", "51:13", "life is very very adaptable it can", "51:15", "change in a day right you know so", "51:17", "whatever you're feeding it chronically", "51:18", "is gonna change what wouldn't like what", "51:19", "bacteria live there so you know it's", "51:22", "like this thing about you know again", "51:23", "back to this meat putrefaction thing so", "51:25", "if we look at the definition of", "51:27", "putrefaction you know sounds awful right", "51:28", "it's putrifying right putrefaction is", "51:31", "the act area of bacteria on protein", "51:33", "right so protein gets in your colon", "51:35", "it'll appear to fry right so again when", "51:38", "we go back to these ileostomy patients", "51:40", "they study people that were getting soy", "51:41", "protein and meat and guess which one had", "51:44", "more protein going into the colon", "51:46", "soy protein yeah so meeting about the", "51:50", "soybeans stuff means more proteins going", "51:52", "into your colon and you're getting more", "51:53", "future facts in that way is that rumor", "51:55", "like I know very little about what so I", "51:58", "supposed to do to you in terms of like", "52:00", "raising your estrogen levels is that", "52:03", "supposed to be a real thing well I mean", "52:05", "there's a lot of people think so", "52:06", "I mean there's some studies that support", "52:07", "that I don't know for sure I mean I", "52:09", "don't I don't think so is a particularly", "52:10", "good food for us I know some people will", "52:12", "say that fermented soy you know is a", "52:15", "little better", "52:15", "yeah right that's good for you actually", "52:17", "right they called not to not oh yeah I", "52:19", "think it's an Asian type thing yeah you", "52:21", "know I think that you know there's", "52:22", "certainly some people that I think", "52:25", "there's a lot of associations guys", "52:26", "getting gynecomastia and stuff like that", "52:28", "for meeting too much soy guys really", "52:30", "done that I feel like that's one of", "52:31", "those things where people just tell you", "52:33", "you bitch tits you know I've got no idea", "52:35", "guys getting that from anything other", "52:37", "than steroids yeah I mean they're", "52:39", "they're they're suppose we are I don't", "52:41", "know for sure you can't say I can't say", "52:42", "for sure entire yeah so", "52:46", "now that you've been doing this do you", "52:48", "plan on you've done it for a year now do", "52:50", "you plan on continuing this for life is", "52:52", "this your diet now are you gonna mix it", "52:54", "up a little like right so I'm gonna you", "52:56", "know I seriously doubt I will not eat a", "52:58", "ton of meat you know I just think I feel", "53:00", "- good I mean I think I want to feel", "53:01", "good and perform as good as I can for as", "53:03", "long as I can so whether I say and this", "53:06", "is what I tell people you know do it for", "53:08", "a couple months it's you know because", "53:10", "this is one of the problems so many", "53:11", "people have health problems and I think", "53:12", "a lot of its food-related and it's", "53:13", "really hard to sort that out you know if", "53:15", "you're eating a hundred different types", "53:17", "of food which one is I don't know I'm", "53:19", "going to I'm going to drop this out", "53:21", "right right so and it's obviously", "53:23", "variable in terms of like your own", "53:25", "individual by alright right so but I", "53:27", "mean when you drop that and just meat", "53:29", "then it's pretty easy you just say okay", "53:31", "I'm only meeting now if I add fruit back", "53:32", "in does that F me up or not you know if", "53:35", "it does and I'm like man I shouldn't", "53:37", "probably eat that right now if a dairy", "53:38", "back in so probably there will be a", "53:40", "point when I'll say hey I'm me you know", "53:43", "maybe once well I have a you know have", "53:46", "some berries again you know and then", "53:47", "just see how I do with that I mean", "53:49", "there's nothing wrong with that there", "53:50", "are a lot of people I'll tell you that", "53:52", "so these guys have been doing it for", "53:53", "five eight 10 15 years I mean they're", "53:56", "like me and that stuff - the best screws", "53:57", "me up and I don't want to do that who", "53:58", "was the guy that you were saying did you", "53:59", "find that gentleman online young Jeremy", "54:02", "the did you get the tab the guard that", "54:08", "he was saying Anderson I couldn't", "54:10", "actually couldn't find him that was can", "54:12", "you go on if you go on my Instagram", "54:14", "there is about no about a month or two", "54:18", "ago I've got a picture I put up four of", "54:21", "these people these are all people that", "54:22", "have done it for total of 55 years okay", "54:24", "and there's one guy as a marathon runner", "54:26", "and then these other two couple have", "54:28", "been doing it for twenty years another", "54:29", "gal there's nothing gouging Kelly Hogan", "54:31", "that she was like big morbidly obese", "54:34", "woman and she went on a car virgin she's", "54:37", "not for eight years and she got super", "54:39", "lean she was - totally infertile", "54:41", "couldn't have kids all right super lean", "54:43", "carnivore got three

think whatever works is what you", "55:20", "should do well I think that the removal", "55:22", "of refined carbohydrates almost helps", "55:26", "everybody know I agree if not the", "55:29", "removal the severe restriction just", "55:33", "restrict most car I mean I think a day a", "55:35", "week just have at it you have a fucking", "55:37", "slice of pizza who gives a shit", "55:38", "go to town I don't think there's", "55:40", "anything wrong with a cheat day but I", "55:42", "think overall refined carbohydrates just", "55:45", "do not seem to be a healthy nor normal", "55:48", "thing for your body to consume well if", "55:50", "we look at you know historically I mean", "55:52", "you know we didn't start consuming dairy", "55:54", "until about 12,000 years going to start", "55:56", "farming till about the same time so", "55:58", "those things are in relatively novel you", "56:00", "know we didn't start eating all this", "56:01", "processed stuff fell about 100 you know", "56:03", "Crisco came out in 1910 or something", "56:05", "like this all that crap we've been", "56:06", "invented in the last century and then", "56:08", "when high fructose corn syrup came in in", "56:09", "the 70s all that stuff our human body", "56:12", "just hasn't evolved for yet so I think", "56:13", "we're getting we're getting seriously", "56:15", "messed up that stuff yeah and if you", "56:17", "look at the change in our diet there's a", "56:19", "corresponding uptick and diabetes and", "56:21", "all sorts of other obesity factors and", "56:23", "health issues sugar and refined", "56:26", "carbohydrate still the two big ones", "56:28", "though the other debate is whether or", "56:30", "not eating all this meat is healthy for", "56:32", "you and what about diverticulitis have", "56:33", "you ever heard about people getting next", "56:35", "I know that's what Brock Lesnar got and", "56:38", "one of the things that they said that he", "56:39", "got it from just eating mostly meat yeah", "56:41", "this is interesting because there's", "56:42", "actually got imperii PE are wide to", "56:45", "study 2014 he did colonoscopies right so", "56:49", "he actually looked in people it was one", "56:50", "of the first ones to do this and he", "56:51", "looked at people on these diets and he", "56:53", "found that the people that ate the", "56:54", "highest amount of fiber and had the most", "56:57", "bowel movements had the most incidents", "56:59", "of diverticulosis so diverticulosis", "57:01", "precedes diverticulitis so a diverticula", "57:04", "is just a little pouch that shoots out", "57:05", "from your colon it looks like a little", "57:07", "sack so what happens is that eventually", "57:08", "gets infected then you get", "57:09", "diverticulitis some people that were", "57:12", "developing diverticulosis and most in", "57:14", "his study he did two or three like this", "57:16", "show the ones are reading a bunch of", "57:18", "fiber and there's also studies on so", "57:20", "that fiber gets caught or some things", "57:21", "that potentially so the question is what", "57:23", "other thing people don't understand you", "57:24", "know because a lot of people when they", "57:25", "talk about ketogenic diets and they cut", "57:28", "out their fiber they're like you're", "57:29", "gonna get all constipated right I mean", "57:31", "you know I saw basically I haven't had a", "57:32", "bowel movement in a year you know it's", "57:33", "gone yeah it's not true obviously but so", "57:36", "what happens is you just don't make", "57:38", "anything I mean you you know all that", "57:39", "meat it goes right into your small", "57:41", "intestines absorb some next to nothing", "57:43", "gets to your colon and so really", "57:45", "anything you take

right and they hand", "82:57", "this report it says all this bad stuff", "82:59", "and they hand my confession right and", "83:01", "this is all I had this is basically what", "83:02", "they have to
