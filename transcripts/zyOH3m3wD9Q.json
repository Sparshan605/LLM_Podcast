I'm a discerning adults", "05:21", "I'm pretty rational and I can figure out", "05:23", "what's real it's nonsense but I don't", "05:25", "look at the political spectrum of people", "05:27", "when I'm looking at their to write you", "05:28", "you have a bio they are you're biased", "05:30", "and you're you're targeting specific", "05:32", "individuals because your rules support", "05:34", "this perspective no well so can you be", "05:37", "clear though and like what rules support", "05:39", "that prism specifically the the easiest", "05:41", "one is misgendering right because that's", "05:42", "so clearly ideological if you ask a", "05:44", "conservative what is misgendering", "05:47", "they'll say if someone is biologically", "05:48", "male and you call them you know", "05:52", "a biology man you called a machine", "05:53", "that's miss gender as a conservative", "05:55", "view the the the progressive view is", "05:57", "inverted so now you actually have in", "05:59", "your policies a a rule against the", "06:02", "conservative perspective I have a rule", "06:04", "against the abuse and harassment of", "06:06", "trans people on our platform that's what", "06:09", "my rules we just give context in the", "06:10", "background of why that is and I brought", "06:13", "some some research so we obviously", "06:15", "received a lot of feedback so we don't", "06:18", "make these rules in a vacuum it just to", "06:19", "be clear we have a bunch of people all", "06:22", "around the world who give us context and", "06:23", "the types of behavior they're seeing how", "06:25", "that translates into real-world harm and", "06:27", "they give us feedback and they tell us", "06:29", "like you should consider different types", "06:31", "of rules different types of perspectives", "06:34", "different like for example when we try", "06:36", "to enforce hey", "06:36", "we'll conduct in our hateful conduct", "06:38", "policy in a particular country we're not", "06:40", "going to know all the slur words that", "06:42", "are used to target people of a", "06:43", "particular race or a particular religion", "06:46", "so we're going to rely on building out a", "06:48", "team of experts all around the world who", "06:51", "are going to help us enforce our rules", "06:52", "so in the particular case of", "06:55", "misgendering I'm just trying to pull up", "06:56", "some of the studies that we looked at", "06:58", "but we looked at the American", "07:01", "Association of Pediatrics and looked at", "07:03", "the number of transgender youths that", "07:05", "were committing suicide it's an", "07:07", "astronomical I'm sorry I can't find it", "07:09", "right now in front of me it's a really", "07:10", "really high statistic that's like 10", "07:11", "times what the normal suicide rate is of", "07:13", "normal teenagers and we looked at the", "07:16", "causes of what that was happening and a", "07:17", "lot of it was not just violence towards", "07:19", "those individuals but it was bullying", "07:21", "behavior and what was what were those", "07:24", "bullying behaviors that were", "07:25", "contributing to that and that's why we", "07:27", "made this rule because we thought and we", "07:29", "believed that those types of behaviors", "07:32", "were happening on our platform and we", "07:35", "wanted to stop it now there are", "07:36", "exceptions to this rule we don't and", "07:38", "this is all it this isn't about like", "07:40", "public figures and there's always gonna", "07:41", "be public figures that you're gonna want", "07:43", "to talk about and that's that's fine but", "07:45", "this is about are you doing something", "07:47", "with the intention of abusing and", "07:48", "harassing a trans person on a platform", "07:50", "and are they viewing it that way and", "07:52", "reporting it to us so that we take", "07:54", "action so so I will just state I", "07:57", "actually agree with the rule I'm from", "07:59", "you know my point of view I agree that", "08:00", "bullying and harassing trans people is", "08:02", "entirely entirely wrong I disagree with", "08:04", "it but I just want to make sure it's", "08:06", "clear to everybody who's listening my", "08:07", "point is simply that you know ben", "08:08", "shapiro went on a talk show and", "08:10", "absolutely refused and that's his shit", "08:13", "you know and he's one of the biggest", "08:14", "podcasts in the world so if you have all", "08:17", "of his millions upon millions of", "08:19", "followers who are looking at this rule", "08:20", "saying this goes against my view of the", "08:22", "world and it's it's literally 60 plus", "08:24", "million in this country you do have a", "08:26", "rule that's ideologically bent and and", "08:27", "it's it's true you you did the research", "08:29", "you believe this well then you have Ben", "08:32", "Shapiro who did his research and doesn't", "08:33", "believe it yeah and I relied on the", "08:35", "American Association of Pediatrics and", "08:37", "you know Human Rights Council another", "08:40", "and I'm sure he has his sources too for", "08:41", "when he gives his statements the point", "08:43", "is but at least wonder if they have that", "08:45", "context I mean that's and that's where", "08:48", "we have also fits it's as well as", "08:50", "just explaining the why behind a lot of", "08:52", "our eyeballs hidden reasons I I would", "08:54", "agree and I think it's fine you did", "08:56", "research and you found this to be true", "08:57", "but we can't simply say maybe ben", "09:00", "shapiro and the other conservatives who", "09:01", "feel this way don't know we have to we", "09:03", "can't you know the point I'm trying to", "09:05", "make is it's it's simply whether you", "09:07", "believe it what whether you justify it", "09:08", "or not is not the point the point is you", "09:10", "do you do have this rule that rule is at", "09:12", "odds with conservatives period well I", "09:13", "think I think that you're you're", "09:15", "generalizing but I think it is really", "09:17", "important as Jack said to the why behind", "09:19", "these things the why is to protect", "09:21", "people from abuse and harassment on our", "09:23", "pot I understand but you essentially", "09:25", "created a protected class if this is the", "09:27", "case because despite these studies and", "09:30", "what you know these studies are showing", "09:32", "there's a gigantic suicide rate amongst", "09:36", "trans people period it's a forty percent", "09:39", "it's it's outrageously large now whether", "09:42", "that is because of gender dysphoria with", "09:44", "us because of the complications from", "09:47", "sexual surgery sexual transition surgery", "09:50", "whether it's because of bullying whether", "09:52", "it's because of this awful feeling of", "09:53", "being born in the wrong gender whether", "09:55", "that all that is yet to be determined", "09:57", "the fact that they've shown that there's", "10:00", "a large amount of trans people that are", "10:02", "committing suicide I don't necessarily", "10:04", "think that that makes that makes sense", "10:08", "in terms of people from someone's", "10:11", "perspective like a Ben Shapiro saying", "10:13", "that if you are biologically female if", "10:16", "you were born with a double X chromosome", "10:19", "you will never be XY if he says that", "10:23", "that's that's a violation of your policy", "10:26", "and this is you're creating a protected", "10:29", "class to be to be fair targeted express", "10:35", "that opinion so it's easily entitled to", "10:37", "express that opinion you know our bodies", "10:39", "will be living differently in a world", "10:42", "that's two degrees warmer than they are", "10:43", "today", "10:44", "we can't really predict what those", "10:45", "impacts will be but they could be quite", "10:47", "dramatic and they could be things that", "10:49", "we can't even imagine today because", "10:50", "they're you know by some counts millions", "10:53", "of bacteria inside us that we haven't", "10:55", "even identified yet Jesus Christ you're", "10:58", "freaking me out David god damn it it's a", "11:01", "crazy world out there well not just", "11:03", "crazy but", "11:04", "it seems like when you're talking about", "11:07", "things like this when you're talking", "11:08", "about climate change affecting our", "11:10", "actual gut parasites or gut biome and", "11:13", "that this literally could change the way", "11:14", "human beings behave I mean these are all", "11:18", "things that I've never heard discussed", "11:19", "and it it just it's really terrifying", "11:22", "really is you know I mean and part of", "11:25", "the problem is people here like I'll", "11:27", "relax everything's fine", "11:28", "this is this constant thing that we do", "11:31", "where if it's not affecting us currently", "11:34", "right now in the moment it's not a fire", "11:36", "in front of us we don't worry about it", "11:38", "it's a weird compartment", "11:40", "compartmentalization thing that human", "11:42", "beings do yeah and it's you know we you", "11:47", "think that evolution would have trained", "11:48", "us differently you think that evolution", "11:50", "would have trained us over time to have", "11:52", "at least some long-term capacity and I", "11:55", "guess we do have some long-term planning", "11:56", "capacity but it's we choose to think in", "11:59", "really short term way is just about all", "12:01", "the time if people don't understand they", "12:03", "think just because someone doesn't have", "12:04", "the best vocabulary or because they", "12:06", "don't have a comprehensive education", "12:08", "that they're not intelligent that's a", "12:11", "big mistake", "12:12", "no person's intelligent I remember going", "12:16", "to the Catskills when I was I won the", "12:18", "World Junior Championships in Santo", "12:20", "Domingo Dominican Republic and I", "12:23", "remember that American team was saying", "12:25", "oh wow you never fought the best Maya in", "12:28", "fact the best", "12:28", "I thought Americans had the best team", "12:30", "yeah but one guy is like taking plans", "12:33", "and his manager don't like taking plans", "12:35", "either so I'm like who's that and he", "12:37", "told me was Mike Tyson custom model", "12:39", "so me and my trainer we left Canada and", "12:42", "we drove all the way up there and while", "12:45", "we were up there I erase the Radek

me about", "13:05", "each fighter like he studied them and", "13:08", "then you know this is where he got his", "13:11", "old star is his style of fighting from", "13:13", "and first day in the

power but", "13:26", "the first day was really hectic and then", "13:28", "the second day was lactic and that got", "13:30", "better as it went along and the last day", "13:33", "is I got actually the better of him the", "13:35", "last day and I remember custom Allah's", "13:37", "saying Mike you gotta meet him someday", "13:40", "don't you do that and not always echoed", "13:43", "in my mind that will we ever fight will", "13:46", "we ever fight cuz cus D'Amato said that", "13:48", "we're gonna fight well and it did happen", "13:50", "and there's footage of it Wow Lennox has", "13:54", "the
