find a new one you know", "06:32", "and then they can slide right into that", "06:34", "new one and all sudden they feel", "06:35", "energized and they wake up in the", "06:36", "morning instead of

what if what we were talking about", "07:05", "before the podcast by a small select", "07:07", "group of people it's a very small but", "07:10", "vocal minority that wants to", "07:12", "misrepresent you you know and then", "07:14", "there's the periphery that listen to", "07:17", "this small group and then they sort of", "07:19", "parrot those words out without any real", "07:21", "thinking about what you've said well you", "07:23", "know one of the things that I have made", "07:25", "a mistake about in the past that I just", "07:27", "realized in the last couple of weeks was", "07:29", "that you know people often accused me", "07:32", "and they say well most of the people", "07:33", "that listen to you or men and I think", "07:35", "you know when you're accused like that", "07:37", "your automatic response is well you", "07:39", "wouldn't be accused if you weren't doing", "07:41", "something wrong so there must be", "07:42", "something wrong about that's like why", "07:43", "isn't it 50% women and so I've said", "07:45", "things like well you know 80 percent of", "07:48", "the people who watch youtube videos are", "07:49", "men and so the fact that 80 percent of", "07:51", "the people who watch my videos are men", "07:54", "isn't that surprising given that base", "07:56", "rate but then about three weeks ago I", "07:58", "started thinking what what the hell am i", "08:00", "doing it's like what is there something", "08:02", "wrong with talking to man it's not", "08:03", "actually a problem it's like I'm trying", "08:05", "to I'm trying to I mean I didn't set out", "08:07", "to do that specifically but if that's", "08:09", "the way it's working out and and there", "08:11", "is a majority of men coming to my shows", "08:13", "say then is that why is that", "08:16", "all of a sudden supposed to be a bad", "08:18", "thing I'm asking men to you know to be", "08:21", "more honest and especially in their", "08:24", "speech and their thinking and to be more",

life", "08:34", "and putting those two things together", "08:36", "conceptually and it's like and then", "08:38", "there's an accusation about that as if", "08:39", "there's something wrong and I thought", "08:41", "why am I even playing into this it's", "08:43", "like fine I'm talking to men I'm", "08:45", "encouraging them and I am absolutely", "08:47", "thrilled like every time someone comes", "08:49", "up to me and that's happening I may be a", "08:53", "hundred times", "08:53", "a week or something like that and tells", "08:55", "me one of these stories about how they", "08:57", "put their life together it's like I'm", "08:59", "absolutely thrilled about that and so I", "09:01", "don't see it's just a sign of how", "09:05", "pathological our times have become in", "09:07", "some sense that there would have been", "09:08", "any guilt about that to begin with", "09:10", "because how is that not a good thing man", "09:12", "it's weird I think a lot of that has to", "09:15", "do with this concept that men are", "09:17", "running everything and that men have", "09:19", "this massive advantage there's a white", "09:21", "male advantage and privilege that we all",

were", "09:34", "really a good person you would be", "09:36", "looking out he would be trying to", "09:38", "balance that out yeah you wouldn't be", "09:40", "trying to pump up the winning team well", "09:44", "that's it that's part of that narrative", "09:46", "that well if there's winners there there", "09:48", "has to be losers and the reason that", "09:50", "there are losers is because there's", "09:51", "winners and that's complete bloody", "09:53", "nonsense because as far as I'm concerned", "09:55", "that and I really believe this is that", "09:57", "every single person who sets out to put", "10:00", "themselves together ethically is a net", "10:02", "positive to everyone around them there's", "10:04", "no downside of that you know and my book", "10:07", "has been criticized by people who've", "10:08", "read it very poorly especially chapter", "10:10", "one when I talk about hierarchies that", "10:12", "I'm somehow supporting the idea that", "10:16", "power in a hierarchy is the right way to", "10:19", "be and that's there's absolutely nothing", "10:21", "and what I've written that suggests that", "10:22", "at all like I'm suggesting that human", "10:24", "hierarchies are very complex and that", "10:26", "the way that you win in a human", "10:29", "hierarchy is by being competent and", "10:31", "reciprocal and so and so I mean for", "10:34", "example even if you're selfish let's say", "10:37", "you got to think very carefully about", "10:39", "what that would mean if you were selfish", "10:40", "and awake because you have to work to", "10:44", "take care of yourself and what you want", "10:45", "say in this moment but then there's you", "10:48", "tomorrow and there's you next week and", "10:50", "there's you next month the next year and", "10:52", "ten years from now and when you're old", "10:54", "so because you're self-conscious and", "10:56", "because you're aware of the future", "10:58", "you're actually a community unto", "10:59", "yourself and if you're selfish and", "11:02", "impulsive all that means is that you're", "11:03", "serving the person you are right now you", "11:06", "know in that", "11:07", "pulse of way but not the person you're", "11:09", "going to be and so that's not a good", "11:10", "grounds for any sort of ethical behavior", "11:12", "and I see that if you serve yourself", "11:15", "properly there's no difference between", "11:17", "that and serving your family properly", "11:18", "and serving your community properly that", "11:20", "those things all mesh in a kind of a", "11:22", "harmonious manner and one of the things", "11:25", "that's really being effective in the", "11:26", "lecture tour is a discussion about that", "11:29", "idea and its relationship between the", "11:32", "relationship between that and meaning", "11:34", "and responsibility because one of the", "11:36", "things that strikes the audience is", "11:39", "silent constantly because I'm always", "11:41", "listening to them to see you know when", "11:42", "when the attention is maximally focused", "11:44", "is whenever I point out to people that", "11:46", "the antidote to the meaninglessness of", "11:49", "their life and the suffering and the", "11:51", "malevolence that they might be", "11:52", "displaying because they're resentful and", "11:54", "bitter about how things have turned out", "11:56", "that a dote to that is to take on more", "11:58", "responsibility for themselves and for", "12:00", "other people and that that's", "12:01", "aspirational which is kind of cool you", "12:04", "know the conservative types the duty", "12:06", "types and I'm not complaining about them", "12:08", "you know that they're always basically", "12:10", "saying well this is how you should act", "12:12", "because in some sense that's your duty", "12:15", "right that's how a good citizen would", "12:16", "act and that's a reasonable argument but", "12:18", "the case that I've been making is more", "12:20", "that well there is a there is value", "12:23", "distinctions between things some things", "12:26", "are worth doing and some things aren't", "12:28", "and you can kind of discover what that", "12:29", "is for yourself and then you should aim", "12:31", "at the things that are most worth doing", "12:33", "and what you'll find if you watch", "12:35", "carefully is that the things that you", "12:38", "find worth doing are almost always", "12:40", "associated with an increase in", "12:42", "responsibility because if you think", "12:44", "about the people you admire for example", "12:46", "you spontaneously admire people and", "12:48", "that's a manifestation of the instinct", "12:50", "to imitate again people are very", "12:52", "imitative you don't admire people who", "12:54", "don't take care of themselves like", "12:56", "unless there's something wrong with you", "12:57", "you you at least want an admirable", "12:59", "person to be accountable for themselves", "13:02", "and then if they've got something left", "13:03", "over so they can be accountable for", "13:05", "their family well then that's a net plus", "13:07", "obviously that's someone you think is", "13:09", "solid and then maybe they take care of", "13:11", "some more people they have a business or", "13:12", "they're involved in the community in", "13:14", "some positive way you see well that's a", "13:16", "person whose pattern of being is worth", "13:18", "imitating and so and that's all", "13:21", "associated with responsibility and it's", "13:23", "so interesting because it's as if it's", "13:25", "as if everybody kind of knows this but", "13:28", "that it hasn't crystallized it's like", "13:30", "well you should be responsible because", "13:32", "that's what a good citizen is it's not", "13:34", "no no you should be responsible because", "13:36", "you need to have a deep meaning in your", "13:38", "life to offset the suffering so you", "13:39", "don't get bitter and the way you do that", "13:41", "is to bear a heavy load you know to get", "13:44", "yourself in and check for you now and", "13:47", "for you in the future and then to do the", "13:48", "same for your family in your community", "13:50", "and that there's real nobility in that", "13:52", "and there's real meaning and more the", "13:54", "other thing that I've been suggesting to", "13:55", "people and I also believe this is that", "13:57", "and I think that the guys that have come", "13:59", "to talk to me especially the ones that", "14:00", "have had real real rough life's they", "14:02", "really understand this if you don't get", "14:04", "your act together and you let yourself", "14:05", "slide then what kind of moves in to take", "14:09", "the place of what you could have been is", "14:11", "something that's really not good at all", "14:13", "so it's not only that if you're living", "14:15", "like a dissolute life that you're not", "14:18", "aiming at anything positive and so you", "14:20", "don't have any real meaning and you're", "14:22", "subsume by anxiety and all of that", "14:24", "hopelessness but something kind of", "14:26", "hellish moves in there - - to occupy", "14:28", "that place and so then you end up making", "14:30", "things worse and when you know one of", "14:33", "the things I learned about studying", "14:34", "totalitarian systems whether they were", "14:37", "on the right or the left was that part", "14:39", "of the reason that the totalitarian", "14:40", "horrors of the 20th century manifested", "14:42", "themselves was because average people", "14:44", "didn't take on the proper responsibility", "14:46", "they shut their eyes when their I should", "14:48", "have been open even though they knew it", "14:50", "and they didn't said things they knew", "14:52", "they shouldn't have done and said and", "14:53", "that was what supported those horrible", "14:55", "systems so you know if you don't get", "14:57", "your act together then you leave a", "14:59", "little space for hell and I really", "15:01", "believe that don't you think when things", "15:04", "are happening like something like Nazi", "15:06", "Germany I would imagine that during that", "15:08", "time the people that were not in support", "15:10", "of it felt helpless", "15:11", "whether you're you're in Germany you're", "15:14", "a part of this country this country is", "15:16", "turning towards this horrible situation", "15:19", "where Jewish people are being put in", "15:22", "trains and you know the people that", "15:25", "didn't speak out in that I don't", "15:28", "necessarily know if it's a lack of", "15:29", "discipline or just complete fear and", "15:32", "paralysis", "15:33", "it's our fear for sure I mean you know", "15:36",

if you're gonna forestall that sort", "15:48", "of thing you have to do it early you", "15:49", "know because the longer you wait the", "15:51", "higher the price you pay for it but", "15:53", "isn't it so it's hard to take that jump", "15:55", "early because you're not exactly sure", "15:57", "where it's going that's true and your", "15:58", "and well and you're also likely to be", "16:00",

the idea so let's", "25:06", "assume that that scales as you take on", "25:09", "heavier and heavier loads that more and", "25:12", "more of you you get more and more", "25:13", "informed because

"26:25", "before you and that's all part of your", "26:28", "biological potentiality and then if you", "26:31", "can push yourself then all of that", "26:33", "clicks on and that turns you into who", "26:35", "you could be that's and that's the", "26:36", "reason Tatian of that positive ancestral", "26:39", "father so that's", "26:40", "why you rescue your father from the", "26:42", "belly of the

because that's a weird idea okay", "27:15", "so what does that mean let's think about", "27:16", "it psychologically well maybe it means", "27:18", "that well that's your job is the world's", "27:21",

"that as the price of being okay so", "28:03", "that's one that's one responsibility", "28:06", "you're responsible for addressing the", "28:08", "suffering in the world it's not to give", "28:10", "you some meaning seems to me then the", "28:12", "next thing is there's a story of course", "28:14", "that Christ met the devil in the desert", "28:16", "and so that's the encounter with", "28:17",

"57:11", "basic traits you can ask some questions", "57:13", "like well do men and women differ and so", "57:16", "what you do is you just give the", "57:17", "questionnaire you can either fill it out", "57:19", "yourself or have other people fill it", "57:21", "out on your behalf so and it could be a", "57:23", "teacher could be a parent you know and", "57:25", "that's all been done and what you find", "57:27", "is there are systematic differences", "57:28", "between men and women and the biggest", "57:30", "differences are that women experience", "57:31", "more negative emotion and that

or are they biological and", "58:24", "the answer to that is tricky because how", "58:28", "much something is social and how much it", "58:30", "is biological actually depends on the", "58:32",

between men and women", "59:29", "by the egalitarian social policies and", "59:32", "so then you'll find out and here's the", "59:35", "hypothesis if the difference is between", "59:37", "men and women are primary primarily", "59:40", "social then as cultures become more", "59:42", "egalitarian men and women will become", "59:44", "more alike that's not what happened the", "59:47", "opposite happened the more egalitarian", "59:51", "this society and it turns out the richer", "59:53", "this society because that's also being", "59:55", "discovered now the more different men", "59:57", "and

quite a bit", "60:19", "of overlap right because you'd be right", "60:21", "40% of the time but the problem is is", "60:24", "that a lot of selection takes place at", "60:26", "the extremes maybe you're only concerned", "60:29", "about disagreeable people when they", "60:30", "become violent and maybe it's only the 1", "60:33", "in 50", "60:34", "most disagreeable person who's violent",

"60:46", "people do things like like employment", "60:48", "selection so the biggest difference", "60:50", "that's been discovered between men and", "60:52", "women and this is the one that gets",

it's", "61:03", "one full standard deviation and so what", "61:05", "that means is that if you are a man you", "61:09", "would have to be more interested in", "61:11", "people than 85% of men to be as", "61:14", "interested in people as the 50th", "61:16", "percentile woman and you'd have to be", "61:19", "more interested in things than 85% of", "61:22", "women to be as interested in things as",

right", "61:37", "right stem feeis guess the other thing", "61:39", "that's happened is that the more", "61:41", "egalitarian the society the fewer women", "61:43", "go into the STEM fields", "61:45",

"167:40", "disease but I don't think anyone's had", "167:42", "to deal with such a like a radically", "167:46", "transformative medium yeah like we have", "167:49", "this range of possibilities well and you", "167:51", "ain't seen nothing yet", "167:52", "right I mean this is just getting going", "167:54", "well have you been watching the Boston", "167:56", "Dynamics videos yeah oh my god in here", "167:59", "oh yeah a bit I mean the amount of", "168:02", "progress they've made in five years it's", "168:04", "just absolutely staggering I bet they", "168:06", "smell like sulfur and they don't even", "168:07", "know well Elan musk was on the podcast", "168:13", "talking about some new development their", "168:15", "work on called neural link and that this", "168:18", "is some radical

said it was gonna come out", "168:30", "within you know X amount of months yeah", "168:32", "well they've already you know there are", "168:33", "scientists who've already managed direct", "168:36", "brain to computer links right you can", "168:39", "get monkeys for example to move a", "168:40", "robotic arm mm-hmm and so and I suspect", "168:43", "that you know you're you can you can", "168:45", "learn to control single neurons in your", "168:47", "face my suspicions are that we'll be", "168:50", "able to develop technologies that'll be", "168:51", "wearable that won't have to be neural", "168:53", "implants that you'll be able to", "168:54", "communicate with neroli and that's not", "168:57", "very far down the road and the you know", "169:00", "the the probability that were", "169:02", "going to build you know you know about", "169:08", "what's-his-name Kurtz walls idea the", "169:10", "singularity it is well it's a wild idea", "169:13", "and it seems somewhat improbable and I", "169:15", "had a friend who once told me that if", "169:18", "something is impossible then it won't", "169:19", "happen you know there'll be something", "169:21", "that will come up to stop it that you", "169:23", "won't expect and maybe the singularity", "169:25", "is one of those things but you know I", "169:27", "know a lot of guys who are in the", "169:28", "high-end computational world and a lot", "169:32", "of them are convinced that we're within", "169:33", "a decade of a machine that's as powerful", "169:35", "as a human brain and I know people have", "169:36", "been saying that for a long time but", "169:38", "Jesus you know computers are getting", "169:40", "good at emotion recognition they're", "169:42", "getting really good at facial", "169:43", "recognition they can communicate with", "169:45", "one another they can imitate those", "169:47", "Boston dynamic robots are pretty damn", "169:49", "impressive and they're mostly autonomous", "169:51", "we've got all sorts of things that can", "169:53", "navigate on the road like these", "169:54", "autonomous cars like all these things", "169:56", "are they're coming together real fast as", "169:59", "you ever watched black bear on Netflix", "170:02", "the only one I watched was the one that", "170:04", "outlined what the Chinese are now doing", "170:06", "to their own people", "170:07", "oh yeah the CRISPR one yeah yeah no no", "170:09", "the one where everything you do is rated", "170:11", "wrong right the social network one right", "170:14", "right right", "170:15", "yes which which is quite frightening and", "170:17", "reasonably probable Oh 100% probable I", "170:21", "was talking about the one I think it's", "170:23", "called heavy metal it's about autonomous", "170:25", "robots that seek out people and kill", "170:27", "them and you know these artificial", "170:30", "intelligence people that are making", "170:32", "these Boston dynamic robots and you know", "170:35", "the scariest one that I read about was a", "170:37", "DARPA one called the eater robot EA TR", "170:41", "it operates on it uses as a fuel it uses", "170:46", "biological material as fuel which means", "170:49", "if you're kidding you're kidding", "170:51", "normally EA C R so this is going to be", "170:55", "able to eat dead bodies in the field", "170:59", "theoretically and use it as fuel oh good", "171:02", "oh good oh good that sounds like a fine", "171:04", "thing to develop fucking imagine an army", "171:07", "of robotic armed artificially", "171:11", "intelligent things corpse eaters eat", "171:13", "corpses in order to have fuel to", "171:16", "while someone's obviously imagining that", "171:18", "it's made hmm this is a real thing yeah", "171:21", "well I mean part of the reason that I'm", "171:23", "doing what I'm doing with regards to", "171:25", "these lectures is you know I think that", "171:27", "we're in a time of unparalleled", "171:28", "possibility yeah so for good and for and", "171:31", "for evil and that the more people that", "171:35", "there are out there who have their acts", "171:36", "together the better the probability that", "171:38", "we're going to be able to manage it", "171:39", "because we've all got some pretty hard", "171:41", "decisions to make coming up real fast", "171:42", "you know in these guys that are working", "171:44", "on these AI systems I'm hoping that the", "171:47", "ones that are more ethically oriented in", "171:49", "a proper direction will be the ones that", "171:51", "have the operand I'm really hoping that", "171:53", "so yeah collectively and what's the", "171:56", "matter I was looking into it because", "171:57", "this and that came up before that it", "172:00", "breaks the Geneva Conventions if they", "172:02", "actually eat dead bodies you can't do", "172:04", "that yeah whatever", "172:06", "it's robot war dude that David", "172:10", "inventions out the window yeah no I I I", "172:14", "couldn't agree with you more and I think", "172:16", "personally this is important and", "172:18", "collectively it's very important that I", "172:20", "mean I just think it's I think what you", "172:23", "wrote 12 rules to life we need rules we", "172:26", "need rules to be able to figure out how", "172:28", "to navigate everything that's working", "172:30", "well that's why I think that the", "172:32", "individual level of analysis is the", "172:34", "right one is that I'm hoping that you", "172:36", "know that like every time someone comes", "172:38", "up and talks to me and says look you", "172:39", "know I was in a dark place and I got my", "172:41", "life together and this is how it's going", "172:42", "I think that tilts the scales", "172:45", "non-trivial e towards a good outcome yes", "172:48", "and the more people that that's", "172:50", "happening to the better and I don't", "172:51", "think there's a more effective way of", "172:52", "doing it than to concentrate on the", "172:54", "individual no I don't think there is", "172:56", "either and it's happening a lot you know", "172:57", "I I hear it every day I hear it every", "172:59", "day people that find you and find a lot", "173:02", "of other inspirational people online and", "173:03", "just Jaco and there's so many of ya", "173:06", "there's so many and there's so much fuel", "173:08", "now for inspiration yeah pretty fun that", "173:11", "that inspiration could become popular", "173:13", "yeah it's crazy hmm you saw this come no", "173:16", "kidding no kidding and encouragement and", "173:18", "one of the things that's quite sad is", "173:20", "how little encouragement people need and", "173:23", "it's so touching you know because I'm", "173:25", "constantly in a state of like being", "173:27", "overwhelmed well even with what happened", "173:29", "this more", "173:29", "when I went to Whole Foods you know", "173:31", "because it's overwhelming to have people", "173:32",

overwhelming but every", "173:54", "time that happens as far as I'm", "173:55", "concerned it's a victory and yeah that's", "173:57", "a victory that multiplies to as far as", "173:59", "I'm concerned so I'm hoping that well", "174:02", "every little bit helps you know that's", "174:05", "it certainly does and by the way if you", "174:06", "meet me and you have one of those", "174:07", "stories and
