your home and so she uh has a surgeon", "13:35", "come", "13:35", "and the surgeon determines that yes the", "13:37", "breast has to come off", "13:38", "and says i'm going to return but i'm not", "13:40", "going to tell you the day", "13:42", "which would make me more anxious he", "13:44", "thought it was going to help her not", "13:45", "focus on it but", "13:47", "all you would be thinking about right is", "13:48", "when is this guy going to shoot that's a", "13:50", "person without breasts", "13:51", "yeah yeah exactly he was like i'll just", "13:54", "show up it'll be easy", "13:55",

survive and she", "14:13", "talks about how it's so vascular", "14:15", "that the blood blinds him at one point", "14:18", "and so like just when you think it can't", "14:19", "get worse you can't see and he's", "14:21", "under um she is under his hand for an", "14:24", "hour and a half when he cuts away", "14:26", "and she survives she ends up living", "14:28", "along and", "14:29", "somewhat happy life i'm sure she had a", "14:31", "lot of nightmares yeah there we see uh", "14:32", "so do they tie this woman down like how", "14:34", "do they", "14:34", "oh yeah they would have definitely had", "14:36", "to restrain her i mean oh", "14:38", "i mean people were probably a little bit", "14:40", "stronger or more able to", "14:42", "adapt to pain than we are but", "14:44", "nonetheless there would have been some", "14:45", "pretty heavy", "14:46", "what year was this that was in the 1840s", "14:49", "do we know when", "14:50", "cancer became common or was it always", "14:53", "common in humans", "14:54", "that's that's a good question the oldest", "14:56", "uh archaeological record i believe", "14:58", "is 2 000 years old of metastatic cancer", "15:01", "so it's older than you think they're um", "15:04", "diagnosing it for for centuries and", "15:07", "centuries i'm not really an expert in", "15:09", "history of cancer but it is around and", "15:11", "so with breast cancer", "15:14", "you know probably by the time it got to", "15:15", "the stage of mastectomy it probably", "15:17", "would have spread", "15:18", "if you think about like you know it", "15:19", "being visible to the naked eye", "15:21", "but yet she survived she did survive and", "15:24", "so then you have to question whether she", "15:25", "had breast", "15:26", "cancer or maybe it was some kind of just", "15:27", "like yeah maybe a cyst and she went", "15:29", "through that for that", "15:30", "but yeah and again it before antiseptics", "15:33", "before lister comes on", "15:35", "um and comes up with germ fighting", "15:37", "techniques this would have been so", "15:38", "dangerous because you have this open", "15:40", "cavity and wounds", "15:41", "and so joseph lister when he comes up", "15:44", "with his antiseptic techniques he", "15:45", "actually performs a mastectomy on his", "15:47", "sister on his dining room table oh", "15:49", "christ", "15:50", "which and she survives and that's in the", "15:52", "book see this this would be a great", "15:53", "movie don't you think", "15:54", "yeah i do think it would be a great", "15:56", "movie it's like", "15:57", "it would be a great movie for the coen", "15:59", "brothers yeah you know because it's so", "16:01", "chaos filled i know and all that kind of", "16:04", "grittiness", "16:05", "and yeah i could do good period pieces", "16:08", "too", "16:08", "yeah plus they could make it more", "16:10", "entertaining let's make this happen joe", "16:12", "i have no pulse i'm not a part of that", "16:15", "world", "16:15", "but this guy with the face where they", "16:18", "cut that tumor out of his face so for", "16:19", "24 minutes that's all it took to cut", "16:21", "that thing out of his face", "16:22", "and that that case yeah and remember of", "16:24", "course it depended on the skill of your", "16:26", "surgeon", "16:26", "so he goes to a very good surgeon named", "16:29", "james syme", "16:30", "um but there there's a story so going", "16:32", "back to penises", "16:34", "um there's lithotomy is the removal of", "16:36", "the stone", "16:37", "um which you saw kind of a a", "16:39", "demonstration there um", "16:41", "and it was incredibly painful so they", "16:42", "stuck a rod down the penis and they cut", "16:44", "through the scrotum they", "16:45", "removed the stone and of course there", "16:46", "was no pain medication and it was just", "16:48", "awful did they drink", "16:50", "you know it's kind of a myth because of", "16:52", "course drinking within your blood", "16:54", "um but someone asked me they said i", "16:57", "heard that surgeons would", "16:59", "punch the patient out and i was like wow", "17:01", "you'd have to be really", "17:02", "good to knock someone out on a first", "17:05", "punch and of course you'd do more damage", "17:07", "you could do a lot of damage to that", "17:08", "that's definitely didn't happen unless", "17:10", "someone can prove me wrong maybe there's", "17:11", "like a weird example", "17:13", "but i've never come across that um so so", "17:16", "it was kind of it was", "17:17", "you and the surgeon and um with the", "17:20", "lithotomy it takes about a good surgery", "17:23", "it took about five minutes", "17:24", "well there's a guy named steven pollard", "17:26", "in 1828 who goes in to have this done", "17:28", "now it's incredibly embarrassing it's", "17:30", "you're you know you're naked from the", "17:32", "waist down it's an embarrassing", "17:33", "operation it's painful", "17:35", "he's broadened the theater and the", "17:37", "surgeon", "17:38", "ends up taking over an hour because he's", "17:41", "so inapt", "17:41", "and the patient is screaming you know", "17:43", "please just stop just stop", "17:45", "and um and the surgeon yells back at him", "17:48", "for having abnormal anatomy", "17:50", "which how would you like that you're", "17:52", "sitting there on the on the table and", "17:53", "you're being blamed for this going wrong", "17:55", "and he pulls through the operation but", "17:56", "he does die a post-operative infection", "17:58", "abnormal anatomy how so he just said you", "18:01", "have abnormal anatomy and so", "18:03", "on the autopsy report it was revealed", "18:04", "that there was nothing", "18:06", "abnormal about his anatomy the surgeon", "18:07", "just was really announced", "18:09", "oh god yeah it wasn't blaming the guy", "18:12", "did you have lunch before this yeah i", "18:14", "did but i'm all right good that's well", "18:15", "that's good because then you won't faint", "18:17", "well i hosted fear factor for success", "18:20", "that's true", "18:20", "i've seen everything yeah there's", "18:22", "nothing what's like the worst", "18:24", "i mean was there ever a segment on fear", "18:26", "factor that you thought oh i don't know", "18:27", "if i can watch that", "18:29", "no no i uh", "18:32", "when they had a drink come that was", "18:33", "rough that was what got the show", "18:36", "canceled yeah", "18:37", "that was the second version of fear", "18:39", "factor when it came back for a brief", "18:41", "period of time and they were going way", "18:42", "too hard", "18:43", "they were trying to do themselves yeah", "18:46", "they were like", "18:47", "fear factors back and it's crazier than", "18:49", "ever and they just went", "18:50", "way over the top that's what they do", "18:52", "with tv right like they're always", "18:53", "pushing the boundaries they didn't have", "18:54", "to", "18:55", "yeah we could have just gone with", "18:56", "regular fear factor and we would have", "18:58", "all been fine", "18:59", "we could do historical fear factor we", "19:01", "could like recreate these sort of", "19:02", "horrible things it was a blessing in", "19:04", "disguise but um", "19:06", "this this surgery", "19:09", "as we know it when did it first start", "19:12", "like what is the first historical", "19:15", "recounting of an actual doctor", "19:19", "oh or you mean um someone saying they're", "19:22", "a licensed doctor when did it", "19:24", "start like like asking really hard", "19:26", "questions no no", "19:28", "i know so little about history it's like", "19:30", "19th 18th century", "19:31", "um it's it you know we have evidence", "19:33", "again in the archaeological records of", "19:35", "surgical procedures going far back but", "19:37", "who did them", "19:39", "they would have been um you know", "19:41", "sometimes what they call them wise women", "19:43", "come", "19:43", "cunning women um barber surgeons so", "19:46", "one of my yeah i guess they're good at", "19:50", "razors right", "19:51", "yes yeah actually barber surgeons used", "19:53", "to do things like pull your teeth they", "19:54", "used to blood wet", "19:56", "and so the barbered pole which is red", "19:58", "and white", "19:59", "is red and white because it was", "20:00", "advertising their services as blood", "20:03", "letters so what they would do is they", "20:04", "would tie these bloody rags around the", "20:06", "pole", "20:07", "and it would whip around the pole i know", "20:09", "it's one of my favorite stories", "20:12", "and um and the the ball at the top", "20:14", "represented the bowl that would catch", "20:15", "the blood", "20:16", "and the stick would have been the stick", "20:18", "that you held to kind of get your veins", "20:20", "to stick out and people were blood let", "20:21", "for all kinds of reasons like you would", "20:23", "do it", "20:23", "like a purge or a diet or or you would", "20:25", "do it because you were ill", "20:28", "the idea being that you had produced too", "20:29", "much blood and you needed the blood to", "20:31", "be let to", "20:32", "kind of restore balance in your body", "20:34", "what do you think it would be like to go", "20:36", "back in time and hear someone say", "20:37", "something that's stupid", "20:39", "like you're sick we need to remove some", "20:41", "of your blood you have too much blood in", "20:43", "your system", "20:43", "lindsay you're gonna joe you're gonna", "20:45", "send all these like crazy academics", "20:47", "historians who are like", "20:48", "we can't yeah there you go tonsorial", "20:51", "services what does that mean and you", "20:54", "know what else the barbershop quartet", "20:57", "comes from the idea that the barber", "20:58", "surgeons often had a musical loot in the", "21:01", "office that you would", "21:02", "play or the patient would play it was", "21:04", "like musical therapy", "21:05", "um so there's all kinds of hangovers", "21:07", "from it and you know the demon barber", "21:10", "sweeney todd yes so this is kind of a", "21:12", "one of these stories that pops up and", "21:14", "they think that it might be that medical", "21:15", "practitioners were trying to", "21:17", "um undermine the legitimacy of the", "21:20", "barbers", "21:21", "so you kind of either get this story", "21:23", "that the barber is this like sort of", "21:24", "demon figure who's", "21:25", "chopping you up and selling you and", "21:27", "making you into pies", "21:29", "or is that a legit one because that", "21:32", "seems like nonsense", "21:33", "well it seems like it's a recreation", "21:35", "it's an older one well it seems like", "21:36", "parody like look says", "21:38", "listen to my troubles no charge listen", "21:40", "to your troubles 50 cents", "21:41", "they might have had that on their barber", "21:43", "thing yeah when they're cutting bullets", "21:45", "out of you it says bullets removed two", "21:46", "bucks maybe i don't know they're all", "21:48", "drunk pomade mustache wax", "21:51", "yeah people people thought that bullets", "21:52", "were uh that gunpowder was poisonous so", "21:55", "a surgeon would often", "21:56", "amputate if you were shot oh god um", "21:59", "until they kind of realized that", "22:00", "sometimes it was okay", "22:02", "to just keep the bullet in depending on", "22:04", "on where it was", "22:07", "it could just be like a recreation of", "22:08", "something that someone found maybe", "22:10", "and they're selling that as a piece", "22:12", "maybe right probably yeah", "22:14", "yeah and we get the we get the red um", "22:16", "blue", "22:17", "and white barber poles now so what", "22:20", "happened was the barber surgeons and the", "22:22", "surgeons", "22:22", "split off professionally at some point", "22:25", "in history", "22:26", "and so the surgeons start to use blue", "22:28", "and white poles and the barbers use red", "22:29", "and white poles", "22:31", "and i think now the red white and blue", "22:32", "is is like the patriotic", "22:34", "red white and blue but but the", "22:36", "traditional barber pole would have been", "22:37", "red and white and it would have", "22:38", "signified", "22:39", "that you could come in and get your", "22:40", "blood lighting because those those", "22:42", "bloody rags would have been", "22:43", "out there on the pole um before they had", "22:45", "the pole they would advertise by putting", "22:47", "just bowls of congealed blood in the", "22:49", "window", "22:51", "and then in london they decided i think", "22:53", "it was about the 14th century they said", "22:55", "no more", "22:56", "of that so the barbers started to throw", "22:57", "the blood into the river which", "22:59", "was also equally gross yeah so the", "23:01", "barber surgeons would have definitely", "23:04", "been doing minor surgical procedures and", "23:06", "they would have been more affordable", "23:07", "than the surgeons and the physicians", "23:08", "themselves", "23:09", "um but nobody could really do much for", "23:12", "you in that period", "23:13", "according to our own sort of 21st under", "23:16", "you know 21st century understanding", "23:18", "um but i always say to go back to your", "23:20", "question about you know", "23:22", "um how would it feel to hear something", "23:24", "so dumb", "23:25", "well what do you think today that you", "23:27", "know in 100 years we're going to look", "23:28", "back at", "23:28", "and there's there's definitely going to", "23:30", "be stuff right that's going to come back", "23:32", "and go i can't believe that", "23:34", "you know we used to do that in fact i", "23:36", "think that this is probably going to get", "23:38", "people to go no that totally works you", "23:39", "know that that um", "23:41", "uh trend of cupping yeah now that you", "23:44", "see", "23:44", "so that was also 17th century so they", "23:46", "would cut they would have these heated", "23:48", "cups and they would create this blister", "23:49", "and then they would cut it open", "23:51", "with this really sharp instrument and", "23:52", "that's how they would bleed you so it's", "23:54", "kind of this weird thing that's coming", "23:56", "back but for slightly different reasons", "23:58", "i don't think there's any evidence that", "23:59", "cupping is real", "24:01", "no i don't think so either and i like to", "24:03", "point people to the past because if", "24:04", "we're going to make fun of", "24:05", "you know what they were doing in the", "24:06", "past it's kind of making a a", "24:08", "reappearance so to speak um but people", "24:10", "do all kinds of", "24:11", "uh weird things now too like they eat", "24:13", "the um placenta", "24:15", "yeah there's there's no medical evidence", "24:17", "that that has any kind of health benefit", "24:19", "yeah but it's edible i think that's", "24:21", "incredible yeah you can eat it", "24:23", "well it's funny because that actually", "24:25", "segues into into this lovely object this", "24:27", "half skull here", "24:28", "um my friend zane wiley creates these", "24:31", "these are actually cereal bowls", "24:32", "[Music]", "24:33", "but uh and the reason why i brought it", "24:35", "was because it um", "24:37", "opens up a conversation about something", "24:38", "that i like to talk about which is", "24:40", "corpse medicine so people used to", "24:41", "actually eat dead bodies", "24:43", "um for medicinal purposes um what parts", "24:46", "so if you had epilepsy in the early", "24:49", "modern periods when we were like talking", "24:50", "like 16 17th 18th centuries", "24:52", "um people would drink the blood of an", "24:55", "executed criminal so someone who lost", "24:57", "their hand", "24:58", "like the idea was that the life cut", "25:00", "short", "25:01", "that the blood was very powerful force", "25:03", "and so you get these sort of", "25:04", "um drawings of people gathered at the", "25:07", "scaffold you know this poor bastard's", "25:09", "gonna lose his head and these people are", "25:10", "like holding cups up to catch the blood", "25:13", "and it didn't work and epilepsy was so", "25:15", "awful because it was so misunderstood", "25:17", "and you can imagine you know when", "25:19", "someone goes into a seizure", "25:21", "it's it's um it's scary and if you don't", "25:24", "understand what's happening you could", "25:25", "think that it's witchcraft or there's", "25:27", "all kinds of things that", "25:29", "um people thought about that disease so", "25:31", "these people were quite desperate they", "25:32", "were drinking the blood of executed", "25:34", "criminals", "25:34", "good lord they ground up um mummies", "25:38", "ancient mummies and they would make it", "25:39", "into pills and did all kinds of things", "25:42", "right so i", "25:42", "so i always point this out we eat the", "25:44", "placenta today it's kind of like", "25:46", "you know a form of um ingesting", "25:49", "bodily uh yeah so there you go", "25:53", "so people were just super super", "25:55", "desperate back then", "25:57", "yeah people i mean of course there was", "25:58", "not much that could be done right", "26:00", "but but we do some kind of form of", "26:02", "corpse medicine and organ donation", "26:04", "so we're taking dead body parts we're", "26:06", "not eating them but we're taking them", "26:07", "into our body to cure", "26:09", "ourselves yeah i have a cadaver graft on", "26:12", "my right knee", "26:13", "oh yeah i have one in my jaw really yeah", "26:16", "well i had a gotten a huge fistfight you", "26:19", "know", "26:20", "i had some gum disease up here and then", "26:23", "they had to like graft a little like", "26:25", "piece of cadaver bone", "26:28", "but they don't call it cadaver bone did", "26:29", "they call it everyone to you don't they", "26:30", "call it", "26:31", "um freeze dry bone or something no it", "26:34", "wasn't bone", "26:34", "it was uh they called it an allograft", "26:37", "but it's a", "26:38", "it's a cadaver they use the achilles", "26:40", "tendon", "26:41", "for the acl because the achilles tendon", "26:44", "is much larger than an acl", "26:45", "so it's stronger and if you don't are", "26:48", "you familiar with the way it works it's", "26:49", "really kind of interesting", "26:50", "no the way it works it's not like it", "26:52", "takes over", "26:54", "it's not like an organ transplant so you", "26:56", "don't you don't have to worry about your", "26:57", "body rejecting it in the same way", "26:58", "although some people sometimes people's", "27:00", "bodies don't accept it or doesn't work", "27:02", "but um they take this graft they put", "27:05", "this", "27:06", "new tendon in place this new uh ligament", "27:09", "in place rather", "27:10", "and then your body re-proliferates", "27:13", "that's amazing ligament with cells so", "27:15", "it's even though it'll feel", "27:17", "like it's healed up within like a month", "27:18", "or two like your knee will feel a little", "27:20", "bit weak from the surgery", "27:22", "but people get a distorted perception of", "27:23", "how strong it actually is and", "27:25", "fighters yeah in particular i know", "27:28", "several fighters who have wound up", "27:30", "re-injuring their knee because they", "27:31", "thought it was okay real", "27:33", "really it was very gummy and very weak", "27:36", "so how long does it take to heal", "27:38", "before like six months yeah so yeah like", "27:40", "six to nine months they recommend", "27:42", "but it's amazing what we can do now i", "27:44", "mean when you think about", "27:46", "150 years ago that i'm talking about and", "27:48", "today yeah", "27:49", "it's just the in and i always because", "27:52", "i'm a big joseph lister fan i always say", "27:54", "that", "27:54", "if we hadn't understood germs there", "27:56", "would be no way to go deep into the body", "27:58", "would there be sure", "27:59", "yeah um and so he opens up this sort of", "28:02", "huge field with medicine and a lot of", "28:03", "advanced", "28:04", "advancements are made off the back of it", "28:06", "but um", "28:07", "but it was it was a gritty time and um", "28:10", "it definitely", "28:12", "you definitely could die very easily", "28:14", "life was very cheap back then", "28:16", "yeah i mean i could only imagine just", "28:19", "the the idea that woman getting her", "28:20", "breasts removed on her kitchen table", "28:22", "yeah there was another um there was a", "28:25", "little boy he was 12 years old his name", "28:26", "was henry pace and he was told by the", "28:28", "surgeon he had to have his leg", "28:30", "removed and he said as little kids do", "28:32", "would it hurt and the surgeon said no", "28:34", "more than having a tooth pulled", "28:36", "so he was very unprepared so they", "28:38", "brought him to the operating theater and", "28:39", "he was so awake and so aware he", "28:42", "remembers counting six strokes of the", "28:43", "saw before his little leg fell off", "28:45", "why'd they have to cut his leg off he", "28:47", "broke it and", "28:48", "um it was just a sprain and they just", "28:52", "decided to", "28:53", "take it off no i mean if there was a", "28:54", "compound fracture the chances of it um", "28:56", "becoming infected was", "28:58", "quite high so when lister comes along", "29:00", "and he's trying to figure out what's", "29:02", "causing infection he notices that if", "29:04", "it's a clean break and there's no break", "29:06", "in the skin usually it heals okay", "29:08", "but if there's a break in the skin it", "29:09", "gets infected and usually it leads to", "29:11", "some kind of gangrene or septicemia", "29:13", "and that's how he starts to wonder it", "29:15", "must be something coming from outside", "29:17", "and getting into this wound that is", "29:19", "causing um the infection", "29:21", "but he breeds louis

so that's exactly what", "29:47", "happens with lister", "29:48", "and it's hard for us to imagine because", "29:50", "germs we understand them today it seems", "29:52", "obvious to us", "29:53", "but back then a surgeon didn't wash his", "29:55", "hands or his instruments because", "29:57", "why would he wash his hands or his", "29:59", "instruments if they were going to get", "29:59", "dirty with the next patient", "30:01", "so you have to get into the mind the", "30:03", "logical mind of a victorian", "30:05", "surgeon they wore aprons i think jamie", "30:08", "i'd also sent a picture of like a", "30:09", "surgeon with with his apron on um", "30:11", "actually it's a picture of a butcher um", "30:14", "but it gives you that kind of idea of", "30:16", "of what your friendly victorian surgeon", "30:18", "would have been wearing", "30:19", "and um that apron the more blood it had", "30:22", "on it it was like a sign of pride almost", "30:24", "because that meant that your surgeon was", "30:26", "very experienced and had a lot of blood", "30:28", "on it", "30:29", "that's a butcher though that is a", "30:31", "butcher yeah similar tools of the trade", "30:33", "yep similar

kind of", "30:42", "picture", "30:43", "they would worn those really tall top", "30:45", "hats and um", "30:46", "those crazy plaid colors and it's it's a", "30:48", "very colorful time before

have", "31:28", "been wearing sort of black and white and", "31:30", "very dull colors", "31:31", "so when i think about this movie because", "31:33", "i think about it a lot i think about", "31:35",

lister", "31:51", "so they were experimenting with all", "31:52", "these drugs themselves oh yeah it was", "31:55", "like", "31:56", "it was just a crazy time so ether is", "31:59", "so my book um begins with the first", "32:01", "operation", "32:02", "under anesthesia and i wanted to start", "32:05", "there because i think if anybody has", "32:06", "ever thought about the history surgery",

becomes much more", "32:16", "dangerous because", "32:18", "the surgeon still doesn't understand", "32:19", "germs but he doesn't have the patient", "32:21", "fighting him anymore so he's more",

you", "32:50", "insensible what was that like", "32:51", "and so you get these kinds of stories of", "32:53", "medical students sniffing it and", "32:55", "drinking it in fact i believe there's", "32:57", "still a place in london you can get an", "32:58", "ether cocktail", "33:00", "again i don't i don't endorse it it's", "33:02", "highly flammable", "33:04", "so people also smoked a lot in operating", "33:07", "theater so you can imagine that there", "33:08", "were a lot oh", "33:09", "chris yeah there were a lot of accidents", "33:10", "um but", "33:12", "but you drop it on a basically because", "33:14", "it evaporates really quickly you drop it", "33:15", "on a strawberry and then you dunk it", "33:16", "into champagne and it's supposed to get", "33:18", "you really high", "33:19",

"33:27", "just have a bunch of ubers ready yeah", "33:29", "yeah exactly just", "33:30", "yeah or carriages like in the victorian", "33:33", "um", "33:34", "so so people were yeah definitely trying", "33:36", "and then of course have you tried it", "33:37", "i've not tried it i haven't found that", "33:39", "bar yet but yet you were wanting to", "33:40", "experiment on the people that came to", "33:42", "your book", "33:42", "oh yeah why not that would be the best", "33:44", "thing great story you know", "33:46", "i feel like you should probably dip your", "33:48", "toe in first yeah maybe maybe try it out", "33:51", "yeah maybe for the next book yeah um but", "33:54", "uh yeah and so so you have ether in sort", "33:57", "of the mid-19th century and then of", "33:58", "course later you have cocaine", "34:00", "you have um opium which is um", "34:03", "well actually cocaine comes along and is", "34:06", "presented as sort of a cure to the", "34:08", "opiate", "34:09", "uh the morphine addiction so like take", "34:11", "cocaine instead", "34:12", "and um i had brought it's in my mary", "34:15", "poppins bag", "34:16", "i'll show it to you later after the show", "34:17", "i brought a postcard that shows a", "34:19", "dentist and he's pulling a tooth and the", "34:21", "person wrote underneath just had a tooth", "34:23", "pulled with cocaine", "34:25", "so they were they were using it for all", "34:26", "kinds of things and doctors were", "34:28", "becoming", "34:28", "addicted themselves to these drugs um", "34:31", "then heroin comes along", "34:33", "bayer invents heroin heroin is uh given", "34:35", "to your children it's put in all kinds", "34:37", "of things", "34:38", "again it's um it's positioned as you", "34:40", "know break your cocaine addiction now", "34:43", "with heroin so it just it was just a", "34:44", "crazy period and it was really", "34:46", "sort of in the early 20th century when a", "34:48", "lot of the stuff started to be regulated",

make you test", "35:10", "positive for cocaine", "35:12", "i don't know yeah jamie will find it but", "35:14", "there was it was some", "35:16", "it was some evidence i think what they", "35:18",

cocaine and hashish which", "36:47", "makes sense", "36:48", "the results caused an immediate stir", "36:50", "what the come on let's cut to the chase", "36:52", "here folks", "36:54", "first thing to say archaeologists are", "36:55", "not just being stubborn about this there", "36:57", "are many reasons not to think the traces", "36:58", "of drugs and nine mummies", "37:00", "means what is it what

that there were some other things", "38:11", "that would make the you test positive", "38:13", "for cocaine", "38:14", "oh it's interesting what sort of like", "38:15", "poppy seeds make you toast

"38:35", "it says uh since passing this corpses", "38:37", "off recently deceased as ancient mummies", "38:39", "was a thriving tourist scam in egypt in", "38:41", "the victorian era like it could have", "38:43", "um that doesn't make sense because the", "38:45", "tests were done after the experiments", "38:47", "even assuming the cocaine was actually", "38:49", "found on the mummies it's possible this", "38:50", "could have been a contamination that", "38:51", "occurred", "38:52", "after the discovery yeah okay so a bunch", "38:55", "of coke heads were fondling mummies", "38:57", "well they wanted those mummies because", "38:59", "they wanted to eat them as i said you", "39:00", "know they ground them up and", "39:01", "did you use that ancient egyptian", "39:03", "mummies they used that too yeah", "39:04", "think about how much was destroyed", "39:06", "because people had to eat well i think", "39:07", "about that all the time there's a", "39:08", "fantastic", "39:09",

a quack remedy when", "39:21", "it's a cure-all we still have quack", "39:22", "remedies you know take a pill lose a lot", "39:24", "of weight", "39:26", "things that are causing people to lose",

right now there's an imax", "39:37", "exhibit in", "39:38", "los angeles at one of the museums i saw", "39:40", "it about a year ago", "39:42", "but they have a king tut exhibit and", "39:44", "then um", "39:46", "on top of that they have this gigantic", "39:48", "imax theater which is fantastic", "39:50", "and they show like all these different", "39:54", "tombs that they had discovered and how", "39:56", "they discovered them and", "39:57", "but it makes you really when they've", "39:59", "discovered king tut's tomb", "40:01", "we have no idea how many similar tombs", "40:04", "there were that were looted", "40:05", "over the you know yeah think about how", "40:07", "much was lost", "40:08", "yeah absolutely i mean what we have you", "40:11", "know in the museums is just sort of a", "40:12", "fraction of", "40:13", "what we know and and still stuff is", "40:15", "coming to light it's just incredible", "40:17", "um but yeah they they the victorians are", "40:20", "responsible for destroying a lot", "40:22", "for taking those mummies and just", "40:24", "grounding them up", "40:25", "and all kinds of things yeah it's what", "40:28", "gets me is", "40:29", "what was the mode like where was the", "40:32", "theory", "40:32", "like where'd the theory come from like", "40:34", "when you want to take a mummy and make", "40:36", "it", "40:36", "a powder some of it would have been sort", "40:38", "of folk medicine", "40:39", "influence um you know there's there's", "40:42", "this idea of sympathetic magic", "40:43", "so um for instance if uh you if i", "40:46", "stabbed you with a sword it gets very", "40:48", "violent", "40:49", "um you could be healed if i put this", "40:52", "sort of special sympathetic powder", "40:54", "on the sword it would heal you so it was", "40:57", "sort of this", "40:58", "um healing by distance so all kinds of", "41:02", "strange ideas existed", "41:04", "but and that's why it's important when", "41:06", "you're studying the history of medicine", "41:07", "to really get into the mindset because", "41:09", "it's so wildly different to the way we", "41:11", "think right um", "41:12", "and and you know actually do you know", "41:14", "what this is that i brought this", "41:16", "um if people are just listening it's", "41:17", "it's a long beaked", "41:19", "mask like a birdbath yeah", "41:22", "i do not know what that is okay so this", "41:25", "a lot of people think this is a venetian", "41:26", "mask this is", "41:27", "actually particularly um a particular", "41:29", "example from venice", "41:30", "it is um what people would have doctors", "41:33", "would have worn during the bubonic", "41:34", "plague", "41:35", "so it's called the plague doctor mask", "41:37", "and so um it was invented in the 17th", "41:39", "century", "41:41", "by a french doctor and the idea behind", "41:43", "it was so people thought that disease", "41:45", "was spread by this thing called miasma", "41:47", "which are like", "41:48", "little particles in the air they're sort", "41:50", "of associated with bad smells so if", "41:52", "something smells bad it's probably not", "41:53", "good for you is what they thought", "41:55", "and it kind of makes sense because if", "41:56", "like you know you're in a really um", "41:59", "if you're in a slummy area of the", "42:00", "victorian period it probably has a lot", "42:02", "of disease it probably doesn't smell", "42:03", "good so that was sort of the thinking", "42:05", "behind it so what you would do is you", "42:07", "would put", "42:07", "sweet smelling herbs into the beak", "42:11", "and so you would be smelling this in it", "42:12", "would protect you from those evil miasma", "42:15", "whoa yeah it's and you know is that a", "42:18", "real one", "42:19", "no we don't actually have um i don't", "42:21", "believe there's an example of a real one", "42:23", "from the 17th century but there's a lot", "42:24", "of illustrations of the plague doctor", "42:26", "and he would have been wearing a hat he", "42:29", "would have been wearing a cape", "42:30", "um leather gloves like sort of just", "42:33", "protecting himself oh there you go", "42:35", "that's a real one authentic 16th century", "42:37", "plague doctor mask preserved and on", "42:39", "display", "42:40", "at the well there you go another one", "42:42", "dustin", "42:45", "german museum of medical history but i", "42:47", "questioned that because it was", "42:48", "invented in the 17th century so if it's", "42:51", "real it's going to be a little bit", "42:52", "later um interesting but we don't know", "42:55", "how much they were worn because they", "42:57", "would have been expensive a lot of", "42:58", "doctors weren't very noble so", "43:00", "the plague broke out they got the hell", "43:01", "out of there um there was sort of a", "43:03", "phrase go", "43:04", "far and go long you know get out and", "43:06", "don't come back for a while", "43:08", "there wasn't much they could do for you", "43:09", "they had a stick as well that they", "43:12", "would sort of poke the patient with so", "43:14", "they wouldn't have to touch the patient", "43:16", "and kind of", "43:16", "have them turn over and they can you", "43:18", "know yes you have the plague there", "43:20", "wasn't much they could do for you", "43:22", "um we can cure this is they did not know", "43:24", "what", "43:25", "what what germs were so they really", "43:27", "didn't understand what the plague was", "43:28", "they they had sort of a concept of of", "43:31", "contagion", "43:32", "so if you broke out with the plague they", "43:34", "would probably quarantine you", "43:36", "in your house and they put a big cross", "43:38", "on the door and so", "43:40", "people would bring food and um you'd um", "43:43", "you know put a basket outside of your", "43:44", "window with a rope and you take", "43:46", "and so they'd do that until everybody", "43:47", "was dead in the house or that the plague", "43:49", "had passed and they felt that you were", "43:51", "safe to come out into the general", "43:52", "population so there was an idea that", "43:54", "these things were contagious", "43:56", "um but not again in the way that we kind", "43:58", "of understand disease", "43:59", "diseases being spread today god that's", "44:01", "so strange that they would", "44:05", "you would not know what was going on", "44:07", "like people would just start", "44:08", "dying and you'd be like what is this you", "44:09", "would think first it was yeah it could", "44:11", "be god's curse", "44:12", "um uh and and people say you know oh the", "44:15", "plague mask is so terrifying", "44:17", "um it's pretty creepy can i put it on", "44:19", "it's super creepy", "44:21",

have", "44:46", "like a huge population of a city wearing", "44:48", "mass", "44:49", "and covering their identities they have", "44:51", "to cut back which kind of sucks because", "44:53", "you know that's like the fun of the", "44:55", "carnival", "44:55", "um so now they're they're um uh cutting", "44:58", "back where you can wear them in public", "45:00", "places and things like that",

going on um it's certainly sort", "45:36", "of ominous", "45:37", "you know when you see the hazmat so it", "45:40", "it's a weird thing that exists", "45:42", "because in a strange kind of way it", "45:44", "probably did protect the plague doctor", "45:46", "because he was covering himself up but", "45:47", "it protected him for the wrong reasons", "45:49", "he still didn't understand how disease", "45:51", "was spread", "45:52", "are you aware of the theory of alien", "45:54", "abduction", "45:55", "being a distant memory of childbirth", "45:59", "no yeah there's a there's a theory that", "46:02", "is actually being", "46:04", "um tossed about that these people that", "46:07", "have this", "46:08", "ancient well they have this memory of", "46:11", "childbirth right so", "46:12", "all of a sudden you're being born", "46:13", "there's bright lights above you", "46:15", "there's a man or a woman who's the", "46:18", "surgeon with a mask that covers their", "46:20", "face so all you see is their eyes", "46:21", "okay and everything looks bright and and", "46:24", "it's terrifying", "46:25", "and clinical and you're on this table", "46:27", "and everything's cold", "46:29", "most of these alien abduction", "46:31", "experiences", "46:32", "that people recount they take place in", "46:35", "some sort of", "46:36", "a medical facility yeah yeah and", "46:39", "everything is bright and strange", "46:41", "and cold and they think that what this", "46:44", "is", "46:44", "is they're they're saying that we had", "46:47", "this idea", "46:48", "that children don't have memories that", "46:50", "babies don't have memories", "46:51", "and so they say well why wouldn't they", "46:53", "have memories that's ridiculous of", "46:54", "course they have memories they have", "46:55", "brains", "46:56", "they grab your finger they look you in", "46:58", "the eye they would have a memory of", "46:59", "every second that they were born and", "47:02", "it's probably one of the most profound", "47:04", "and disturbing memories because", "47:06", "before that everything is incredibly", "47:08", "peaceful you're inside the mother's womb", "47:11", "and then you're just like taken out", "47:12", "pulled out and then", "47:14", "there's this bright light above you", "47:15", "you've never experienced any light", "47:17", "yeah so every and your visual perception", "47:20", "your field of view is all distorted", "47:22", "right this is the first time you're", "47:22", "using your eyes", "47:24", "that's why people have so it's like", "47:25", "snapping into this memory", "47:27", "yeah this early memory that's", "47:28", "interesting this is a theory it makes", "47:30", "sense to me", "47:30", "because if you think about more sense", "47:32", "than the abduction", "47:34", "so well it does because people don't", "47:36", "really go anywhere see the thing about", "47:38", "the abduction thing", "47:39", "is they put like cameras in people's", "47:41", "rooms", "47:42", "and uh and they say they have these", "47:44", "alien abduction experiences", "47:46", "but they don't go anywhere so what", "47:47", "they're doing is they're dreaming yeah", "47:49", "i mean which is the mind is amazing and", "47:53", "it's so powerful and we know so little", "47:55", "still yeah so", "47:56", "also like these all these i mean it's", "47:58", "it's kind of duh", "47:59", "because they all happen while you're", "48:01", "sleeping yeah yeah yeah 90 and", "48:03", "you're right they tend to be medical", "48:05", "yeah", "48:06", "it's very medical in nature right you're", "48:08", "being examined and then there's also", "48:11", "going back to childbirth there's also a", "48:13", "lot of people that have these", "48:15", "experiences that they are being told", "48:18", "that either they're taking their baby", "48:21", "away from them", "48:22", "or they're studying their baby or that", "48:24", "they had a baby inside of them that they", "48:26", "didn't know about and that the", "48:27", "aliens have put it there and they're", "48:29", "taking it out right yeah", "48:31", "yeah i mean it even goes back to the", "48:32", "virgin birth right yeah", "48:34", "it's all very weird but this uh this", "48:37", "memory that people have from", "48:39", "childhood is uh most likely", "48:42", "uh you know probably a pretty intense", "48:46", "yeah that's interesting memory that's", "48:47", "always there yeah and it's your first", "48:50", "memory", "48:50", "yeah and some people can tap into it and", "48:52", "some people can't yeah sure", "48:53", "yeah yeah that's what it's also a theory", "48:56", "while natural childbirth is supposed to", "48:57", "be less traumatic", "48:59", "like women having natural childbirth in", "49:01", "a bathtub you know", "49:02", "yeah that that is actually we're kind of", "49:04", "like moving back to you know it's", "49:05", "um men start to get involved in", "49:07", "childbirth around the 17th century 18th", "49:09", "century", "49:11", "it was mostly women um so women in the", "49:14", "village would come and actually the term", "49:16", "um gossip comes from the idea the women", "49:19", "who would spread the word in the village", "49:20", "that someone was going into labor they", "49:22", "were called the gossips", "49:23", "so they would spread the word it became", "49:25", "sort of a negative thing later", "49:26", "so the gossips would spread the word the", "49:28", "women would come in this", "49:30", "was a female only chamber um and men", "49:33", "were not really allowed in", "49:34", "a man might be brought in if the mother", "49:37", "was dying or if the child was dying", "49:39", "and then in that case instruments were", "49:41", "brought into the birth", "49:42", "the birthing chambers so the doctor", "49:45", "might come in", "49:45", "and he might um take these sort of", "49:48", "forceps and", "49:49", "pick the baby apart and take the baby", "49:51", "out the baby would die", "49:53", "but in those cases it was like really", "49:54", "extreme like this was gonna happen like", "49:56", "either the mother was gonna die the baby", "49:57", "was gonna die both of them were gonna", "49:58", "die", "49:59", "or if the baby was coming out feet first", "50:01", "yeah i mean midwife", "50:02", "a capable midwife could could handle", "50:04", "that um", "50:05", "but this you know the caesarean section", "50:08", "people", "50:09", "think that it comes from the term the", "50:11", "idea that julius caesar", "50:13", "was ripped from the womb of his mother", "50:15", "but", "50:16", "it's unlikely that that story is true", "50:18", "because his mother lives into old age", "50:20", "so probably the term cesarean comes from", "50:22", "the latin term meaning to cut", "50:25", "and the first sort of uh record we have", "50:28", "of this happening i think is in the 16th", "50:30", "century and it's a", "50:31", "farmer and he takes the instruments that", "50:33", "he uses to castrate his pigs to cut this", "50:36", "baby out of his wife", "50:38", "um yeah and and we don't have any", "50:40", "records of whether this this probably", "50:42", "didn't work again no idea of germs all", "50:44", "this kind of stuff", "50:45", "um we don't know if she lived we yeah i", "50:48", "don't have there's no", "50:49", "sort of it doesn't follow the records", "50:50", "don't follow the story um but she", "50:52", "probably died and the baby probably died", "50:54", "as well and for people don't know", "50:56", "they uh castrate pigs to make them more", "50:57", "edible they uh they oftentimes", "51:00", "castrate them and then let them loose", "51:02", "because then they", "51:03", "they concentrate on grass and not ass", "51:05", "that is a", "51:06", "actual farmer's term i i have you know", "51:09", "talking about cesarean sections and", "51:11", "castrating pigs who knew those two", "51:12", "things well that's what they do with the", "51:14", "steelers", "51:15", "as well the difference between a steer", "51:17", "and a bull is the steer is castrated", "51:19", "they castrate them because they make", "51:22", "better steaks", "51:23", "things i learned on this yeah you don't", "51:25", "want a muscular", "51:27", "jacked bowl no probably not be very", "51:29", "chewy yeah", "51:30", "exactly you want yeah that that", "51:33", "buffalo above my friend adam greentree", "51:35", "shot that in australia and", "51:37", "the my friend cam was chewing on a piece", "51:40", "of his", "51:41", "for one piece for half an hour oh my", "51:44", "gosh it was that", "51:45", "muscular and yeah i mean i guess that", "51:47", "makes sense two thousand pounds", "51:49", "sack of steel so it was not good no not", "51:52", "not the thing you want to sit down and", "51:53", "have a meal", "51:54", "no i mean they say they vary like", "51:57", "sometimes", "51:57", "some of them you can eat yeah you know i", "52:00", "mean you can eat them they're all", "52:02", "buffalo yeah but they're just insanely", "52:05", "dense crazy how big i mean when you see", "52:07", "the skull it's just", "52:10", "the size of it is incredible yeah it's", "52:12", "uh it's also an invasive species so they", "52:14", "have no natural predators there's just", "52:16", "thousands and thousands of them", "52:17", "destroying the countryside so wow", "52:19", "people travel up to the northern lands", "52:21", "um", "52:22", "for artaland i forget that the name of", "52:24", "the place where they go when they", "52:25", "hunt these things wow yeah they're huge", "52:28", "yeah they yeah", "52:29", "australia is a trip i mean it is really", "52:31", "a wildlife experiment yeah", "52:32", "they brought in so many animals right as", "52:35", "well", "52:36", "yeah and they're not indigenous and", "52:37", "they're just doing a lot of damage yeah", "52:39", "um so when you think about the history", "52:42", "of", "52:42", "surgery and you you concentrate on this", "52:46", "one very particular time in this book", "52:49", "in this book yeah but as a medical", "52:51", "historian like when", "52:52", "what first of all what led you to that", "52:54", "like why you seem so it's a real thing", "52:56", "oh yeah i'm super normal look at all", "52:58", "these skulls and stuff in front of me um", "53:00", "i you know i'm like that kid who never", "53:02", "grew out of the obsession with tales", "53:04", "from the crypt", "53:05", "yeah ripley's believe it or not you know", "53:07", "the shrunken heads i actually did a", "53:09", "um a segment for a documentary in the", "53:12", "shrunken heads and i had to go out to", "53:14", "poland i actually got to", "53:15", "hold these things that i was always", "53:16", "fascinated with growing up well people", "53:18", "don't know that like they think the", "53:19", "skulls in there", "53:20", "that's why they don't understand that's", "53:22", "how you shrink your head yeah and it's", "53:23", "it's amazing because um what they do is", "53:26", "they", "53:26", "obviously they take the skull out and", "53:27", "it's a process and", "53:29", "this documentary was looking at they", "53:31", "were dna testing them because", "53:33", "um the tribe that makes these skulls", "53:35", "they were done for a specific purpose", "53:37", "to trap the soul of the warrior that", "53:40", "they killed so that", "53:41", "there was a spiritual reason behind it", "53:43", "but what they were finding was that some", "53:44", "of these shrunken heads were", "53:46", "female um which probably means that", "53:49", "um as westerners came into these areas", "53:52", "they wanted to collect these", "53:53", "shrunken heads as curiosities of course", "53:54", "and so they traded guns for", "53:56", "heads and so it kind of drove up the", "53:59", "uh the demand for these these shrunken", "54:02", "heads so they started killing women well", "54:03", "it wasn't just", "54:05", "just anybody and it might not have been", "54:06", "um killing them it might have just been", "54:08", "taking", "54:08", "bodies of people who had already died", "54:10", "but they definitely aren't", "54:12", "all authentic in the sense that they", "54:13", "were uh", "54:15", "yeah killed in battle and so it's just", "54:16", "kind of an interesting but i got to", "54:18", "interact and see these shrunken heads so", "54:19", "i was that weird creepy kid that", "54:21", "you know no one really wanted to talk to", "54:23", "i joked

yeah", "81:29", "edward jenner", "81:30", "invented it and actually the biggest", "81:32", "anti-vaxxer movement", "81:34", "or uh protest happened in the 19th", "81:36", "century", "81:37", "100 000

people worried about", "82:11", "in the past as well", "82:13", "but gender is an incredible figure that", "82:15", "is incredible when you", "82:16", "stop and think about the fact that this", "82:18", "is still going on today", "82:20", "with the internet yeah yeah all the i", "82:22", "mean you can find out i mean i had dr", "82:24", "peter hotes on", "82:26", "recently to talk about

"82:43", "the way information is", "82:45", "now spread of course echo chambers it is", "82:47", "you know it's confirmation bias is the", "82:49", "real danger", "82:50", "in the past it was actually harder to", "82:53", "get that message out", "82:54", "but um a lot of uh you know you get", "82:57", "famous sort of um", "82:58", "cartoons of of people sort of turning", "83:00", "the cows to the

"83:09", "um so yeah people people had that fear", "83:11", "of um", "83:12", "vaccines for a long time but edward", "83:14", "jenner coming up with", "83:15", "his vaccine undoubtedly saved millions", "83:18", "of people's lives", "83:19", "undoubtedly yeah it's just so it's so", "83:20", "amazing that that's", "83:22", "the problem is still around today", "83:26", "even with all the information that we", "83:27", "have available yeah i think you know", "83:29", "there was um", "83:30", "a fox news uh newscaster", "83:34", "who recently said that he doesn't wash", "83:35", "his hands because he can't see germs i", "83:37", "don't know who it was i think he was", "83:38", "joking", "83:40", "hopefully he said the next day he", "83:41", "actually washes his hands", "83:43", "i hope so so people were sending that to", "83:44", "me because again like lister", "83:46", "right and um and i i always tell people", "83:49", "you know", "83:49", "it is that idea of what you can't see", "83:51", "it's hard to convince people", "83:53", "and with lister you know if you think", "83:55", "about it here's this young guy and he's", "83:57", "coming along and he's saying there's", "83:58", "these invisible little creatures", "84:00", "and they're killing your patients and", "84:01", "trust me i have this really weird", "84:04", "instrument called a microscope and i can", "84:05", "see them and it was a leap of faith", "84:07", "he was also accusing the older surgeons", "84:09", "of inadvertently killing their patients", "84:11", "because if they weren't washing their", "84:12", "hands they were leading to higher", "84:13", "mortality rates", "84:14", "so they probably fought against it as", "84:15", "well yeah so there was there was huge", "84:17", "pushback so what lister ultimately does", "84:19", "is he turns to the younger generation", "84:21", "and he changes their minds", "84:22", "and so it's a slow burn it's not like", "84:25", "you know the movie moment", "84:26", "unfortunately where it just happens all", "84:28", "at once and it takes quite a long time", "84:31", "um and it's it's weird that it takes so", "84:33", "long because if you think about him", "84:34", "coming in 1876", "84:36", "to america it's after the civil war", "84:39", "people were dying soldiers were dying of", "84:41", "high infection rates they were packing", "84:42", "wounds with mud", "84:44", "i mean it couldn't get worse than that", "84:46", "right and so people were dying of all", "84:48", "the", "84:48", "all these kinds of infections he comes", "84:49", "to philadelphia to convince", "84:51", "the medical community and speaker after", "84:54", "speaker just denounces him on the first", "84:56", "day", "84:57", "and then he gets up and he he does his", "84:59", "demonstrations and he starts to slowly", "85:01", "change people's minds", "85:02", "but it takes a long time the the cover", "85:04", "of the um", "85:05", "of the american book is um the american", "85:08", "version i should say", "85:09", "is um a famous painting by people can", "85:12", "see that by samuel gross", "85:14", "it's called the gross clinic um the guy", "85:16", "in the middle it is gross as well but", "85:18", "the guy in the middle is samuel gross", "85:19", "and he so didn't believe in lister", "85:21", "that he would walk into the room and", "85:23", "he'd slam the door and he'd say there", "85:25", "mr lister's germs can't get in anymore", "85:27", "and you can see in this that he's sticky", "85:29", "he's wearing his street clothes he's", "85:30",

the patient and she's wearing", "85:40", "black because she expects her son to die", "85:42", "so", "85:43", "so this is the u.s cover and for the uk", "85:45", "cover i think i sent that to you jamie", "85:47", "um it's uh i sent you a picture of both", "85:50", "covers side by side it's another", "85:52", "painting by eakins", "85:53", "and it was done within 10 years and it's", "85:55", "called the agnew clinic and it's totally", "85:57", "different because", "85:58", "the doctors are wearing white there's a", "86:00", "sense that they understand germs there's", "86:01", "a sense that antisepsis is being used", "86:03", "there", "86:04", "so that kind of before and after shot in", "86:06", "such a short period that lister is able", "86:07", "to change the world", "86:08", "what made you choose uh different covers", "86:10", "for the uk and the us version well", "86:12", "so that's actually writers don't oh", "86:14", "there you go so you can see", "86:16", "so penguin published it in the uk so", "86:17", "they've stylized the original painting", "86:19", "but you kind of get a sense of what it", "86:21", "would have looked like and actually you", "86:23", "have women", "86:24", "appearing in the operating theater", "86:27", "professionally as nurses so this is", "86:28", "after the florence nightingale", "86:30", "revolution as well so it still looks",

"86:40", "revolution so florence knight", "86:41", "if florence nightingale is in this book", "86:44", "a little bit people always wonder why i", "86:46", "didn't speak about her as much but", "86:47", "actually she didn't believe in germs at", "86:49", "first she thought lister was quite", "86:51", "uh hysterical with his idea of germs but", "86:53", "she was working towards sanitation in", "86:55", "hospitals so they're working towards the", "86:57", "same goal but just with different", "86:59", "slightly different tactics so she", "87:01", "revolutionizes", "87:02", "nursing to
