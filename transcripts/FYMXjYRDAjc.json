mine I think my early twenties", "43:23", "when when Peter did that and I remember", "43:25", "reading about it and thinking no like", "43:29", "what how how does this one want to do", "43:33", "and I was just really getting into", "43:34", "climbing a lot I didn't compute but", "43:37", "Peter Croft I think in guys like him and", "43:40", "like Alex just have a wiring that's very", "43:43", "very different than the rest of us", "43:45", "and it seems reckless to many many", "43:47", "people but what I do seems reckless too", "43:49", "many people so it's so relative and", "43:51", "there's a scale you know and and people", "43:53", "that would look at Alex and be like", "43:55", "you're crazy man it should you're gonna", "43:56", "get in like he's like whatever man I'm", "43:58", "sure yeah there is a scale there's like", "44:00", "a yeah well you what about physically", "44:04", "like is there like an optimum build you", "44:06", "like for a basketball you really want to", "44:07", "be tall and thin right is is there an", "44:09", "optimum build for what", "44:11", "does mean I think you know sinewy and", "44:14", "and the strength to weight ratio is is", "44:17", "obviously you know the best climbers are", "44:19", "usually then pretty thin and you know", "44:22", "carry themselves well yeah and you know", "44:24", "it's it's uh he's got big hands like not", "44:27", "necessarily big like basketball player", "44:29", "but like his fingers or sausages use", "44:32", "these fat fingers from constantly", "44:34", "training them almost calloused yeah well", "44:37", "the just the amount of weight that he", "44:39", "can carry on his hands he's got to be", "44:41", "pretty unusual this so this finger thing", "44:44", "that he does like what is the well he", "44:46", "did the campus board or a finger you", "44:48", "know peg boards like for wrestling", "44:50", "that's kind of like a campus board is", "44:51", "like a inverted sort of board that you", "44:53", "climb up just for strength and it works", "44:55", "your core and your arms and your chest", "44:57", "and your delts and stuff but then then", "44:59", "the fingerboard allows you to get you", "45:01", "know mano doy double doy you know two", "45:04", "fingers strength so he can then slot and", "45:07", "then pull on one of those so it", "45:08", "strengthens all your tendons and your in", "45:10", "your hands and your finger look", "45:12", "ticularly I'm just little holes carved", "45:15", "out of a sometimes it's a it's a that's", "45:18", "all right there yeah so sometimes it's", "45:20", "good sometimes it's a composite it's", "45:22", "like almost like a little cubby shelf", "45:24", "and so you stick your hands in there", "45:26", "yeah and then there's routines I guess", "45:28", "there's two finger pockets and three", "45:30", "finger puck oh wow you you use one two I", "45:32", "do yeah", "45:33", "wow I was one two and then I'll try and", "45:34", "hang you know and then count the 30 hang", "45:37", "and then go to finger and hang and he", "45:40", "did this after he summited yeah so we", "45:42", "went down and like got interviewed he", "45:44", "goes sorry man I gotta go do a workout", "45:46", "now how is he not tired", "45:49", "well just loves that's why he's the best", "45:52", "right I swear he is yeah Wow workable so", "45:55", "did this exist 20 years ago was there a", "45:58", "lot of people free soloing 20 years ago", "46:00", "those like that's the Peter Croft you", "46:02", "know those guys there was a few and back", "46:04", "in the old camp for Yosemite days I can", "46:07", "you know 70 though I mean it's this was", "46:09", "the place this was the the birth of it", "46:11", "and then there was some dudes that were",
