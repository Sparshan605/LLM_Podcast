the", "11:48", "place it's not it's not the same thing", "11:49", "it's it's not because um because the", "11:53", "guys themselves can fight you know when", "11:55", "you see what happened last night

it", "81:38", "weird though that like this is the only", "81:40", "sport MMA is the only sport where you", "81:43", "have these names of these organizations", "81:46", "and they're more like boxing

almost think", "82:28", "like we'd all be better off if it was", "82:30", "just MMA you know to call it the UFC the", "82:34", "problem with that is it's great because", "82:36", "everybody knows is a very high quality", "82:38", "to the UFC events the production value", "82:41", "is amazing it is so much attached to it", "82:43", "and so much history but at the end of", "82:45", "the day it's about MMA fights", "82:47", "that's what it's about and whether it's", "82:49", "in Bellator or 1fc", "82:51", "it's about how good are these matchups", "82:54", "how good at the fighters what am I gonna", "82:56", "say well I believe it all started when I", "83:02", "believe I believe it all started when", "83:05", "credentials were taken away from top MMA", "83:07", "media organization our

other", "83:35", "companies at that time had web they took", "83:38", "those credentials away now whoever came", "83:40", "in was like well shit they're gonna do", "83:42", "it to those big-time you know MMA", "83:44", "websites why would they would do the", "83:46", "same shit to me if I don't tow the line", "83:48", "and that all of a sudden became like", "83:50", "fighters now when you see them put it's", "83:52", "all about UFC it's not about anything", "83:55", "that they're doing like you as a fighter", "83:57", "I think look even though it's an", "83:59", "individual sport and sure you guys", "84:01", "should be pumping your organization I", "84:02", "get it", "84:03", "but you should also be pumping you", "84:05", "because after you're done the UFC will", "84:07", "be fine", "84:08", "you need to worry about building your", "84:10", "brand whatever it is you do to make you", "84:12", "big yeah and and it's all for I'm all", "84:15", "for the organization the organization", "84:16", "does a lot for the fighters I'm not here", "84:18", "to piss on any company or any", "84:20", "organization they need to make sure", "84:21", "though that they're doing what they can", "84:23", "to make as much money as they possibly", "84:24", "can and I go back to the Strikeforce", "84:26", "thing I was making almost double what", "84:28", "the guys were making in the

you should be the head when", "137:18", "you're on the ground yeah like if I", "137:20", "stuff your takedown I should be only", "137:21", "your head right there on all fours right", "137:23", "it doesn't matter especially if you're", "137:24", "not against the cage", "137:25", "yeah like against the cage is the only", "137:27", "argument against it because I can't move", "137:29", "he's stuck

there", "137:50", "wasn't a lot of movement it was like", "137:51", "here and he was so small as like bam bam", "137:53", "cut guys and the fight was stopped there", "137:55", "was risk I'll bloody and for the actual", "137:58", "fan at home watching the fight not all", "138:00", "fans like to watch blood right you know", "138:02", "and so it's like I want to see a good", "138:04", "fight I want to see guys getting", "138:05", "starched and knocked out right but I", "138:07", "want to see a good fight and so I felt", "138:09", "like with when they went triforce didn't", "138:11", "have elbows you posture up it creates", "138:14", "more space creates more space let's just", "138:16", "do guy do his moves as well as try to", "138:17", "get back to the feet you know or I can", "138:19", "back out and try to go be ground pound", "138:21", "there's a lot of things that you can", "138:22", "love it for variation why would you like", "138:24", "it knees on the ground but not elbows", "138:26",

want", "138:41", "see fights end where I want to see them", "138:43", "and by a knockout I mean that would like", "138:45", "to use everything yeah I think knees to", "138:48", "the ground but also elbows I think", "138:50", "everything on it yeah I just think that", "138:52", "especially the knee to the ground like", "138:55", "you shouldn't be okay that you shoot a", "138:57", "takedown and then you're safe yeah from", "139:00", "in one cuz you're on all fours that", "139:02", "seems crazy to me if you're not safe it", "139:04", "should be that the wrestlers forced to", "139:06", "roll to their back to avoid the knee to", "139:09", "get the fuck away it doesn't make any", "139:11", "sense that you in the center of the", "139:13", "Octagon", "139:14", "you wouldn't be able to hold on

knees and you're fishing", "139:32", "for the legs it's just not a fun fight", "139:34", "and also - it makes it makes us look", "139:36", "like doing what the fuck we're doing", "139:38", "right you know and it's like I do John", "139:39", "you're way better than that but at the", "139:41", "time you also don't want to stand with", "139:42", "Roy McDonald and that all changes if you", "139:44", "allow knees to the ground yes it does", "139:46", "position the whole exchange changes yep", "139:48", "you're gonna see them start sprawling", "139:49", "knee in the head spawn and then the", "139:51", "other thing is well look if if the", "139:53", "wrestler is a good obviously there are a", "139:55", "lot of good rustlers in the sport but", "139:57", "let's just say the knee misses and he's", "139:58", "able to grab the leg now he can get the", "140:00", "takedown so there's benefits on both", "140:02", "sides the guy knees and it lands the guy", "140:04", "getting knocked out but
