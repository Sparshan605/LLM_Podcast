there", "68:53", "yeah I think the lack of of rebuilding", "68:56", "myself you know we do altitude training", "68:58", "we do altitude it's called Auto lab", "69:00", "something I breathe into at certain", "69:02", "times certain time lengths like", "69:05", "different intervals throughout the", "69:06", "throughout training camp instead of", "69:10", "living and breathing altitude and I'd",

air", "69:21", "you create more red blood cells and the", "69:23", "more red blood cells you have the more", "69:24", "oxygen you transport and so they're", "69:26", "thinking if you go down to sea level", "69:27", "you're gonna have more oxygen to", "69:29", "transport but your body has been able to", "69:31", "train as hard and recover as you can at", "69:34", "sea level and then use the hypoxic state", "69:37", "by breathing in this machine to get the", "69:40", "red blood cell production okay so you", "69:42", "can get the benefit of altitude without", "69:44", "having to live there what I had heard is", "69:46", "that the best move was to train at sea", "69:49", "level but live at altitude", "69:51", "I don't think theory I mean I don't", "69:53", "think your recovery is good enough what", "69:55", "about those on what my coaches told me", "69:57", "you know that makes sense and this is", "69:59", "making sense yeah what do you think", "70:01", "about those tents where like people", "70:03", "sleep in those tents", "70:04", "I've tried one if it's hard to sleep", "70:07", "yeah so if you cuz you're pumping it up", "70:10", "so it gets hot in there for one plus you",

sense", "70:29", "yeah you definitely feel the difference", "70:32", "um and totally makes sense that you", "70:34", "would be able to train harder at sea", "70:36", "level and you can push your body to that", "70:38", "super far extreme that you wouldn't be", "70:40", "able to get there at altitude but if you", "70:43", "live it out to suit for a few years", "70:45", "doesn't your body totally normalize that", "70:47", "yeah but then I'm but I'll be fighting", "70:49", "at sea level right you know I don't yeah", "70:52", "I don't know enough it's just what I was", "70:54", "told I know I

spike like the more", "101:55", "and more mainstream gets the more like", "101:57", "legit makes it and the more legit 'it is", "101:59", "the more science behind it the more that", "102:00", "like why wouldn't guys that are smarter", "102:02", "same calivita go for football because", "102:05", "there's money and there's like exposure", "102:07", "behind it when his fighting was so raw", "102:09", "and just like whatever I feel like since", "102:11", "it's so legitimized those smart trainers", "102:15", "and now the guys that were then fighting", "102:17", "forever now coaches it just makes it", "102:20", "more legit and you have more science and", "102:22", "the ways to train behind it ya know it's", "102:24", "it's really exciting but it's still", "102:26", "growing and I feel like we're on the", "102:27", "cutting edge of everything we don't we", "102:30", "don't miss everything we don't miss", "102:31", "anything like we're in the this is by", "102:33", "far if any place I've ever trained the", "102:36", "most scientific and smart way to train", "102:39", "that's so exciting man it really is TJ's", "102:42", "got a a bump in the martial art", "102:43", "evolutionary

I'm gonna do better", "103:08", "against this guy southpaw and stay stop", "103:10", "all the rest of the fight because he", "103:11", "sees that advantage and being able to do", "103:14", "that I mean boxers used to say like", "103:16", "never switch your stance your defense", "103:17", "won't be as good but now make it like", "103:19", "this Marvin Hagler used to switch all", "103:21", "the time you know he's in the greatest", "103:22", "of all time", "103:23", "and then the you know there's orthodoxes", "103:25", "softball but then there's a whole world", "103:26", "of things that you can do offensive and", "103:28", "defensively during the change of the", "103:29", "stance as well that's one thing to", "103:35", "switch your stance into a fight better", "103:36", "that stance but
