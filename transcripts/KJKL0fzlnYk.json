used to be", "93:12", "and that actually gets added onto your", "93:13", "bill you didn't get paid", "93:15", "no you would get like money for tour but", "93:17", "like it wouldn't cover like a bus and a", "93:19", "band and all this so that", "93:20", "right the label would supplement that", "93:22", "with what they called tour support", "93:24", "which would also become part of the debt", "93:26", "you owed the label right", "93:27", "but as you built your live audience your", "93:30", "guarantees would go up", "93:32", "sooner or later you could stop taking", "93:33", "that money", "93:35", "and then your record sales would pay", "93:37", "that off hopefully if you were doing", "93:38", "well enough", "93:39", "and now you got your own stream of", "93:41", "revenue with live

needy it always", "94:10", "it", "94:11", "all boils down to this too and i hope", "94:12", "somebody one day like really", "94:14", "investigates this and makes some sort of", "94:15", "like documentary about it is like", "94:17", "they had so many opportunities to be", "94:19", "ahead the movie industry didn't take the", "94:21", "same hit", "94:22", "they took hits and they deal dealt with", "94:23", "piracy but they", "94:25", "the music industry had a moment if you", "94:27", "remember there was like some kids that", "94:28", "got in trouble for downloading", "94:30", "ridiculous amounts of music and their", "94:32", "parents were being held responsible", "94:33", "yeah and the music industry backed off", "94:35", "of it because", "94:37", "the news wasn't good the movie

"um my thing not at first", "95:19", "my thing became later like okay this is", "95:21", "what this is the wave whatever", "95:23", "but if i doubt my philosophy was if i", "95:26", "downloaded your shit", "95:27", "and i liked it i would go i'd go buy it", "95:30", "me too like", "95:31", "if i if i downloaded it it was trashed", "95:33", "in vain i looked it as like a taste test", "95:35", "that's okay yeah okay maybe if more", "95:37", "people adapted that", "95:38", "things but again the record industry had", "95:41", "plenty of opportunities to jump ahead of", "95:43", "it", "95:43",
