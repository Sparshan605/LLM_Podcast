like", "143:06", "maybe they should you know make the", "143:07", "weight in a variable there of 5 pounds", "143:10", "or something no we wouldn't do that", "143:12", "because then they would people would", "143:13", "just get heavier they would make sure", "143:15", "that they were heavy like and then very", "143:16", "the same right see if you varied it if", "143:19", "you said like you don't have to weigh in", "143:20", "in 155 you can be as heavy as 160 right", "143:22", "and they would go to get up to 180 down", "143:24", "to 160 name it still but they'd say", "143:26", "they've had
