that we", "13:11", "that we had tested some of them had more", "13:14", "estrogen blockers some had almost no", "13:17", "estrogen blockers some had small traces", "13:19", "that none of the pills were consistent", "13:20", "so it was obvious that and we certainly", "13:23", "tested several different packages so it", "13:25", "was obviously that that these pills were", "13:27", "probably getting made in the same", "13:28", "machine and there was just traces right", "13:31", "literally which is enough to show up in", "13:33", "your system yeah literally we found some", "13:36", "of these dick pills that had none", "13:37", "no estrogen blockers damn yeah exactly", "13:41", "so I took one that was just contaminated", "13:43", "enough and literally I got tested two", "13:45",

we", "14:03", "sold an item it's contaminated where", "14:04", "does that leave you how much time did", "14:06", "they suspend you for I got to spend it", "14:07", "for for a year but from starting from", "14:10", "back in July so now I fight him to live", "14:13", "mm I love you sada I love what they're", "14:15", "doing I don't agree with things like", "14:16", "that I don't agree with things like that", "14:18", "because what you took does not enhance", "14:20", "your performance though it does it's", "14:22", "especially in such a trace amount I feel", "14:25", "like in certain
