subprime loans that belong", "07:13", "to janitors who were gonna foreclose", "07:16", "within ten minutes all right and they", "07:20", "were telling people that oh we have this", "07:23", "new mathematical process that allows", "07:25", "that actually makes this stuff really", "07:27", "safe and you can put it in your in your", "07:32", "College endowment you can put in your", "07:34", "pension fund and so all these people you", "07:38", "know whose retirement monies were based", "07:40", "on securities we're buying all this shit", "07:44", "that they thought was was triple-a rated", "07:47", "and that's that's how they woke up and", "07:48", "you know and in 2008-2009 they found", "07:51", "their 401ks or were you know wiped out", "07:55", "by 40% or whatever it was I mean people", "07:57", "were losing their minds right now over", "07:58", "the past 24 hours because of Iran really", "08:00", "what you're hearing is you're hearing a", "08:01", "lot of the the the critics of the", "08:04", "current president and apparently there", "08:06", "are some that are saying oh he's you", "08:09", "know he's in she gets closer to a", "08:10", "military conflict with Iran well these", "08:12", "are the same brainiacs that said well he", "08:14", "was inching as closer to war with North", "08:16", "Korea and they everybody was completely", "08:18", "wrong on that I'm not saying that", "08:20", "rouhani and the others in the Iranian", "08:22", "regime might not you know decide to", "08:23", "become more bellicose but I think", "08:27", "they're I think they're looking at it", "08:28", "wrong I mean the this idea that cuz", "08:31", "there's a couple of parts part one is", "08:32", "that they're saying oh look it what you", "08:34", "know he doesn't have a plan P implying", "08:35", "that it's either this deal which even", "08:37", "our European allies say is inadequate", "08:39", "right or it's a military conflict and", "08:42", "that's kind of what the previous", "08:44", "president was was all about we either", "08:45", "get this dealer we're having a military", "08:47", "conflict no there's other things in the", "08:50", "works there's other options in that in", "08:51", "that decision tree", "08:53", "and so I think that's that's a false", "08:56", "premise and the other thing when they", "08:58", "talked about it over the past 24 hours", "08:59", "anyways is that well look at this is", "09:01", "gonna make it harder to get a deal with", "09:03", "with Kim tell none from North Korea's", "09:05", "cuz he's gonna think that we don't we", "09:06", "don't support our deals well I look at a", "09:09", "different way I think that Kim jong-un's", "09:11", "gonna look at this and think okay", "09:14", "they're not gonna put up with an", "09:15", "inadequate deal right so he's gonna look", "09:17", "at it and say well yeah that because", "09:18", "nobody disagrees with the Iranian deal", "09:21", "they want to talk about they want to", "09:23", "talk about how look the Iranians are", "09:25", "complying with it well the Iranians are", "09:27", "complying with what they agreed to allow", "09:29", "in the deal right which is none of their", "09:32", "military sites the number of times", "09:35", "inspectors have have actually gotten on", "09:37", "and inspected a military site including", "09:39", "Parchin the most important military", "09:41", "facility in Iran since that deal was", "09:43", "signed in 2015 was zero haven't been", "09:46", "there because the Iranians didn't agree", "09:49", "to allow any of those sites in this deal", "09:52", "so that's like that's like saying that's", "09:55", "like saying if you're a serial killer", "09:56", "you'll allow the police to come in and", "09:58", "search your home but you can't go in the", "09:59", "basement right not that also a cult is", "10:02", "put their bodies in the basement but I", "10:04", "have you know I suspect that's the case", "10:05", "so anyway that's it's an interesting", "10:08", "thing and I guess I wanted to throw that", "10:09", "out there right off the bat because I", "10:11", "think Iran right now is consuming so", "10:12", "much of the oxygen for it for people out", "10:14", "there so people thinking that the reason", "10:16", "why we're backing out of the deal is", "10:18", "because the president's being", "10:19", "unreasonable and we're forcing well", "10:21", "you're saying it's a shit deal period", "10:24", "yeah I think the idea that we have to", "10:26", "stay in it because it's better than the", "10:28", "alternative and the alternative you know", "10:30", "being war is is not framing it properly", "10:35", "I don't think that doesn't make any", "10:36", "sense to me but I think that the fact", "10:39", "that the UK the the the French the", "10:41", "Germans have all agreed publicly that", "10:44", "it's an inadequate deal and needs to be", "10:46", "fixed that tells you something but it", "10:48", "also tells you that they have real", "10:50", "strong financial incentives for", "10:51", "continuing to do business in Iran they", "10:54", "and as do Russia and China frankly the", "10:56", "other signatories", "11:02", "[Applause]", "English (auto-generated)"]
