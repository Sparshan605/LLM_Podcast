"there my stupid little other wrestling", "31:47", "oh yeah good times these kids wrestle a", "31:50", "lot yeah it's a good way to grow up man", "31:53", "always just outside having a good time", "31:56", "yeah I guess so the Werner Herzog", "31:59", "documentary was really fascinating", "32:01", "because as you watch those people and", "32:03", "when they talk about like no depression", "32:07", "you know they're all happy they're", "32:09", "always laughing they love what they do", "32:12", "they enjoy what they do but even though", "32:14", "that's like everybody's goal right", "32:16", "everybody's goal right everybody's like", "32:19", "fuck that I'm not doing that", "32:20", "yeah it's that's a fascinating", "32:21", "conversation and of itself because you", "32:26", "know having been up there and stuff I'm", "32:27", "just like man this is an awesome way to", "32:29", "live if it was like my friends and my", "32:31", "family in that context it's like I would", "32:33", "probably choose that way of life but you", "32:37", "know then you find yourself here in", "32:39", "America and you're stuck on your phone", "32:40", "and you know and it's just so", "32:42", "unsatisfying that it's it's interesting", "32:44", "to experience both but it's kind of hard", "32:46", "to I mean I mean cuz you're in where you", "32:51", "are so my family's all here everybody's", "32:52", "all here we're not nomads you know right", "32:55", "but it's funny to have experienced that", "32:56", "way of life and almost think man that's", "32:58", "kind of what we're made for it's almost", "33:00", "better I wish I wish I could implement", "33:03", "that in some way you know here I'm aware", "33:07", "of that because people say it but I'm", "33:09", "not aware of it in the sense", "33:11", "I've never experienced like just", "33:13", "completely living I've hunted camped out", "33:15", "for a week at a time yeah yeah you start", "33:18", "to get a feel for it seems like when", "33:22", "there's no other option like that yeah", "33:23", "you're eating yeah we were eating", "33:25", "mountain house and yeah yeah yeah shot a", "33:28", "deer then we'd eat the deer right yeah I", "33:31", "know I you were speaking of which you've", "33:35", "read those like Quanah Parker and moving", "33:38", "books and stuff me too and now having", "33:41", "lived with those natives it's like", "33:42", "there's so much good there you see like", "33:46", "they really are happy people so there's", "33:48", "a giant difference between the people", "33:52", "who live in the village and the people", "33:53", "who live in the forest and people who", "33:55", "live in the forest you would genuinely", "33:56", "call like happy people like this is", "33:58", "they're knowledgable they're being", "34:00", "productive they're doing all this stuff", "34:02", "whereas when you go to the village it's", "34:03", "just like everybody's drunk nobody's", "34:06", "doing everything it's like just a total", "34:07", "wreck", "34:08", "especially villages that don't have any", "34:10", "reindeer herding connected to them", "34:12", "because they kind of don't have their", "34:14", "cultural context to remain connected to", "34:18", "so the so at least in the villages that", "34:21", "have reindeer herding the kids can go", "34:23", "out in the summer and live with the", "34:24", "reindeer herders and kind of experience", "34:26", "that and it gives them a source of pride", "34:29", "it gives them like the experience of", "34:33", "living in the forest becoming like kind", "34:35", "of really in touch with nature and all", "34:38", "that and whereas in the village it's", "34:40", "just kind of a dark hole everybody", "34:42", "drinks the in those native villages it's", "34:44", "like the statistic is that one out of", "34:47", "three people die of suicide homicide or", "34:49", "accident so it's just and you feel it", "34:52", "like I've got some stories of that", "34:53", "that's just brutal too but the the I", "34:57", "when I read those like you know empire", "35:00", "of the summer moon those nights and", "35:01", "books out and I grew up with a couple of", "35:03", "good friends that were Native American", "35:05", "and it really made me think like I", "35:08", "wonder if you could seeing how how well", "35:14", "how much of a difference it makes having", "35:16", "that culture intact to some degree like", "35:19", "I wonder if say on Pine Ridge you know", "35:22", "on some one of these one of these", "35:25", "reservations if you could almost", "35:27", "replicate something like that like if", "35:29", "you could maybe take the initiative to", "35:32", "like restore some buffalo herd use a", "35:34", "bunch of unused land that maybe the you", "35:38", "know government land or or tribal land", "35:40", "that's kind of unused restore herd and", "35:43", "then kind of bring back those nomadic", "35:47", "ways it's not like everybody would have", "35:48", "to live that way but from my own", "35:50", "experience watching places that have", "35:52", "that option you know that kind of that", "35:57", "are connected to that culture flourish a", "36:00", "lot more than the ones that didn't there", "36:02", "were Venki villages with no reindeer", "36:04", "herding and ones with and it was like", "36:05", "night and day it's fun and so it's like", "36:07", "I wonder if that would be anyway it's", "36:10", "something I've thought about it's the", "36:11", "same thing to think of but one of the", "36:14", "things that happened to the Native", "36:15", "Americans in this country right all the", "36:17", "pieces of land that they got for", "36:19", "reservations sucked yeah the trick that", "36:22", "the white man pulled for sure I wonder I", "36:24", "was right and I wonder if it I mean it", "36:28", "was worth as any of that land suitable", "36:30", "for raising like I'm sure some of the", "36:32", "lines like I wonder or I'm saying every", "36:34", "piece of land but yeah yeah it's not", "36:37", "really true but a lot of it know for", "36:39", "sure", "36:39", "Oakland why they said in Oklahoma and", "36:41", "the Dakotas they sounded some barren", "36:42", "barren barren land that was Comanches", "36:44", "were anyway you know before the white", "36:49", "settlers got here fucked everything up", "36:50", "yeah Oklahoma was probably pretty dope", "36:52", "right imagine seeing 13 million buffalo", "36:58", "roam in the plains well there's an", "37:00", "interesting story to that to like that", "37:02", "seems a little bit imbalanced as well", "37:04", "and there is Dan Flores who's a Dan is a", "37:09", "wildlife historian right and he wrote an", "37:12", "amazing book called coyote America", "37:15", "that's about it just really gives you a", "37:17", "really interesting understanding of how", "37:20", "weird the animal coyotes are yeah", "37:23", "they've spread out across the

can just just just drunk just", "48:42", "it's just insanity like but it's and", "48:45", "it's weird because then you take the", "48:46", "same people go into the woods they sober", "48:49", "up and it's just a night and day that's", "48:51", "so weird", "48:51", "so weird and then uh yeah it's buddy you", "48:55", "see the effects of it so like I was", "48:57", "telling you earlier it's pretty brutal", "49:00", "uh when I first went to over there there", "49:04", "was like a little you know a nice family", "49:06", "it was like Dasha and Artem you know", "49:08", "these and their two little

he slowly recovered", "49:51", "and then went back to his village", "49:53", "the drinking continued sure enough they", "49:55", "killed him they took his body too back", "49:58", "to the morgue which the the freezers had", "50:03", "broken right so it's in the middle of", "50:05", "the summer those bodies there but it was", "50:08", "a murder so they had to wait for the", "50:10", "police to come and investigate but it's", "50:12", "way out in the middle nowhere so it took", "50:14", "like a week and it's like a week later", "50:16", "it was just brutal go over there had to", "50:20", "you know pick up this guy was your buddy", "50:22", "and his wife is helping me like dressed", "50:25", "this body cuz they're basically like", "50:27", "okay we're done with the investigation", "50:28", "you can go bury decomposing yeah yeah I", "50:32", "mean and the wife is helping you yeah", "50:34", "and the wife's helping we like took care", "50:37", "of his body like pick him up and like", "50:39", "skin slips off and all that stuff and", "50:41", "then take care you know we took her and", "50:46", "buried it and buried him it was pretty", "50:49", "rough and then a year later I come back", "50:52", "she", "50:52", "gotten remarried you know kind of", "50:54", "starting her life again turns out he", "50:56", "hangs himself not long afterwards so", "50:59", "again it's this woman has lost two", "51:01", "husbands and her daughter she just her", "51:04", "and her son oh I just found out a little", "51:07", "while ago she got too drunk passed out", "51:09", "in the snow and died so now it's just", "51:11", "the one son left from this whole family", "51:14", "and you like hear those stories often up", "51:17", "there it's like really rough you know", "51:20", "but that's balanced with what is could", "51:22", "be so beautiful it's like such a", "51:24", "juxtaposition because you're out in this", "51:26", "life where you have like people are", "51:28", "happy you know ultimate freedom and", "51:31", "they're doing great but when they but", "51:35", "the village in the alcohol just does", "51:37", "this whole other thing to them and it's", "51:39", "like these people who are so beautiful", "51:41", "so nice so friendly you know so open do", "51:45", "you but you just see them suffering so", "51:49", "much from this scourge it's like man", "51:51", "it's brutal it's crazy that the scourge", "51:54", "doesn't extend to the people that live", "51:55", "in the forest yeah once they get out in", "51:58", "the woods you know they don't have the", "51:59", "alcohol available and they don't but", "52:02", "even if they did do you think they would", "52:03", "drink it it seems like yeah they usually", "52:04", "drink it you know like when they go to", "52:06", "the village they get it and then they'll", "52:08", "take go out to the woods and they'll", "52:09", "drink for a few days until it's all gone", "52:11", "and then it's also I think it's a", "52:14", "genetic thing that's been a good", "52:17", "quitters that there's that hypothesis", "52:20", "like that maybe it is because if people", "52:22", "have been introduced to alcohol more", "52:24", "recently that they're not yeah I'd you", "52:27", "know can't process it as well but that", "52:29", "was a thick could also there could also", "52:31", "have the explanation it's probably a", "52:32", "combination of both that when you do", "52:34", "like have a people that are largely", "52:37", "stripped of their culture and they're", "52:39", "like you know because even the Evenki is", "52:41", "cool their way of life is you know they", "52:43", "had you know 70 years of communism where", "52:47", "they came in and they collected all the", "52:48", "best reindeer herders and said that they", "52:51", "were like cool ox or well you know like", "52:54", "the bourgeois because they have too many", "52:56", "reindeer sent them all to prison you", "52:57", "know like collectivized all these", "52:59", "reindeer herds these family herds they", "53:02", "turned into like government herds you", "53:04", "know so it's been like their cultures", "53:05", "not", "53:06", "completely intact and it's like well", "53:09", "there might be enough cause just from", "53:11", "that kind of thing to explain some of", "53:15", "the alcoholism but I imagine it's a", "53:16", "combination of both you know yeah I've", "53:18", "always wondered that about the Native", "53:20", "Americans sort of like how much of it is", "53:23", "despair and being removed from their", "53:25", "normal nomadic way of life right how", "53:28", "much of it is just the fact that they", "53:31", "don't have the genes to process alcohol", "53:33", "because they didn't evolve with alcohol", "53:35", "yeah you know there's a story of Cynthia", "53:37", "Ann Parker yes on the wall out there", "53:39", "whose Quanah Parker's mother she was", "53:43", "kidnapped by the Comanche when she was", "53:45", "nine hmm and then recaptured by the", "53:47", "Texas Rangers I think was the Texas", "53:50", "Rangers when she was like 30 with a", "53:53", "child and she was begging to go back to", "53:56", "the Comanches she did not want to live", "53:58", "and she found the way of living that the", "54:01", "settlers had was just pathetic", "54:03", "you know the the command she lived in", "54:06", "the world where everything was magic and", "54:08", "like the sky was a god the wind worship", "54:11", "nature you lived off the land right", "54:13", "followed the buffalo herd

right it's this a", "54:25", "Drex position of ultimate freedom in", "54:27", "this beautiful way of live versus like", "54:29", "you're in the village in this little", "54:30", "house you know these people are never", "54:32", "gonna be good like in Russian society", "54:34", "because they live in some remote village", "54:36", "no internet nothing you know like yeah", "54:39", "and then but they're also the ones that", "54:41", "aren't connected to their way of life", "54:43", "are also not going to be great at Vinci", "54:45", "because they've just lived in this", "54:46", "little house

something that draws people to", "55:00", "that way of life well live like that", "55:03", "it's very satisfying absolutely and as", "55:05", "my from my own experience like yeah I'm", "55:07", "not a
