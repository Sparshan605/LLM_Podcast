"136:04", "they don't that 10 count there's", "136:06", "something about that 10 count it's great", "136:08", "because it makes for moments like Tyson", "136:10", "Fury rising off the deck to win the rest", "136:13", "around with Deontay Wilder in that 12th", "136:15", "but it also it gives you a brain a false", "136:18", "sense of recovery like you're fucked man", "136:21", "you really probably
