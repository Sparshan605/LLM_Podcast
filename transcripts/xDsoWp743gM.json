better and we still used to fix it", "07:41", "well what he does it's a technical skill", "07:43", "it's a skill so he does he has a few", "07:45", "different exercises to help you correct", "07:46", "it so you put a banner on your knees and", "07:48", "you kind of push out on the band but", "07:50", "really what we do is we'll make George", "07:51", "do a lift or a jump film it send it to", "07:53", "Kelly and he'll tell us how aligned we", "07:55", "are and what directions to go so he kind", "07:57", "of coaches us on how to avoid this fault", "08:01", "however really at the end of the day", "08:02", "it's about keeping your knees turned to", "08:04", "the outside hmm I used to walk up the", "08:06", "stairs and have knees in my pain in my", "08:08", "knee you ever have that when you walk", "08:10", "upstairs no I just have pain in my knee", "08:12", "walking up the stairs and from stairs", "08:14", "just from walking up stairs and I didn't", "08:15", "know why and then I read his book and", "08:17", "he's like look when you walk up a step", "08:18", "you got to keep your toe straight and", "08:19", "turn your knee out I was like really and", "08:22", "I started doing that my pain was gone", "08:24", "immediately keep your toe straight", "08:26", "straight like toast or yeah and turn", "08:28", "your knee out turn your knee to the", "08:29", "outside so he says look this is your", "08:31", "this is your ACL see this here this is", "08:35", "your ACL cross it your seal okay that's", "08:37", "a seal you put it in your kneecap that's", "08:39", "that's your knee when you turn your knee", "08:41", "to the outside look it tightens it up", "08:42", "mm-hmm that takes away all the slack so", "08:44", "what happens when you're going up the", "08:46", "when you're going up the stairs your", "08:47", "your your ACL is just jiggling around", "08:50", "and getting sheared and when you tighten", "08:52", "it", "08:53", "you go up you're secured so you call it", "08:55", "call secreting torque he's a brilliant", "08:57", "book - brilliant guy so even when you", "09:00", "run hills you should do that absolutely", "09:02", "should always be aligned whenever your", "09:03", "body is under pressure or stress whether", "09:05", "you're wrestling or what not you should", "09:07", "always have torque so like grab your", "09:10", "shirt like this okay grab your shirt", "09:11", "okay this is an example in the book", "09:13", "excellent example so now grab the the", "09:14", "shirt and twist it here great torque now", "09:17", "look you have a much more stable grip", "09:19", "you know a judoka is always gonna grab", "09:21", "the lapels and twist them right so when", "09:23", "you grab the bar let's you're gonna do a", "09:24", "bench press maybe you know it's not the", "09:26", "best exercise or not but the principles", "09:27", "still at work when you grab the bar you", "09:30", "should be torquing the bar almost sure", "09:33", "when you're doing push ups your hands", "09:34", "are on the mat and you're torquing mmm", "09:36", "even though your hands are not turning", "09:37", "literally you just torquing right when", "09:39", "you do that you feel that all the slack", "09:40", "is eating up there's no more slack", "09:42", "there's no more trampoline effect you", "09:45", "know there's no more jiggling", "09:46", "everything's tight the system is tight", "09:47", "and it's very very important that the", "09:49", "system be tight and that the weight be", "09:50", "on the muscles hmm so if you're properly", "09:53", "aligned when you're doing a maneuver the", "09:55", "weight is on the bone not on the tendons", "09:59", "so if you put your put your weight like", "10:01", "this on your fingers you'll see that the", "10:02", "bone is carrying the way if you bend if", "10:05", "you bend your bones here look if your", "10:06", "unaligned and you start putting pressure", "10:07", "now you see your muscles over time so", "10:10", "when I'm carrying weight I need to I", "10:12", "need to have it on my bones and or my", "10:14", "muscles never on the tendons and", "10:16", "ligaments they say that with backpackers", "10:18", "you know what backpackers do they they", "10:21", "keep their legs as stiff as possible and", "10:23", "they take short like sort of short steps", "10:26", "like guys who are Mountaineer guys they", "10:29", "don't take like big high steps they kind", "10:32", "of keep their legs stiff and they walk", "10:33", "with their skeleton right if you know", "10:35", "what their scales see me I'm sitting on", "10:37", "this chair this chair has no muscles but", "10:39", "it's holding me up because of the", "10:41", "structure structures the type of", "10:43", "strength so if you take an egg and you", "10:45", "try to squeeze it in a certain way you", "10:46", "can't break it you know you ever seen", "10:47", "that experiment why because you're", "10:49", "actually trying to crush a cylinder to", "10:51", "crush a similar that takes a tremendous", "10:52", "amount of force however to break a stick", "10:54", "in half takes a very little amount of", "10:55", "force why and I was a lot to do with the", "10:57", "structure if you're trying to compress", "10:59", "matter on itself it won't it won't take", "11:02", "a tremendous amount of force to do that", "11:03", "jimena must tremendous amount of power", "11:06", "however if you want to separate the the", "11:09", "material by bending it at the middle is", "11:12", "very easy but to compress it the", "11:13", "compress material on itself it takes", "11:15", "will take a tremendous amount energy", "11:16", "right so anytime you're going outside of", "11:19", "your alignment using things to compress", "11:21", "yeah that's why it makes so much sense", "11:22", "to keep your legs straight when you're", "11:24", "hiking it's like a horse that sleeps", "11:25", "right he's sleeping if he aligns his", "11:27", "legs perfectly straight he's using", "11:29", "structure to hold him up instead of", "11:31", "muscular strength so I mean I remember", "11:34", "yeah you had him on the show and you", "11:35", "guys had a very interesting conversation", "11:38", "and he was talking about front squatting", "11:40", "will make you have a great guard but I", "11:42", "think you guys miss misunderstood each", "11:43", "other actually because you were like now", "11:45", "front squatting has nothing to have a", "11:46", "great garden right and I agree with both", "11:48", "of you but I think you guys were not", "11:49", "talking about the exact same thing he's", "11:51", "talking about having the mobility to", "11:53", "squat down really low mm-hmm in the", "11:56", "front squat will help you regard not", "11:58", "necessarily having a big lift but not", "12:01", "necessary hundred pounds in the front", "12:03", "squats gonna make you a great garden", "12:04", "player that that's irrelevant he would I", "12:06", "think what he was talking about was have", "12:07", "incredible mobility in your hips", "12:09", "you ever see a child pick up something", "12:11", "off the floor like a newborn baby he's", "12:13", "gonna get into this perfect perfect", "12:15", "squat well if you if you look at guard", "12:16", "players the best guard players always", "12:18", "have incredible flexibility in their", "12:19", "hips right because I always tell people", "12:21", "the higher you can bring your hips to", "12:23", "your chest the harder it is for me to", "12:25", "pass your guard like if you're one of", "12:25", "those guys where your knees like this", "12:27", "you know you're trying to regard and", "12:28", "your knees thus far it's the space for", "12:30", "me to pass your guard is huge giant yeah", "12:32", "but if you can bring this foot behind", "12:33", "your head and your hims", "12:35", "it's the window the space that I need to", "12:37", "cross to get to SCI control is so small", "12:39", "yeah he has excuse me one of his", "12:43", "students named Shawn Bollinger and he", "12:44", "has crying I've seen it I've seen him", "12:47", "it's crazy yeah he do double Lotus oh", "12:50", "yeah and literally take his legs and put", "12:52", "him behind his head yeah I mean you can", "12:54", "just pull his legs back how many how", "12:56", "many great guard players have you seen", "12:57", "who can do that so I'm like like Orion", "12:59", "Hall for instance and I'm yeah Keenan I", "13:02", "mean they have this flexibility to them", "13:04", "passing the guards becomes very it's", "13:06", "almost impossible almost impossible it's", "13:07", "like they just spin a little bit and", "13:08", "you're back in something again and", "13:10", "you're tied up and then you add in leg", "13:11", "locks and you're kind of fucked", "13:13", "anxiety's they're as they're spinning to", "13:14", "your leg while you're trying to pass", "13:15", "their guard and", "13:16", "yeah the hip flexibility is so paramount", "13:20", "in jiu-jitsu mm-hmm for bottom game", "13:22", "especially and it's so devastating when", "13:24", "you have a hip injury hip injuries and", "13:26", "you know I know guys who have had hip", "13:28", "replacements and it's like boy you know", "13:30", "then you're you're so severely limited", "13:32", "in what you can do afterwards", "13:34", "you got to never let it get there in my", "13:35", "opinion according to Kelly he says your", "13:37", "joints can last you 120 years like if", "13:40", "you take care of them he there's 2%", "13:42", "catastrophe meaning you got hit by a bus", "13:44", "okay that's something we can we can't do", "13:46", "anything about 98% of the time is", "13:48", "because you didn't take care of your", "13:49", "joints you haven't you haven't properly", "13:51", "used them and you let muscles get tight", "13:53", "for too long over a long period of time", "13:55", "so for

with me", "27:04", "they're like man you move so like you", "27:06", "know people like it's so seamless the", "27:08", "way you move and I I do thousands of", "27:10", "hours of live rolling and sparring but a", "27:12", "lot of those hours I would say 80% of", "27:13", "them is very light because I know the", "27:16", "terrain I just want to go through the", "27:18", "sequences as many times

"36:04", "intervene because at the end of the day", "36:05", "when are you 100% it really rarely", "36:08", "happens there's always something Brian", "36:09", "but the thing about getting knocked out", "36:11", "is that if you get knocked out two weeks", "36:14", "ago your odds of getting knocked out are", "36:16", "significantly higher", "36:17", "you know I know man it's it's it's crazy", "36:20", "and Dan Hardy is a really good strike oh", "36:22", "my god that left hook if it would've", "36:24", "touched George George would have been", "36:25", "out like a light he's got a crazy left", "36:27", "hook Plus George was hurt two weeks", "36:29", "before yeah thank God I worked out well", "36:31", "yeah I worked out great yeah it's the", "36:36", "balancing act of being a trainer

care", "36:45", "less like I could not care less but I", "36:48", "know that that guy he's on a one-way", "36:50", "track so if I'm telling him no hit the", "36:52", "brakes and he's saying we're going that", "36:54", "that break in harmony he's gonna create", "36:57", "a friction and create a doubt in the", "36:58", "fighter Ryan oh you are you all in are", "37:00", "you all in you know because if you're", "37:02", "not all in you're gonna scare your", "37:04", "fighter right there's that to consider", "37:05", "as well yeah when you look at the crop", "37:10", "of up-and-coming talent I mean this is", "37:13", "such a crazy time for MMA I think when", "37:16", "you look at these new guys like za beat", "37:18", "is one of my favorite guys to watch", "37:19", "because he's this this new crop of guys", "37:22", "that can do everything and they're", "37:25", "they're so high level by the time you", "37:27", "see them like the first fight I saw of", "37:30", "the beat in inside the Octagon oh you", "37:32", "know I've seen him on video before but", "37:35", "I'm alive alert holy shit is amazing but", "37:38", "he's not just amazing it's like this is", "37:40", "this is this next level like there's", "37:43", "another level like we've seen these", "37:44", "these elite fighters and everyone's", "37:47", "great at jujitsu everyone's got great", "37:49", "takedown defense everyone knows how to", "37:51", "strike but then you're seeing this new", "37:53", "flavor this like this ok the frequency", "37:56", "is now higher and it just seems to me", "37:58", "that every year or so there's these new", "38:01", "guys that jump through and you're going", "38:03", "ok well now the frequency is quite a bit", "38:05", "higher than it was before it's seamless", "38:07", "you know transitions are more and more", "38:09", "seamless mmm which is amazing yes I just", "38:11", "you're saying they're processing it", "38:13", "faster yeah and as they're doing the", "38:15", "takedown like dimitra's flowing into an", "38:17", "armbar takedown is even finish yeah and", "38:19", "you're like the next generation is", "38:20", "watching that mm-hmm and they've adopted", "38:22", "that now yeah so they're gonna flow into", "38:24", "a transition into an are like it's", "38:26", "getting it's getting more and more", "38:27", "seamless their computers are computing", "38:30", "faster and faster information yeah", "38:32", "they're thinking what they're gonna do", "38:34", "on the ground before it hits the ground", "38:35", "it's soon it is incredible and they know", "38:37", "what can be done now they've seen it all", "38:40", "possibility yeah so they have this", "38:42", "database in their mind of", "38:43", "accomplishments that have already been", "38:44", "achieved if the other fighters yeah I've", "38:46", "been awakened yeah it's fucking crazy", "38:48", "man when you stop to think about when", "38:51", "you first got involved in the sport and", "38:53", "then look at the level the fighters", "38:54", "right now there's not really a", "38:56", "commensurate sport in terms of like", "38:58", "modern mainstream sports where you've", "39:00", "people have achieved such an incredibly", "39:03", "high level of proficiency that so far", "39:06", "exceeds where it was a decade ago or two", "39:07", "decades ago it's really no no no", "39:09", "Harrison the growth rate is ridiculous", "39:11", "it's fuck is amazing and I don't think", "39:14", "it's a coincidence that the growth rate", "39:18", "in this sport is incredible and this is", "39:20", "the sport that has the most amount of", "39:22", "variables in terms of combat sports the", "39:24", "most amount of variables in terms of", "39:26", "what what a fighter can do to you there", "39:27", "are more ways to win than any other", "39:31", "combat sport obviously yeah and that's", "39:33", "why I find it's see the more you limit", "39:35", "us an athlete the more it's about torque", "39:37", "so for instance if you look at sprinting", "39:39", "if I were to race h\u00fcseyin bolt and I had", "39:43", "all the best trainers the best sprint", "39:45", "coaches and Husayn both had the most", "39:46", "mediocre mediocre sprint", "39:48", "coaches and we race when we're both 20", "39:51", "years old in our prime who's gonna win", "39:53", "you appreciate that question right he's", "40:02", "gonna win it for sure put us in MMA we", "40:05", "were the same way class same height", "40:06", "everything is the same I have the best", "40:07", "coaches he has the worst coaches who's", "40:09", "gonna win you're gonna fuck him out I'm", "40:11", "gonna kill him yeah because coaching now", "40:13", "is has a greater influence you know", "40:16", "sprinters say sprint coaches say we can", "40:18", "make you faster we cannot make you fast", "40:20", "you have to be born fast we could shave", "40:22", "off a few milliseconds yeah in MMA we", "40:25", "can make you I could take a regular Joe", "40:27", "and get them all the way up to UFC I", "40:29", "can't make him UFC champion I won't say", "40:30", "I can make him UFC champion to be UFC", "40:32", "champion you need a talent right okay", "40:34", "there's a there's a there's a talent er", "40:35", "to be in the 1% but to get you to UFC", "40:39", "because there are so many possibilities", "40:41", "there are so many ways to trick your", "40:42", "opponent or so many ways to turn the", "40:43", "tables on him mm-hmm the tork no longer", "40:46", "matters or torque is less significant so", "40:49", "if we're talking about football where", "40:51", "I'm only a lot to do these certain", "40:52", "maneuvers trickery is put to the side", "40:54", "you're not allowed to trick me but in", "40:57", "MMA you're allowed to trick me any which", "40:58", "way you want there are very few little", "41:00", "rules okay", "41:01", "but outside of these these barred rules", "41:04", "is barred maneuvers you can trick me any", "41:06", "which way you want so what happens is", "41:08", "you take your opponent to a maze you", "41:09", "take your opponent into a world where", "41:11", "torque doesn't matter so much and that's", "41:13", "why the more restrictive of sport is", "41:15", "let's say for instance boxing boxing is", "41:17", "more restrictive than my tie so the guys", "41:19", "would torque we're gonna do better in", "41:21", "boxing than they will necessarily in", "41:23", "Muay Thai cuz in what I can use more", "41:24", "trickery and I could be a little dweeb", "41:26", "and just beat you with clinching or I", "41:28", "could beat you with a trick kick or I", "41:30", "could beat you with a back a back kick", "41:31", "my friends is a back kick anybody can", "41:33", "generate knockout power with a back kick", "41:34", "however with a right cross or a left", "41:36", "hook not everybody's gonna have that", "41:38", "bone-crushing power however if you teach", "41:40", "somebody how to throw a proper backache", "41:41", "which you know cuz you got the best back", "41:43", "kick in the game you could teach a", "41:45", "regular Joe in a few years how to", "41:47", "generate knockout power so now he has", "41:49", "that element on the table so because MMA", "41:53", "is so you know there's so few rules we", "41:58", "have a greater environment for the", "42:00", "intellect to", "42:02", "Shyne mmm you said something once to one", "42:05", "of your fighters in between rounds and", "42:06", "they really stood out you said I want", "42:08", "you to overwhelm his mind with", "42:10", "possibilities like you're overwhelming", "42:13", "him you're making him think about all", "42:15", "the potential variables that are coming", "42:17", "his way right like that is a great way", "42:18", "to put it and we talk about variety so", "42:22", "everybody is looking for a pattern if I", "42:25", "do a jab jab cross and I do it three", "42:27", "four times the fourth time you're gonna", "42:29", "see it it's gonna be slower to you why", "42:31", "because your body is gonna your brain is", "42:33", "again this is all hypothetical this is", "42:35", "just my personal experience I'm basing", "42:36", "this on my own personal experience when", "42:38", "somebody does something to me a second", "42:39", "or third time I see it personally I feel", "42:42", "like I'm perceiving it slower and I have", "42:45", "a window to counter you however when I", "42:47", "spar with George George is the trickiest", "42:49", "guy I'll tell you why because he has so", "42:51", "many tricks he has so many attacks that", "42:54", "he barely rarely ever shows you the same", "42:57", "trick twice and he's the master at", "42:59", "adapting so if you do a trick on him", "43:01", "once and you tried again he's gonna shut", "43:04", "you down look at all his rematches when", "43:06", "he rematch BJ Penn when he much Matt", "43:08", "Hughes every time the rematch was", "43:09", "progressively worse the third time he", "43:11", "fought my Hughes was even easier don't", "43:13", "try the same trick on George twice", "43:14", "you're gonna get crushed and I think", "43:15", "that's why Mia as a martial arts I", "43:17", "developed like a lot of variety of skill", "43:19", "because every week I'd have to come up", "43:21", "with a new trick or George you're gonna", "43:22", "shut that down and so after ten years", "43:24", "I'd be started becoming like a trickster", "43:25", "you know what other magic trick can I", "43:27", "get away with one time yes next week I", "43:29", "needed a new trick because it won't work", "43:30", "on him again he's gonna get wise to it", "43:32", "he's a master at that it might work once", "43:35", "on him the second time you're gonna get", "43:36", "shut down well I feel like that was a", "43:39", "factor in Dominick Cruz losing to Cody", "43:43", "Garber exactly because those alpha-male", "43:45", "guys had seen that track so many times", "43:47", "like okay we can like apparently Justin", "43:50", "Buckholtz can imitate dominoes and", "43:52", "training like a weird herky-jerky exact", "43:55", "with the hands down exactly he's a weird", "43:57", "one man he's one of the weird at all the", "43:59", "fighters I've ever watched fight Dominic", "44:01", "might be the weirdest I agree cuz you", "44:03", "look at him and East first of all he's", "44:06", "such a he's a great guy", "44:08", "very smart guy but he's crazy and in the", "44:10", "weird way it's like one of the things", "44:12", "that he says like I'm just not very", "44:13", "flexible", "44:14", "what do you say why are you even saying", "44:17", "that like that doesn't make any sense to", "44:18", "me like why not get more flexible it's", "44:21", "like it's not like saying like oh I'm", "44:24", "too short", "44:25", "well you can't throw so you're locked", "44:27", "you know you're never gonna play", "44:28", "basketball mmm saying I'm not flexible", "44:31", "enough easy fix that's the dumbest thing", "44:33", "to ever say it's like I mean it's so", "44:36", "it's so much more dumb then I'm not", "44:38", "strong enough well if you gained weight", "44:40", "from muscle you might not be in that", "44:42", "weight class anymore you got a real", "44:44", "problem there but I'm not flexible", "44:45", "enough you got zero problem you just", "44:47", "have to stretch yeah but he doesn't", "44:49", "stretch right we were talking about", "44:51", "jujitsu techniques it's like I can't", "44:53", "play

translate it to a level", "63:49", "of speed so I need George to change", "63:52", "level and explode in a fraction of a", "63:54", "second so that's why I like things like", "63:56", "sprinting track

squatters if I take you and I make", "64:21", "you squat a slow squat down and up that", "64:24", "I'm training you like a tow truck right", "64:26", "then I'd your vertical jump your", "64:28", "vertical jump is gonna have gone down", "64:29", "after you've done six months of", "64:30", "squatting it's not gonna have gone up", "64:32", "why because you're training like a tow", "64:34",

make you do Olympic lifting you know", "64:44", "Olympic lifting is very fast it's 1", "64:46", "point 5 second contraction on the", "64:47", "hamstring 1.5 second and there's a", "64:51", "certain

"I've never heard it put that way and I", "65:09", "like that thought I like the thought", "65:11", "process behind it I think there's a", "65:14", "there's a lot of people that are using a", "65:16", "lot of plyometric drills now and it's", "65:19", "way more common when you see like", "65:21", "training montages so from you guys", "65:23", "hopping over hurdles but I really have", "65:25", "to think that George is one of the first", "65:27", "guys I ever saw do that stuff yeah I", "65:28", "still do you want to train like a tow", "65:30", "truck or do you want to train up a", "65:31", "Ferrari which one you want to be do you", "65:33", "want if you look at Demian Maia", "65:34", "he's like a tow truck yeah he's stiff", "65:37", "even when he throws a punch she's very", "65:38", "stiff yeah why because years of ghee", "65:40", "training is like yeah I've trained my", "65:43", "body to make an isometric hold and now", "65:45", "your body behaves isometrically why are", "65:47", "you asking you to do anything different", "65:49", "right", "65:49", "I never asked my body to do something in", "65:51", "practice that I don't want it to do on", "65:52", "fight night hmm so I do believe", "65:54", "squatting is important squatting is", "65:56", "important to develop a general strength", "65:58", "so let's say for instance you're always", "66:00", "doing plyometrics while you might have", "66:01", "an overuse injury certain muscles are", "66:03", "not being activated you go on the squat", "66:05", "rack you do a few squats and I believe", "66:07", "you gotta do squats not not too heavy", "66:10", "about 70% of your max and do it fast you", "66:12", "still get all the benefits what about", "66:15", "lowering it", "66:16", "lowering it how do you lower it fast or", "66:18", "do you lower it lower it fastened up", "66:20", "fast", "66:21", "really yeah so for instance Fred", "66:22", "Hatfield he's probably said it best okay", "66:24", "he said he's the first man to officially", "66:26", "squat a thousand pounds he said look", "66:28", "throw a baseball throw a throw a paper", "66:31", "you take a paper you crumple it up and", "66:33", "you throw it it's too light for it to to", "66:35", "go anywhere you throw it really hard", "66:37", "because it's so light that doesn't go", "66:39", "anywhere take a bowling ball or bowling", "66:41", "balls too heavy you throw it doesn't go", "66:43", "anywhere you take a baseball that's the", "66:46", "right amount of resistance it's the", "66:47", "right amount of weight now you're gonna", "66:49", "apply more force on that baseball you're", "66:50", "gonna get more force out of it why it's", "66:52", "that it's in the Goldilocks range so for", "66:55", "instance let's say let's make it really", "66:57", "simple okay let's say you weighs zero", "66:58", "pounds I put you on a scale you weighed", "67:00", "0 pounds you have a bar on your back the", "67:02", "bar weighs 100 pounds okay so we're", "67:05", "looking at the scale now the scale says", "67:07", "100 pounds the bar is on your back let's", "67:10", "take away your weight just to make it", "67:11", "really simple you go down and up the", "67:14", "scale is gonna read 101 that's the", "67:18", "minimum amount of power you have to put", "67:20", "into that that that scale for it to come", "67:22", "up so when you go down the scale is", "67:25", "gonna say 100 100 as you come up it's", "67:27", "gonna say 101 for it to have a positive", "67:29", "trajectory you have to apply 101 pounds", "67:32", "upwards so sorry downwards and then the", "67:34", "reaction will be upwards if I put that", "67:37", "weight on my back if I put 70 pounds if", "67:40", "I take 70% of the weight and I go up and", "67:43", "down really fast on the scale the scale", "67:45", "is gonna read 101 minimum for me to if I", "67:49", "explode up really fast it's gonna read", "67:52", "100 100 200 3 now I got the benefits of", "67:55", "a maximum contraction let's say 100", "67:58", "pounds was a maximum you can lift but I", "68:00", "don't have the weight of a hundred", "68:03", "pounds on me mmm you know somebody who", "68:05", "who really made this popular is a louis", "68:07", "simmons he learned it from the russians", "68:09", "mm-hmm you know louis if you had on your", "68:11", "show yes he's a brilliant trainer he's", "68:13", "fascinating he's a he's a mind - he's", "68:16", "out of his mind we interviewed him as in", "68:18", "his gym really yeah in Columbus was", "68:21", "great he's a genius when it comes to", "68:22", "lifting yeah he's a genius he knows what", "68:24", "he's talking about man he read super", "68:25", "training I also read super training and", "68:27", "super training is about lowering the", "68:29", "rates to the right amount and doing a", "68:30", "plyometric with it you get the same", "68:32", "benefits as using maximum weight", "68:34", "but you don't get the side effects the", "68:36", "soreness the injury the red lightning", "68:38", "you don't get any of that so the", "68:39", "Russians found a great way to apply", "68:41", "maximum force on a bar but they also get", "68:44", "speed they're not training like tow", "68:45", "trucks they're training like Ferraris", "68:46", "that's actually where I got the term", "68:47", "from Lewis Simmons he really like", "68:48", "clarified it for me made it really", "68:50", "simple so like what kind of like say if", "68:53", "you could benchpress 315 pounds what", "68:56", "would you use use between 65 to 80", "68:58", "percent of that weight and they're just", "69:00", "real quick hmm boom you'll get the same", "69:03", "amount of resistance if you do it", "69:05", "quickly as if you had maximum weight on", "69:06", "it", "69:06", "hmm so he doesn't use maximum weight", "69:08", "except for once a week and the reason", "69:10", "why he explains it is easy says look you", "69:12", "have proprioceptors in your system", "69:14", "Probie receptors is like it's what tells", "69:16", "you if your arm is up or down if your", "69:17", "arm is bent to your chest if you are if", "69:18", "I close your eyes and I lift your arm", "69:20", "you're like you lifted my arm oh how do", "69:22", "you know that proprioceptors he says if", "69:24", "you if you put on a Mac let's say let's", "69:25", "say you're working with 75 pounds and", "69:28", "your maximum is 100 when you go to lift", "69:31", "that day and on the competition day when", "69:33", "you get a hundred on your bones your", "69:35", "body's gonna be like hey I've never felt", "69:37", "that amount of weight this ortho kinetic", "69:39", "reflex shut the muscles down we've never", "69:41", "felt that weight this is the narrative", "69:43", "that he gives us he says because you've", "69:44", "never felt that weight your body's gonna", "69:46", "it's not gonna allow you there's a", "69:47", "safety mechanism in your body it says", "69:49", "look this is this isn't we're not used", "69:50", "to this let's not take a chance and he", "69:52", "says if you get your body used to that", "69:54", "the ortho kinetic reflex will quiet down", "69:57", "and allow you to lift there's an inner", "69:59", "mechanism the safety mechanism in the", "70:01", "human body so he says to bypass that we", "70:03", "do heavy weights once a week to to to", "70:08", "numb that reflex so but the majority of", "70:10", "the work is done with light and sorry", "70:12", "lighter and fast", "70:13", "75% listen what do you think of like", "70:15", "Pavel taught Cellini's principles with", "70:19", "strong first principles of the like say", "70:22", "if you could do 10 reps of something you", "70:23", "don't do 10 you do 5 it's exactly right", "70:25", "hundred percent I've read all of the", "70:27", "Tetsu Lanza works almost all of them", "70:29", "he's brilliant trainer", "70:30", "I agree with that a hundred percent", "70:31", "outside of competition let's explain it", "70:33", "to people yeah ok so yeah let me okay so", "70:36", "let's say for instance let's say you", "70:38", "know I'm a big believer never being sore", "70:40", "you should train and the next day should", "70:42", "wake up feeling good okay no why how's", "70:44", "that possible", "70:45", "well because", "70:46", "look if okay that's great that's a good", "70:48", "example let's say let's see your energy", "70:51", "levels is talking about fit people by", "70:53", "the way right every human being every so", "70:54", "guys never worked out before maybe first", "70:56", "day first day never how's it possible to", "70:58", "worry about and not be sore no problem", "71:00", "okay here we go", "71:02", "let's say there's something called rate", "71:05", "of perceived exertion okay so let's say", "71:09", "I make you do pull-ups and let's say the", "71:11", "maximum amount of pull-ups you can do", "71:12", "the maximum amount of pull is 10 let's", "71:15", "keep a nice small number at 11 you", "71:18", "couldn't do 11 if I put a pointed a gun", "71:19", "at you you couldn't do 11 should I make", "71:24", "you do 10 pull-ups on our workout now", "71:25", "I'm gonna make you do 5 why because I'm", "71:28", "setting you up to work the next day the", "71:30", "next day we're gonna do 5 and the next", "71:31", "day we're gonna do another 5 and then", "71:32", "we're gonna do 6 when six is really easy", "71:34", "we're gonna do seven why if you count if", "71:37", "you did 10 pull-ups on Monday you're", "71:40", "gonna be sore still Thursday let's it's", "71:42", "really your max so Thursday you've only", "71:45", "done 10 pull-ups from Monday to Thursday", "71:46", "you've only done 10 pull-ups me I've",

trained", "71:57", "more I've trained way more than you so", "71:59", "let's say I go to jiu-jitsu practice I'm", "72:01", "doing jiu-jitsu every single day 3", "72:03", "rounds 5 days a week that's

still did", "72:12", "15 you're at 10 at the end of the year", "72:14", "I've done countless rounds more I may", "72:16", "have had so much more training than you", "72:18", "so how much training can we pack in in", "72:21", "the week that's the real question how", "72:24", "much volume can you expose your athlete", "72:26", "to so I always tell people look energy", "72:29", "I'm sorry exercise can produce energy so", "72:32", "let's say I'm feeling like a 7 out of 10", "72:34", "10 being I'm really like energized 1 I", "72:36", "was like a really lethargic feeling like", "72:38", "I need to lay down and 7 I'm feeling", "72:41", "good ok if I get up and I do a right", "72:45", "amount of exercise the right amount I", "72:47", "can feel like an 8.5 exercise can give", "72:50", "me a tonic

he did a great job", "104:29", "now when a guy like that is coming off", "104:31", "of a fight like the Darren Elkins fight", "104:33", "howdy how do you build him back up after", "104:35", "that fight well you know what I feel", "104:38", "like he was trying to do too much and he", "104:40", "wore himself out and Elkins is one of", "104:42", "those guys where if you give him a", "104:43",

is George George", "105:27", "recovers in the round we always talk", "105:28", "about recovering in the round and never", "105:30", "showing the guy your maximum point like", "105:32", "let's say

"push this pace a little bit more you're", "105:40", "gonna break there's no more reserves", "105:42", "however if you get to about 70% of your", "105:44", "fatigue and then you start circling and",

gonna", "106:02", "redline in a fight only at the last bit", "106:04", "of the fight am I gonna redline because", "106:06", "I have a reserve and case things go", "106:08", "wrong I have a reserve to explode out of", "106:09", "a position that I might need so the only", "106:12", "times our red line is if I'm in trouble", "106:14", "in the fight and I have to go all-in", "106:16", "because the fights can be over or it's", "106:18", "the end of the fight the guys who go", "106:20", "all-in and round one for me eventually", "106:22", "they will lose because some guys gonna", "106:23",

fighters are like that", "107:30", "right like Conor is kind of a good", "107:32", "example Conor is fantastic in the", "107:36", "beginning of a fight right but man he", "107:38", "gets to them third fourth and fifth", "107:39", "rounds and he takes it like the Nate", "107:42", "Diaz fight the second fight he becomes", "107:43", "human he turned and walked away from him", "107:45", "becomes very healing needed that break", "107:48", "so badly when you see that do you think", "107:51", "that that is a case of put and I don't", "107:53", "want you to give away too much because", "107:55", "you know George potentially wants to", "107:57", "fight Goliath right do you think that", "107:59", "that's a case of poor conditioning do", "108:04", "you think that is a lack of experience", "108:06", "in handling those moments because he's", "108:08", "so used to overwhelming people and", "108:09", "taking them out early what do you think", "108:11", "that is I think it's partly genetic", "108:14", "really yes because you see I call it a", "108:17", "touch of death you know he's got that", "108:18", "left hand it's the touch of death yeah", "108:20", "that touch of death comes at a cost", "108:22", "okay how do you have the touch of death", "108:23", "where does power come from okay well if", "108:25", "you look at Michael Hogan or we're", "108:26", "talking about earlier he has he has a", "108:27", "criteria for power to the best of his", "108:30", "knowledge is where he believes power", "108:31", "comes from okay so I can't teach Hussein", "108:34", "both to be powerful I can only make him", "108:35", "faster but where did that initial power", "108:38", "come from number one on the list number", "108:40", "one is where your muscle is attached to", "108:43", "your bone was genetic so Tyson hit so he", "108:46", "has a powerful left hook not because his", "108:47", "coach taught him out a hit on the hook", "108:49", "he could have hit a left hook like that", "108:51", "if you had a mediocre trainer it has to", "108:53", "do with the leverage of his bones so for", "108:56", "instance you know if I'm gonna imagine", "108:59", "how like a like a really heavy pole that", "109:01", "weighs 100 pound and I want to stand it", "109:03", "up well depending on where I grab it I'm", "109:05", "gonna have more resistance or less", "109:08", "resistance if I grab it near the end I", "109:09", "have more leverage so where your muscles", "109:11", "attach to your bone is gonna is gonna", "109:14", "dictate how much leverage you get out of", "109:15", "it second most important element is the", "109:17", "type of muscle fiber you have the type", "109:20", "so if you have a fast twitch muscle", "109:21", "fiber you can hold less oxygen but it", "109:25", "can twitch faster hence the name so if", "109:27", "you're a slow twitch muscle fiber guy", "109:29", "you can metabolize more oxygen but you", "109:32", "can't twitch as fast so there's a give", "109:33", "and take neck the", "109:35", "exactly so you have a guy Nick Diaz who", "109:37", "needs to knock her out with volume you", "109:39", "can't knock you out with one shot like", "109:40", "look at BJ Penn if Ron won he doesn't", "109:42", "knock you out likelihood of knock you", "109:43", "out and round two is less right Diaz is", "109:46", "the opposite the likelihood of him", "109:47", "knocking you on round three is higher", "109:48", "than 1:1 yeah because of the cumulative", "109:50", "at attack yeah", "109:52", "McGregor look at his stats it's all", "109:53", "round one knockout round one knockout", "109:54", "round round round two knockout he's fast", "109:57", "which high-leverage left hand yeah if", "110:00", "you take him into deep waters his fast", "110:03",

"110:11", "excited keep working keep working and", "110:14", "when you have nothing left I'm gonna put", "110:15", "you out you know there was such a", "110:17", "brilliant strategy it was it was so", "110:19", "obvious how much more efficient he was", "110:21", "exactly no and more relaxed Connor had", "110:24", "his moment early in the fight where he", "110:26", "hit him with someone", "110:27", "unorthodox punches and some some weird", "110:29", "movement but after a while was just I", "110:32", "found both of them had a brilliant", "110:33", "performance because when McGregor did to", "110:34", "go in his world Oh crowd was brilliant", "110:36", "it was brilliant just crazy crazy that", "110:39", "that it even happened", "110:40", "mhm really stop and think about it's", "110:42", "almost like the world got a magic trick", "110:44", "but it was unbelievable I want George to", "110:45", "fight me whether I keep bothered you", "110:47", "fight me whether you fight it he's like", "110:49", "it's crazy I know it's crazy", "110:50", "but I bet Mayweather would do it that's", "110:54", "what I'm saying might have to lose a", "110:55", "shitload of weight they'll find a", "110:57", "catchweight", "110:57", "do you think Mayweather is worried that", "110:59", "he's gonna get concussed he's fought all", "111:00", "the top punches in the world right he's", "111:02", "just gonna have to worry about George's", "111:03", "volume and reach but he can handle", "111:04", "himself and George can handle himself", "111:06", "but the whole world is gonna tune into", "111:08",

"it's gonna have to come from me with it", "111:18", "it's gonna have to there's another", "111:20", "big-money fight yep but is it a bit as", "111:23", "big a money fight that's the thing the", "111:25", "real big-money fight is in somehow or", "111:27", "another", "111:27", "McGregor convincing the world that he", "111:29", "could beat him in a second fight like I", "111:31", "know the weather yes oh how that that's", "111:33", "a heart sound so hard so we bought that", "111:35", "one already yeah George to fight", "111:39", "McGregor", "111:40", "there was the one thing of doing it in", "111:41", "the Octagon and doing it with small", "111:43", "gloves and no kicks", "111:45", "remember there was there was some talk", "111:47", "of that and", "111:47", "people were like war is his talk coming", "111:49", "from I don't know if it was legit or not", "111:50", "I mean all day know Dana said it's 100%", "111:52", "bullshit yeah but because the state", "111:55", "can't enforce that", "111:56", "so if McGregor wants to throw a kick", "111:58", "he'll throw a kick right it has to be", "112:00", "gentleman's rule do you remember when", "112:01", "that happened with Tim Sylvia and Ray", "112:02", "Mercer no Tim Sylvia fought Ray Mercer", "112:06", "and they had originally been scheduled", "112:08", "by the boxing match gentlemen's rules", "112:10", "but the Commission said they wouldn't", "112:12", "sanction the fight firstly because Tim", "112:14", "Sylvia doesn't have any pro boxing", "112:15", "experience Ray Mercer Olympic gold medal", "112:17", "as former world champion and they", "112:20", "decided to have an MMA fight when they", "112:22", "had a gentlemen's agreement to not throw", "112:24", "kicks Tim opens up with an inside leg", "112:27", "kick of course you see a fight I just", "112:31", "kick it starts off and Tim Sylvia", "112:34", "immediately this is go before this go", "112:36", "before this is that's the ko", "112:38", "if you go before this they open up and", "112:41", "Tim kicks them right away and the Gracie", "112:43", "raid puts his hands down you", "112:45", "motherfucker I can't believe this shit", "112:46", "oh that's right hmm and then he hit some", "112:51", "ways down he's just Hey oh you see that", "112:54", "one more time", "112:55", "boom I mean come on son and that's like", "112:59", "a fifty-year-old Ray Mercer at the time", "113:03", "that's why he gave that look yeah he", "113:06", "couldn't believe it it's like I thought", "113:07", "we weren't kicking man so they've made a", "113:09", "gentlemen's agreement and Tim Sylvia is", "113:11", "like yeah whatever dude but he paid for", "113:15", "that hmm I mean he got starched that was", "113:19", "that's it's also the difference in skill", "113:21", "level you see a guy like Ray Mercer", "113:23", "who's seen all these patterns and a guy", "113:26", "like Tim Sylvia is just so used to MMA", "113:29", "fighter striking mmm it's a different", "113:31", "different speed also it is how much does", "113:35", "it help fighters to cross-train", "113:37", "in these different disciplines and how", "113:39", "difficult is it to take those skills and", "113:42", "then to put them into their overall MMA", "113:44", "game I think it's beneficial if you do", "113:46", "it to a certain degree because if you go", "113:47", "too much let's say you're always spar", "113:48", "with pro boxers there's a distance", "113:50", "that's not realistic because NME you're", "113:52", "further away from each other yeah so", "113:55", "when I get to that distance the guy's", "113:56", "gonna grab me however because there's", "113:58", "more punches per second", "114:00", "it's more of an intensive training so if", "114:03", "you can deal with that speed of training", "114:05", "then later when I put you in animes own", "114:06", "it's slower a little bit so there's that", "114:08", "element there's a balancing act there's", "114:09", "a boxing with pro boxer but then there's", "114:11", "doing it too much then when you're", "114:13", "sparring with MMA fighter it's harder to", "114:14", "hit them a fighter than it is for me to", "114:16", "hit the boxer right because we're in a", "114:17", "different pattern we're a different", "114:18", "world I want to do just a bit of that", "114:20", "not too much is there are there any", "114:23", "patterns that people pick up in boxing", "114:26", "that become a real problem when you add", "114:27", "in elbows yeah yeah when you duck down", "114:30", "some guys just start okay you throw", "114:31", "overhand I'm gonna duck down dude you do", "114:33", "that once with me I'm throwing a left", "114:34", "kick right after my ran I'm throwing a", "114:35", "shallow right hand and the left kicks", "114:37", "coming upstairs and when you slip you're", "114:38", "slipping right into the kick John Jones", "114:40", "Daniel Cormier exactly I mean that was a", "114:42", "pattern that John had seen and they even", "114:44", "talked about it beforehand what Daniel", "114:47", "said don't think you're gonna hit me", "114:48", "with that left high kick hmm which is", "114:50", "kind of crazy you see how it went down", "114:52", "hmm yeah that's a weird thing when", "114:55", "people just develop a sort of pattern", "114:58", "that they just keep repeating over and", "114:59", "over again and then it's in sexual", "115:01", "mm-hmm you want to take it out now good", "115:03", "luck good luck taking it out it's not", "115:05", "that's one of the things that when you", "115:09", "see people learning technique one of the", "115:11", "more difficult things is to relearn", "115:14", "something once you learn it one way like", "115:17", "with kicking in particular when they get", "115:21", "tired or when they get nervous they", "115:23", "revert back to their old way of kicking", "115:26", "and you see it especially if they", "115:28", "learned it young yeah it's hardwired", "115:30", "yeah how do you get a guy out of that I", "115:32", "haven't been very successful like for", "115:34", "instance if I think a guy was been", "115:35", "kicking in Taekwondo his entire life and", "115:37", "then I try to teach him a Thai kick it's", "115:39", "not that easy it's really yeah that's", "115:40", "why I believe when you're young you have", "115:42", "to have a diversity you have to learn", "115:43", "how to kick like a tie like a Taekwondo", "115:44", "guy like a karate guy like a kickboxer", "115:46", "the variety and then you can go and out", "115:48", "there and you can morph your style you", "115:50", "could exchange from one style of kicking", "115:52", "to another mmm however if you've done 10", "115:54", "years of one-way and you were hardwired", "115:57", "that way it's very difficult almost not", "115:59", "worth it to redo it just let him kick", "116:01", "the way he kicks really yeah it's not", "116:03", "worth it not worth it no because you're", "116:04", "gonna treat him for so many hours then", "116:06", "he's gonna go in there he's gonna revert", "116:07", "back like you said when he's under the", "116:08", "pressure and the stress he's gonna", "116:10", "revert back to what he normally does", "116:11", "when he's a little bit tired", "116:13", "it's more efficient for him mmm so", "116:16", "you're asking him now to do something", "116:17", "new is there any way to rewire a", "116:19", "person's brain not that I know of not", "116:22", "nothing that not of course you can you", "116:24", "can change some of this behavior", "116:25", "absolutely mm-hmm but if it's hardwired", "116:27", "from a young age we're talking about", "116:29", "it's a long-term project do you have the", "116:31", "amount of time you could do it but it's", "116:33", "a lot of time and energy and it's", "116:35", "painful it's painful to undo an old way", "116:37", "yeah it's a lot of energy the guy will", "116:40", "feel tired

he did", "125:27", "with him I think it did your hamstring", "125:29", "did he don't have strain you can't", "125:30", "remember he didn't he didn't take", "125:32", "cadaver he took his own they do it both", "125:34", "ways both times the same way I think so", "125:37", "yeah I think so yeah if I remember", "125:39", "correct Matt Matt Brown just did", "125:42", "hamstring he just when he was

taking or not taking the idea", "126:05", "what happens with the cadaver is people", "126:07", "think that your your body takes it like", "126:09", "an artificial heart no or like a you", "126:12",

feeling", "126:22", "that it's stronger than it is early on", "126:24", "you're like yeah I'm ready to go I'm", "126:26", "ready to go and you start you mean", "126:28", "everybody wants to start rolling again", "126:29", "everybody wants to start training again", "126:31", "and so I think some guys just get in", "126:33", "there a little bit too early and they do", "126:35", "something and it pops and they go oh it", "126:37", "didn't take well is that really the case", "126:40", "or did you just put too much stress on", "126:42", "it too early on I thought the fear was", "126:44", "it can reject your body can reject it", "126:47", "I've heard of that but I think that's", "126:49", "extremely rare okay I think what what's", "126:51", "more common is that they say it doesn't", "126:55",

"127:13", "recovery process blew it out again it", "127:15", "happens really common", "127:16", "and then they're back to square one", "127:18", "again right it's all narratives I mean", "127:20", "even the even the I mean to explain", "127:22", "something it's it's really just it's", "127:25", "narrative that's where our explanations", "127:27", "are 99% of the time just narratives and", "127:29", "then to weed out narratives and not use", "127:31", "them is very difficult what do you mean", "127:33", "by that", "127:34", "I mean there is difference between", "127:36", "logical arguments empirical observations", "127:39", "and then there are narratives we tell", "127:41", "ourselves why things are happening", "127:43", "around us all the time and it's 99% of", "127:45", "the time it's wrong well we believe it", "127:46", "we tell ourselves that and to try to", "127:48", "work around that is actually quite", "127:49", "difficult so like for instance when the", "127:52",

gonna tell me", "157:09", "it's probably gonna land on heads or", "157:11", "tails yeah mm-hmm do you know that", "157:14", "logically or is it based on your history", "157:16", "with coins I know it
