10 years", "57:13", "is realistic white belt a black belt for", "57:16", "a regular person if you really train", "57:18", "hard and you really dedicate yourself", "57:19", "but freaks can get there

think about", "57:49", "it in terms of leverage guys with longer", "57:53", "limbs like Roger Gracie is a perfect", "57:55", "example he's a really tall long guy so", "57:58", "when the best jujitsu players ever they", "58:00", "can do things with those limbs that a", "58:02", "shorter person can't do in terms of like", "58:05", "leverage from joints and stuff like this", "58:07", "like there's the advantages to every", "58:09", "frame like there's a guy like who Samar", "58:12", "Paul Hara is a famous like tank of a", "58:14", "guys five seven two hundred plus pounds", "58:17", "and just rips guy's legs apart and he", "58:20", "uses this like short style to dive in on", "58:23", "people's legs and get him in heel hooks", "58:25", "and bars and rip their legs parties", "58:27", "terrifying", "58:27", "yeah and that that style heavily favors", "58:30", "being built like a little tank whereas", "58:33", "like that long like you are you're a", "58:35", "tall long guy you would have like good", "58:39", "Darce chokes good rear-naked good are", "58:42", "good arm bars good triangles you would", "58:44", "have lengthened leverage with that", "58:46", "length especially with triangles because", "58:48", "long-legged guys they can like sometimes", "58:51", "a guy like me with short legs like I'll", "58:52", "get my legs crossed yeah and I have to", "58:55", "adjust a lot to be able to cinch up by", "58:57", "triangle whereas you might be able to", "58:59", "just close it up right there so you'll", "59:01", "have like more opportunities for", "59:03", "triangles because the length of your", "59:05", "limbs have you would you have ever been", "59:07", "at a point in your in your career when", "59:10", "you were doing to just where you how", "59:12", "would you have been in the UFC like at", "59:15", "your prime like I have no idea", "59:17", "I'd have no", "59:18", "I would have had to have gotten way", "59:20", "better like when I was fighting I was", "59:22", "just kickboxing yeah I was kickboxing", "59:24", "and first of all first it was Taekwondo", "59:26", "and then with the kickboxing and by the", "59:27", "time the UFC came around like on the", "59:29", "ground I was useless or there's a", "59:32", "straight white belt I would get ripped", "59:34", "apart every day I would go to the gym", "59:36", "and if I if I tap to anybody like if it", "59:39", "was like a a week went by and I tapped", "59:41", "one guy be like whoa I fucking tap to", "59:43", "God yeah there wasn't that many people", "59:46", "doing it you know so I was going with", "59:48", "like there was a couple of white belts", "59:49", "maybe and then there was like blue belts", "59:51", "and purple belts and brown belts and", "59:53", "those guys would always tap me guys so", "59:54", "that's just how went for a long time", "59:56", "when you're you know unless you're some", "59:59", "kind of freak like some big-ass football", "60:00", "player or some like super athlete you're", "60:03", "probably not gonna be able to hold these", "60:05", "guys off they're gonna they're gonna", "60:06", "choke you now was it true you're gonna", "60:08", "fight Wesley Snipes that was way later", "60:11", "though way later that was a brown belt", "60:12", "by then and I'd been doing a lot for", "60:14", "beating him I don't know cuz we never", "60:18", "did everybody there's a real martial", "60:19", "artist I was real martial arts but he", "60:21", "doesn't know jiu-jitsu the thing that", "60:23", "must have been exciting though excited", "60:25", "yeah cuz I was thinking like I knew that", "60:28", "he was a real legitimate martial artist", "60:30", "like he throws kicks and punches and it", "60:32", "looks really good like he really does", "60:34", "know his shit but I also know he never", "60:36", "fought and there's a big difference", "60:38", "between throwing kicks and and I haven't", "60:41", "fought in a long time", "60:43", "but I probably fought a hundred times", "60:44", "yeah so I've been I've felt that nerves", "60:48", "I know what that's like it'll be crazy", "60:50", "as fuck to do it again that's what I was", "60:53", "thinking I mean it'll probably scare the", "60:54", "shit out of me but I think I know what", "60:56", "to do like I think I know how to like", "60:58", "get in there and start fainting and", "61:00", "start giving some movement see how he", "61:01", "reacts and then the worst case scenario", "61:04", "is like I'm like in a scramble I'm gonna", "61:05", "strangle this guy like this if this", "61:08", "comes to a scramble yeah because the", "61:10", "average person really doesn't know how", "61:13", "helpless they are until a jiu-jitsu", "61:16", "blackbelt grabs ahold of you and then", "61:18", "you just go oh shit like I'm helpless", "61:22", "because in a fight you really think like", "61:25", "you might be able to punch a guy like", "61:26", "maybe if he's from me and he's swinging", "61:28", "at me and I'm swinging in him maybe I", "61:29", "hit him first you really think", "61:31", "that but there's no swinging if it's a", "61:34", "jujitsu fight if you guys get into some", "61:37", "sort of a tussle and that guy grabs you", "61:38", "and trips you and boom and he's on the", "61:40", "ground with his hand on your jacket and", "61:42", "knee on your chest you're a dead man", "61:44", "you're a dead man because there's no", "61:47", "lucky shot yeah jiu-jitsu blackbelt is", "61:49", "just gonna close the distance like that", "61:51", "evil fucking crab and he's just gonna", "61:55", "your fucking neck and there's no way", "61:57", "you're gonna avoid it and there's no way", "61:59", "you're gonna survive it you're just not", "62:00", "going to that's why you don't fight", "62:02", "people like like you can't fight people", "62:04", "like I'm just you can't fight random", "62:06", "people on the streets like when you're", "62:07", "young that was the thing you could go to",

designed for so much and", "88:07", "it happened in 35 years you know like", "88:10", "like you just think about like our", "88:12", "parents right when we were growing it", "88:14", "the TV was black and white and in a wet", "88:16", "color and that was racing for them for", "88:18", "us there were no cell phones or Internet", "88:20", "yeah and then in our in like the last 35", "88:24", "years I'll I don't think you'll ever see", "88:25", "a technology boom like in this last 35", "88:28", "years so many advancements happen so", "88:31", "quick and that's why we today can't", "88:34", "react to them fast enough we don't know", "88:36", "like like now parents are doing like", "88:39", "parents that are our age or doing the", "88:41", "same things the kids are doing where my", "88:42", "dad

"we're still learning new technology and", "88:54", "now our kids are learning it with us and", "88:56", "there's no separation III agree and I", "88:59", "think it's definitely like untreated", "89:00", "territory but I disagree that that will", "89:03", "never see a boom and Technology like", "89:05", "we've already seen I think we haven't", "89:07", "even scratched us early yeah we haven't", "89:09", "even but when you have but I I guess I'm", "89:11", "saying things that change the world like", "89:15", "there was no internet Joe do now this", "89:17", "isn't that in my mosque is working on", "89:19", "called neural link and I don't know", "89:22", "exactly how this works", "89:24", "II wouldn't exactly explain it but the", "89:27", "concept is about increasing the", "89:29", "bandwidth between human brain activity", "89:31", "and information somehow or another to", "89:34", "get information quicker to you and have", "89:38", "you access it in a quicker manner I", "89:40", "don't know what the fuck that means", "89:41", "it's something you wear on your head", "89:43", "some dude just tried it Jamie there's an", "89:45", "article that just yeah some dude just", "89:48", "said I might or might not have tried", "89:51", "Elon Musk's neural link like he's kind", "89:54", "of like bound by silence but there is a", "89:58", "real possibility that think about what", "90:00", "here's here's how to look at it think", "90:02", "about Wi-Fi right mm-hmm", "90:04", "Wi-Fi is in this room we use it you can", "90:06", "access you could shut your phone off and", "90:08", "turn your Wi-Fi on and you'll be able to", "90:10", "access all the information in the", "90:11", "internet but where is that coming from", "90:12", "where is that it's in the air it's the", "90:13", "sky it's all around us if you can wear", "90:17", "thing that picks up on that in the same", "90:20", "way picks up on Wi-Fi in the same way it", "90:22", "picks up on cellular signals whether", "90:25", "it's 4G or 5g which is coming out soon", "90:27", "which is supposed to be in unstoppable", "90:29", "yeah if that can feed information", "90:33", "directly to your brain through something", "90:36", "that you wear just the way they do these", "90:38", "you know they have these electrodes they", "90:40", "put on your head and they send magnetic", "90:43", "pulses to different parts of the brain", "90:44", "helps people with traumatic brain", "90:45", "injuries helps people with depression", "90:48", "they've been able to do this by taking", "90:50", "these little things and they stick them", "90:51", "to your head and they they'd send this", "90:53", "pulsating magnet in there they could", "90:56", "already affect the brain with external", "90:58", "stimulation they already know how to do", "91:01", "that", "91:01", "if they can figure out how to do that in", "91:03", "a much more sophisticated way we are on", "91:05", "the edge of becoming cyborgs and it's", "91:08", "not far away we're talking about within", "91:11", "the next decade maybe two decades", "91:13", "there's gonna be something that changes", "91:15", "a person and makes you like if you're a", "91:19", "person with a limited education and no", "91:21", "phone think about how within but think", "91:23", "about how little access to the 100 sense", "91:26", "knowledge base you had now if you're a", "91:29", "person with limited access to", "91:30", "information and education but you have a", "91:33", "phone and that phone is online you have", "91:35", "everything so that changes everything", "91:38", "this person now can access all the", "91:41", "knowledge it's not perfect if you google", "91:44", "things some of the things are bullshit", "91:45", "yeah", "91:45", "some articles are dumb they don't make", "91:47", "sense but you have possibility of", "91:50", "finding all the information so now in", "91:52", "the future I think that as going that's", "91:56", "going to be escalated and it's going to", "91:57", "be escalated exponentially there's going", "91:59", "to be some new leaps and Technology that", "92:02", "happen that guys like you and I that", "92:04", "don't work in the field we're not we're", "92:05", "gonna see it coming and as people are", "92:07", "working on these things right now and", "92:08", "they're competing with people in China", "92:10", "and Russia and all over the world that", "92:12", "are also working on these technologies", "92:13", "and they're gonna get through and", "92:15", "they're gonna make something and that's", "92:17", "something is going to change reality as", "92:19", "we know it and it's probably right", "92:20", "around the corner the same way cell", "92:22", "phones and the internet changed our", "92:24", "reality as compared to our parents this", "92:26", "is gonna change but", "92:28", "thing is it I I get that your brain gets", "92:31", "it right away but I don't know how it", "92:33", "worked but but let's say your brain gets", "92:35", "it you put this machine on like this and", "92:37", "then it sends it straight to your brain", "92:38", "what's the difference of that it besides", "92:41", "quicker than you being on a computer and", "92:43", "looking up you're still getting the same", "92:44", "so I don't think that's the case but", "92:46", "you're giving the same information don't", "92:47", "think that's how it works what does this", "92:49", "guy say this is an April Fool's joke", "92:51", "it's an April Fool's joke Oh what is the", "92:54", "title the article you know I must might", "92:56", "have let me try a neural link post but", "92:58", "oh really", "92:59", "but let's say it I know you don't know", "93:01", "about but let's say you put on a device", "93:03", "and all the information goes to your", "93:05", "brain mm-hmm you're still getting the", "93:07", "same information maybe not what have you", "93:10", "ever seen someone using exoskeleton you", "93:11", "know next to no what is that exoskeleton", "93:14", "is like suit that you put on that's like", "93:16", "say if you work in a factory it allow", "93:17", "you to pick up much heavier things like", "93:19", "remember the movie aliens yes the Gorney", "93:21", "Weaver she's fucking up that thing she's", "93:23", "inside that robot yeah okay that's like", "93:29", "a giant robotic exoskeleton this is an", "93:32", "exoskeleton that they use for people", "93:33", "that are paralyzed guy helps them walk", "93:35", "okay they also are developing", "93:39", "exoskeletons oh that's a chair huh that", "93:43", "one has extra legs oh that's pretty dope", "93:45", "there's things that help people like", "93:48", "that gal right there is not a big person", "93:50", "but she can work in a factory and you", "93:53", "can carry things that are much heavier", "93:54", "than what you would ordinarily be able", "93:56", "to carry okay now they think that as", "93:58", "technology moves and improves they're", "94:01", "going to get to the point where they", "94:02", "develop what's essentially like an Iron", "94:04", "Man suit that's like an exoskeleton you", "94:07", "know the Iron Man suit like when he", "94:08", "wears that he's invisible he flies he", "94:12", "can smash things and pick things up and", "94:14", "throw things that's going that that that", "94:16", "is entirely possible that this is going", "94:19", "to be our future that there's going to", "94:20", "be suits that we wear that make us", "94:22", "impervious look at this guy's got one", "94:24", "that lets him fly around and then he's", "94:26", "got rockets that come out of it you", "94:28", "think the government would ever approve", "94:30", "that for us but you don't have a chance", "94:32", "it's not whether or not they improve", "94:34", "approve it it doesn't have anything to", "94:35", "do with them it has to do with the", "94:37", "technologists it has to do with the", "94:38", "scientists it has to do with the", "94:39", "geniuses that are creating these time", "94:41", "these", "94:41", "because they're gonna come in waves and", "94:43", "these

said so far", "95:18", "still to me is not bigger then not have", "95:22", "an internet well or that turn the door", "95:25", "but we don't know if that technology", "95:28", "thing that you can like

know it what if", "95:48", "that thought interfaces with your brain", "95:51", "in a way where it describes things maybe", "95:54", "in symbols or direct feed of information", "95:57", "through some
