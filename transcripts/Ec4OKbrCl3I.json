face to face today and say", "06:48", "what was your problem with me", "06:50", "I think there's four things my mind", "06:52", "number one he didn't really like me", "06:55", "stemming from I called him out on the", "06:58", "steroid thing you know where he said", "06:59", "it's impossible and this is where I", "07:01", "disagree it's impossible to test all UFC", "07:04", "athletes I said well that's not true you", "07:05", "saw to does it all over the world for", "07:06", "all kinds of athletes right you can do", "07:08", "it it's just expensive but let's just", "07:10", "call what it is you're a private", "07:11", "business you don't have to do drug", "07:13", "testing it's obviously they do it now so", "07:15", "you do it now yeah do it through you", "07:17", "sadhus yeah we're totally right yeah", "07:19", "so I was correct and now but that was", "07:20", "you know when Dana is wrong in an", "07:22", "argument and he's got this huge army", "07:23", "that follows him and he said I'd rather", "07:26", "hey I think his quote was better I'd", "07:27", "rather watch flies fuck than better ask", "07:29", "her fight you know I think he said", "07:31", "something like ambien takes Ben Askren", "07:34", "egos asleep yeah so the personal attack", "07:36", "started right so that that's number one", "07:38", "number two my fighting style is not", "07:40", "highly attractive but I also think", "07:42", "that's a little bit of fake news because", "07:44", "if you look at George st. Pierre is that", "07:47", "consistently novice Lee McGregor's", "07:49", "trumped him but only a couple of times", "07:50", "but if you could consistent basis George", "07:52", "st. Pierre is the number one draw of all", "07:53", "time he heavily relied on takedowns and", "07:56", "ground-and-pound I mean he didn't have a", "07:58", "finish in like five years or so let me", "08:00", "say what my take has always been on you", "08:02", "and that style is that it's important", "08:05", "and that it really really works yeah", "08:08", "well what you're able to do really works", "08:10", "and I've always said this and it was", "08:11", "proven son Saturday night in the steepy", "08:13", "Miocic Francis II gotta fight wrestling", "08:16", "is the most important part of MMA", "08:17", "absolutely to take the fight to the", "08:19", "ground obviously Steve Bay has a lot of", "08:21", "other attributes he took tremendous", "08:23", "punches in that fight I mean I know you", "08:24", "didn't get a chance to watch it but I", "08:26", "saw some highlights the holy shit I mean", "08:27", "the first round was chaos I mean you", "08:29", "Francis and God was a terrifying yeah", "08:31", "yeah Steve Baek took the shots use great", "08:34", "movement you striking of his own but", "08:35", "most importantly after a while", "08:37", "god is wrestling going and then once he", "08:39", "got in got it to the ground and gone I", "08:40", "didn't have any answers what to do well", "08:43", "your what you've been able to do to guys", "08:45", "like Douglas Lima who just fought Rory", "08:47", "MacDonald out of the Bellator title", "08:49", "really good fight chorus cough who's", "08:50", "another", "08:51", "fantastic fight who you know was beaten", "08:54", "a lot of really top-flight guys yeah", "08:55", "you're able to use your wrestling and", "08:57", "completely nullify all their striking in", "08:59", "offense yeah that's a huge part of", "09:01", "fighting fighting is not what's exciting", "09:03", "for people to watch fighting is what", "09:05", "actually works and you've been able to", "09:07", "do time and time again is take these", "09:10", "guys who looked like world beaters and", "09:12", "completely nullify their offense taken", "09:14", "to the ground and beat the shit out of", "09:16", "them yeah that's huge", "09:17", "that's very very important yeah", "09:19", "absolutely and so you know not so well", "09:21", "we can get back to the UFC thing but so", "09:24", "yeah I mean when I started fighting", "09:25", "right it was just like hey let's go", "09:27", "fight I didn't let me coaching and so I", "09:29", "didn't move to Duke's until to one foot", "09:32", "sook Rufus yes until 2010 I think so sir", "09:36", "no no 2011 I'm sorry cuz I was in", "09:38", "Arizona I was coaching it for Arizona", "09:39", "State University but when I moved there", "09:41", "I know", "09:42", "hey these there's a lot of elite", "09:43", "strikers in this gym I said I'm never", "09:45", "gonna be elite striker", "09:46", "but if no one can hit me they can't beat", "09:49", "me", "09:50", "they're not gonna outlast me they're not", "09:51", "gonna help grapple me they're not gonna", "09:53", "beat me if they can't knock me out", "09:54", "they're not gonna beat me plain and", "09:55", "simple so my whole goal was how do I not", "09:58", "get hit not I don't need to be a great", "10:00", "striker hitting people I just need to", "10:02", "not get hit if you can't knock me out", "10:03", "I'm gonna eventually get you on the", "10:05", "ground and I'm gonna beat your ass right", "10:06", "right and so that was kind of my whole", "10:07", "goal when I got in MMA is how do I not", "10:09", "get knocked out right and so you said", "10:12", "obvious ed but you know found a really", "10:13", "good way to do that and it added a lot", "10:16", "of longevity to my career where I wasn't", "10:18", "taking damage that a lot of other people", "10:20", "were taking and I think there's also a", "10:22", "lot of other things to being a really", "10:24", "high level wrestler that you know", "10:26", "besides obviously you can control where", "10:27", "the fight happens right but there's a", "10:29", "lot of other things that high level", "10:31", "wrestling provides us right that came", "10:33", "from that world that other disciplines", "10:36", "don't get you know a lot of competition", "10:38", "we compete thousands of times right how", "10:40", "to get our mind right these wrestlers", "10:43", "are just strong any there's just a", "10:45", "different strength I just actually I got", "10:46", "to go work out with charm bros last week", "10:47", "cuz Midtown world champ and it's like", "10:50", "you forget how strong wrestlers are like", "10:52", "you grab them you're like good god this", "10:54", "guy is like you know I don't feel that", "10:56", "from MMA people I grab him and I'm like", "10:58", "everywhere it's like there's nowhere", "11:00", "he's weak very very disciplined right", "11:03", "because wrestlers like we've been", "11:04", "the system from you thrust into high", "11:06", "school Russ into college us and we're", "11:08", "under you know coaches and have a very", "11:10", "strict training plan and understand how", "11:11", "to put a training regimen together where", "11:13", "a lot of other martial arts don't have", "11:15", "that kind of structured system so I", "11:17", "think there's a lot of advantages that", "11:19", "we as wrestlers have when we come into", "11:21", "mixed martial arts and if I could add to", "11:22", "that the intention is pure its pure for", "11:25", "competition because there's no financial", "11:26", "reward it's not a bunch of people that", "11:28", "are getting into wrestling because they", "11:29", "want to get rich it's a bunch of people", "11:30", "that really want to prove that they're", "11:32", "the best and so you have so many", "11:34", "top-flight guys that are incredibly", "11:36", "mentally strong feeding off of each", "11:39", "other knowing that they're going to be", "11:41", "competing against each other and almost", "11:43", "no financial possibilities except for", "11:45", "coaching well yeah there's a common now", "11:47", "so twenty eighteen to twenty two", "11:50", "thousand eight when I was wrestling and", "11:52", "then when I decided to make that jump to", "11:53", "MMA there is a lot better financial", "11:55", "structure for senior level athletes now", "11:57", "none of them are getting rich and", "11:58", "there's only about a dozen of them", "12:01", "making like a decent living right yeah", "12:03", "and so which is crazy there's thousands", "12:05", "of wrestlers exactly so your points", "12:07", "mostly correct but there are a handful", "12:09", "of top United States athletes now who", "12:11", "could do nothing but wrestle where when", "12:12", "I was in in 2008 when I was trained that", "12:14", "wasn't even the case I had to go do", "12:16", "camps I was coaching at Missouri so I", "12:18", "was doing other things in addition to", "12:20", "wrestling so like a top Olympic athlete", "12:22", "what what else would they do to make", "12:24", "money well so like in 20 in 2008 I was", "12:26", "doing a lot of camps right you travel", "12:28", "around the country do camps make money", "12:30", "coach a college team I was making money", "12:32", "that way so a handful of things that", "12:34", "like I it wasn't just wake up and train", "12:36", "every single day but the athletes of", "12:37", "today that you were saying now that's", "12:39", "what they're doing that's it coaching", "12:40", "and yeah bunch of different things here", "12:42", "no no no some of them don't have job you", "12:44", "say they just do it from where they", "12:46", "getting the money", "12:46", "Jordan Burroughs and James green for", "12:48", "example sponsorships are slightly more", "12:50", "lucrative than they were then", "12:52", "there's something called the regional", "12:53", "training center system which you know", "12:56", "most major colleges have one that's a", "12:58", "lot more lucrative and that's fund", "13:00", "raising right they're not they're not", "13:01", "earning money that the RTC people go say", "13:04", "hey rich guy would you like to fund this", "13:06", "program that'll help us develop Olympic", "13:08", "athletes sure okay right and then the", "13:11", "United States", "13:12", "USOC has slightly more funding given to", "13:15", "USA Wrestling than in the past well it's", "13:16", "the tragic story of John do", "13:18", "I mean that's literally why that whole", "13:20", "if people have seen that movie what yeah", "13:22", "that movie called Fox get Foxcatcher", "13:24", "yeah awful it's a crazy story of Dave", "13:27", "and Mark Schultz and this millionaire", "13:31", "billionaire crazy guy who wound up", "13:34", "shooting Dave Schultz and was this", "13:37", "weirdo guy that was running this camp", "13:39", "and these guys kind of got stuck", "13:40", "training with this yeah because I mean", "13:43", "and that's 96 was when Schultz got shot", "13:46", "right and so that's 12 years prior to", "13:49", "you know my Olympic birth and and so", "13:51", "then it's even worse I mean these guys", "13:54", "are literally making nothing and that", "13:55", "all that and then you know then we go", "13:57", "back to the argument of amateurism and", "13:59", "the Olympics is stupid which was", "14:00", "abolished like 92 the dream team was", "14:02", "kind of totally abolished yeah I'm sure", "14:03", "um we have those guys in that era that", "14:06", "84 88 92 90 were making nothing and so", "14:09", "when this guy John du Pont offers them", "14:11", "money and stipends and places to live", "14:13", "they don't really have a better option", "14:15", "and it's freaking sad to be honest about", "14:17", "it and then obviously USA Wrestling", "14:18", "sanctioned him because he gave us a rest", "14:20", "and a lot of money so yeah it was really", "14:22", "bad thing and so we're doing a lot", "14:24", "better in 2018 than we were ten years", "14:26", "ago and way way better than we were", "14:28", "doing 20 years ago", "14:29", "yeah the Olympic thing where they try to", "14:32", "treat the Olympics like it's an amateur", "14:35", "sport event it's a business you make", "14:38", "absolutely ins and billions of dollars", "14:40", "off these athletes who get paid zero is", "14:42", "to me it's disgusting I think it's just", "14:44", "this relic of ancient thinking and these", "14:47", "guys are using it to steal money from", "14:50", "young athletes that's what I think I", "14:52", "think yeah I use more evil the USOC are", "14:56", "the IOC or the NCAA because the NCAA", "14:59", "runs right along the same lines and I", "15:01", "think both are pretty evil and both are", "15:03", "archaic and both need to be changed and", "15:05", "you know if you could abolish the NCAA", "15:08", "and the IOC that'd be fantastic for", "15:10", "athletes worldwide you know well", "15:11", "especially when you look at the football", "15:13", "teams that are getting literally", "15:14", "billions and billions of dollars every", "15:17", "year and these athletes

athletes minds", "24:47", "because you're there's nothing out there", "24:48", "is there a website for this yeah it's", "24:50", "rest of mindset calm no kidding that's", "24:52", "great and they're starting that will", "24:53", "apply to everything well they're", "24:55", "starting to explain expanding a", "24:56", "different disciplines but you're right i", "24:57", "think i think there's these general", "24:59", "principles of sports psych which can", "25:01", "kind of go into any domain right and", "25:04", "you're you're hard percent correct that", "25:05", "every single individual is different", "25:06", "right and one of the like for me i'm i'm", "25:10", "an over-thinker right I'm obsessive I'll", "25:12", "do something over and over and over and", "25:13", "over it again right and so like when I", "25:15", "was 14 I was at this big national", "25:17", "tournament and I was obsessing about who", "25:19", "I had after wrestle and all this stuff", "25:20", "and it wore me out mentally I got my ass", "25:22", "kicked right and my coach said hey I was", "25:25", "that person many many years ago and it", "25:28", "helped me just talk about fishing right", "25:30", "because that may because if I don't", "25:31", "think I don't want to think about what", "25:33", "I'm going to do I'm not one of those", "25:34", "guys because I think about it too much", "25:36", "all obsessed and so ever since age 15", "25:38", "I've always taught myself to train", "25:40", "myself to not think about the", "25:42", "competition within like you know six", "25:45", "hours right so maybe the day before I", "25:47", "can think about a couple days before", "25:48", "gonna think about it but like even when", "25:50", "I'm in MMA locker room I'm not thinking", "25:52", "about my fight yeah my minds off of it", "25:54", "because if I'm not if I don't understand", "25:57", "what my strategy's gonna be by six hours", "25:58", "before and I haven't trained myself by", "26:00", "six hours before I fucked right I'm", "26:02", "already fucked like hours in six hours", "26:08", "you know so like six out you know I I", "26:11", "intentionally fly people to my fights", "26:14", "who are just my friends who have no", "26:16", "intention of telling me what to do MMA", "26:18", "wise and just want to bullshit backstage", "26:20", "right because really smart keeps me", "26:22", "really calm because otherwise I start", "26:24", "obsessing and that's gonna lead to", "26:25", "something really negative so that's like", "26:26", "one thing is we're you know but some", "26:28", "people are the opposite like they f off", "26:30", "too much you kind of got to bring them", "26:31", "back to focus right right you know", "26:33", "another and sports tech concept is is", "26:35", "what they learned you do you want going", "26:36", "to the competition some", "26:37", "got to get him amped up some people most", "26:40", "people you got to call them down quite a", "26:41", "bit like let's relax let's execute", "26:43", "because we need to amped up you know you", "26:44", "execute Brian so I think there's a lot", "26:46", "of these sports psych concepts that can", "26:48", "cross over many different genres but", "26:50", "you're right no one trains you about it", "26:52", "I think it's a huge part of the sport", "26:54", "and it's it's it's overlooked because", "26:56", "the sport is not just and I think this", "26:59", "is true with every sport the sports not", "27:00", "just the movements that you make it's", "27:02", "what's going on inside the Machine the", "27:04", "manager of the body", "27:05", "who's the mind and if the manager is", "27:07", "like poorly formed and structures all", "27:09", "out of whack and you have like whenever", "27:12", "a problem comes up you fall right into a", "27:14", "pit all these things should be addressed", "27:17", "and you should develop this mindset and", "27:20", "develop the ability to manage your", "27:21", "mindset Eddy I think at a young age I", "27:23", "think it's it's really critical yeah no", "27:26", "I totally agree and you know I think I", "27:27", "think one interesting thing which I", "27:29", "don't know if it's gonna happen mmm era", "27:31", "now we'll see right there's very few", "27:34", "people who came from a wrestling", "27:35", "background that are head coaches of MMA", "27:37", "teams right who came from this very very", "27:40", "structured environment upset called", "27:42", "wrestling it's like you go to I want to", "27:44", "I remember my first training camp oh", "27:45", "into American Top Team in Florida and I", "27:47", "show it's 11 o'clock practice show but", "27:49", "11 o'clock no where's where's everyone", "27:52", "at right and then we started 11:45 like", "27:55", "45 minutes late and that's the next day", "27:57", "I'm like well am i swimming in charm at", "27:59", "11:45 or cher show up at 11:00 couldn't", "28:01", "we say at 11:45 I can show up over so I", "28:04", "show up at 11:30 and then they started", "28:05", "11:20 you know like what the hell", "28:07", "whereas in college wrestling if you're a", "28:09", "minute late you're gonna get punished in", "28:12", "college wrestling right it's a very", "28:13", "structured organized system so I'm very", "28:15", "curious to see the day where there is an", "28:18", "MMA team that is very structured like a", "28:21", "college wrestling team would be I think", "28:22", "would be very effective towards", "28:24", "performance for athletes and but then", "28:26", "again you are gonna have is a different", "28:28", "structure because Kyle dressers are poor", "28:29", "right where you're gonna have a bunch of", "28:31", "MMA fighters who get rich and then say", "28:32", "well I don't want to do what you're", "28:33", "saying right now", "28:34", "mm how you gonna make them right they're", "28:36", "the one paying your paycheck so it does", "28:38", "become an interesting circumstance but I", "28:40", "think if there was someone who ran a", "28:42", "highly structured mixed martial arts", "28:44", "team as structured as a college team I", "28:46", "think they would have a gigantic amount", "28:48", "of success I think their guys would get", "28:49", "a lot better a lot faster", "28:51", "and I think you'd see a really", "28:53", "interesting dynamic developed between", "28:55", "the high level athletes and the coaches", "28:56", "well I think they're still trying to", "28:58", "trying to figure out what's the best way", "29:00", "to coach fighters and I think", "29:01", "everybody's got their own way of doing", "29:03", "it you know for us the hobbies way is", "29:04", "different than the way they do it at", "29:06", "American Top Team Matt Hume is doing it", "29:08", "different than the way Duke does it", "29:10", "everybody's got their own way and the", "29:12", "only way you could tell is how well the", "29:14", "athletes compete yeah that's the only", "29:16", "way you really find out who's correct", "29:17", "and who's neat who needs to make", "29:19", "adjustments yeah and it's really hard", "29:20", "infighting because I mean even your", "29:22", "highest level camps how many say", "29:24", "Bellator new you how many high level MMA", "29:27", "fights do they have per year maybe", "29:29", "thirty I mean I think they'd be a lot", "29:31", "for most of these teams right and so you", "29:33", "only get thirty sample sizes right", "29:34", "whereas a college wrestling team you're", "29:37", "gonna have between everybody on the team", "29:39", "the all forty guys you're gonna have at", "29:42", "least a thousand matches every single", "29:43", "year minimum right and then obviously", "29:45", "every event is scored by team every dual", "29:48", "meet is scored by team every NCAA", "29:49", "Championship scored by team so you get a", "29:51", "very good indication of what Coach is", "29:53", "doing right and what

so you have a very good", "30:01", "idea of what's working what is not", "30:03", "working where in MMA I think we struggle", "30:06", "to see it because the sample size isn't", "30:08", "large enough

where they studied a whole", "35:34", "bunch of professional football players", "35:35", "it was like a hundred percent like 99", "35:38", "percent have CT right but then they", "35:40", "studied people who had played football", "35:41", "for any length of time any length of", "35:44", "time and it was like still like 80% of", "35:46", "the people yeah it's like well F I can't", "35:49", "live my life in a bubble like oh how", "35:52", "could eighty percent of people who have", "35:53", "ever played football I mean how many", "35:55", "American males what percentage of", "35:56", "American males walking around at forty", "35:58", "years old today played some level of", "35:59", "football it's like gotta be eighty", "36:00", "percent so you're telling me seventy", "36:02", "percent of America's walking around CTE", "36:04", "yeah are the American males like that's", "36:05", "crazy know that but that's real come on", "36:08", "really is what's happening no I buy you", "36:10", "got you got to think there's got to be", "36:11", "some kind of low threshold because", "36:12", "otherwise forty years down the road if", "36:15", "everybody played football and everyone", "36:17", "who played football has CTE everyone's", "36:19", "gonna be walking a lot of people are", "36:21", "walking around like that come on that's", "36:23", "what's going on or is it it might be the", "36:25", "diet coke I think way more people have", "36:30", "some form of brain damage than real", "36:31", "really yes yeah I do", "36:33", "well I think in the world of martial", "36:35", "arts I know so

"37:10", "plus they have helmets on which allows", "37:12", "them to be more confident clashing into", "37:14", "each other I think a giant percentage of", "37:17", "those guys but you think but so instead", "37:19", "of that one study said it was something", "37:21", "around 80% of anyone who ever played any", "37:23", "level football fever length of time", "37:25", "right only time has CTE that is like I", "37:28", "mean if we take the American population", "37:30", "at least 80% of American men played", "37:33", "football at some point yeah I sell AFC D", "37:35", "so we're talking about like yeah a", "37:37", "gigantic population I think there's", "37:39", "levels of CTE though I mean I think you", "37:40", "know you get to the point where you like", "37:42", "Joe Frazier you

"37:56", "okay and the more studies that I've read", "37:58", "on it the more I've gotten really", "37:59", "disturbed so do you think there's maybe", "38:01", "there's a low threshold for what they", "38:03", "call CTE well there's also genes that", "38:05", "certain people have what was that gene", "38:08", "Rhonda Patrick talked about it I don't", "38:10", "remember what fantastic she's amazing", "38:12", "right yeah and she was talking about", "38:14", "some genes make you more susceptible for", "38:17", "traumatic brain injury than other ones", "38:20", "like if you have it your many times more", "38:23", "likely yeah develop CTE but then also", "38:26", "and then so the other thing that I would", "38:27", "is out of curiosity to me when they did", "38:30", "a CT studies

think", "50:12", "that everybody has this perspective on", "50:16", "who he is that is exaggerated because of", "50:19", "this public persona that he does to be", "50:22", "outrageous so I think that's a", "50:23", "double-edged sword because I think I", "50:25", "think Alex Jones does it as well we're", "50:27", "way crazier than well but okay but same", "50:30", "idea right is like yes part of their", "50:32", "persona is a show is a show it's making", "50:35", "it more extreme yeah because they want", "50:37", "to say that one thing that's totally", "50:39", "effing crazy I'll catch a headline", "50:40", "somewhere right and so they have these", "50:43", "beliefs but then they kind of go beyond", "50:45", "them because it is a show yeah and", "50:47", "because they will make more money if", "50:48", "they get more followers or more people", "50:50", "clicking on the articles or their videos", "50:52", "or whatever right so I think it is but", "50:54", "then you know you go to someone like the", "50:55", "Bret Weinstein guy I think he's", "50:57", "fascinating yeah people calling him a", "50:58", "racist crazy and you know he was strong", "51:01", "liberal", "51:02", "well

"51:12", "yes and but also like he says some", "51:15", "things that are pretty fucked up like", "51:17", "the Sandy Hook stuff you know yeah", "51:18", "saying that Sandy Hook was us he's", "51:20", "looking for conspiracies everywhere", "51:23", "everywhere he finds them someplace so", "51:26", "sometimes he's right exactly sometimes", "51:27", "yeah but the problem with looking for", "51:29", "conspiracies everywhere is you're gonna", "51:31", "you're gonna make people feel terrible", "51:35", "yes I mean if there was a article that I", "51:37", "read about a guy who was a conspiracy", "51:39", "theorist until his son was killed in", "51:42", "Sandy Hook well people were telling him", "51:44", "that his son wasn't killed and that has", "51:47", "some sort of a government actor and this", "51:49", "guy was devastated yeah you know of", "51:51", "course the people that are really the", "51:52", "nutty conspiracy theorist oh he's", "51:54", "fucking undercover still still", "51:56", "undercover there's people out there that", "52:00", "look for conspiracies yeah everything", "52:02", "and it becomes a real problem because it", "52:04", "muddies up the water but I think I think", "52:06", "at the same time you at least for me and", "52:08", "I think we've similar thought processes", "52:11", "you can't just take what mainstream", "52:12", "media tells you and say well I guess", "52:14", "that's how it happened right so Eddie", "52:16", "and in some situations but in Sandy Hook", "52:19", "you have dead kids you have people", "52:21", "grieving your bodies autopsy reports", "52:23", "yeah", "52:24", "it happened at guns you had a mentally", "52:28", "ill person who had access to these dark", "52:30", "then if you take that same thought", "52:32", "process on say Stephen Patek and the Las", "52:33", "Vegas shooting well we still don't know", "52:36", "how that turned out right the Las Vegas", "52:38", "shooting is complicated because we know", "52:40", "one guy did do that", "52:42", "well no new stuff yeah they think", "52:44", "there's other people involved and he", "52:45", "might have gotten help from people yeah", "52:47", "whether it's willingly or unwillingly", "52:49", "but or wittingly or unwittingly but I", "52:52", "don't think there was other people", "52:53", "shooting I think they've said that so I", "52:55", "don't know", "52:56", "right and that's what a lot of these", "52:57", "conspiracies you have to understand that", "52:59", "you're never really gonna know the real", "53:00", "truth right you have to keep an open", "53:01", "mind and you say okay well this person", "53:03", "says this what does this person say what", "53:05", "does this person say do these things", "53:07", "check out with each other and it's like", "53:08", "how many different times does they", "53:10", "change the Las Vegas shootings timeline", "53:11", "right and then it was kind of weird that", "53:13", "it went way out of mainstream me", "53:16", "like I'll sin you heard about for a week", "53:17", "and then you didn't hear about it again", "53:19", "for a sign of the times I think the new", "53:21", "cycle today is about hours yeah but you", "53:24", "would people would want answers I mean", "53:26", "that's the largest mass shooting in", "53:27", "United States history think we'd want", "53:29", "some more clear answers on what really", "53:31", "happened and how it happened and why it", "53:32", "happened and we never really got those", "53:35", "now I know there's been a few new", "53:36", "articles on it recently and so maybe", "53:39", "we're gonna find out more information", "53:40", "but it's an incredibly confusing story", "53:42", "because the guy was clearly a psycho and", "53:45", "clearly fucked up yeah and clearly", "53:47", "planned this out for a long time I mean", "53:49", "he he got hotel rooms overlooking music", "53:53", "festivals in other places yeah and like", "53:55", "was planning out how to do this for a", "53:57", "long time he had a note in his in his", "54:00", "hotel room that had all the ballistics", "54:03", "calculations so he knew like like bullet", "54:05", "dropped from X amount of yards and he", "54:08", "was calculating how to kill all these", "54:09", "people yeah he was on some weird", "54:12", "antidepressants and anti-anxiety", "54:15", "medication which does all kinds of weird", "54:17", "shit to your head there's a guy that was", "54:19", "prone to fits of rage he was a", "54:22", "calculated professional gambler there's", "54:25", "a lot of weird stuff with this guy yeah", "54:27", "the the fact that he accumulated these", "54:29", "weapons over years yeah and maybe did it", "54:33", "knowing that he was going to do this so", "54:35", "you don't there's a whenever there's a", "54:38", "mass shooting or anything that's crazy", "54:40", "you have two things happen one everybody", "54:42", "wants answers and two everybody forgets", "54:44", "about it really quick because some new", "54:46", "shit happens in the news and if it", "54:47", "wasn't your family that got shot it", "54:49", "wasn't someone who you're close to the", "54:50", "gunshot I know people that got shot", "54:51", "there yeah I know people that I met them", "54:54", "I met people in Vegas that got shot", "54:55", "there I talked to them after was over it", "54:58", "was complete and total chaos and when", "55:02", "there's complete and total chaos you get", "55:04", "all sorts of conflicting reports people", "55:06", "were running into other casinos saying", "55:08", "that there's a shooter because they ran", "55:09", "out of that area and so then people were", "55:11", "calling in police reports there's a", "55:12", "shooter Monte Carlo there's a shooter in", "55:14", "this and so those things get reported as", "55:16", "fact when many times it's part of the", "55:19", "confusion of a chaotic mass shooting", "55:21", "like that Vegas event I don't know what", "55:24", "happened other than the fact that this", "55:25", "one guy definitely killed a bunch of", "55:27", "people but whether or not", "55:29", "someone was helping him or whether or", "55:30", "not there was other people involved or I", "55:32", "think they're still investigating as to", "55:33", "yeah and they said but so I guess my", "55:35", "greater point there would be that if", "55:38", "you're an intelligent individual you", "55:39", "can't just take what CBS tells you to be", "55:43", "complete fact right you you go do some", "55:45", "investigation yourself you try to read", "55:47", "from different sources and then hey", "55:49", "sandy hook I think there's like a 99.999", "55:51", "and then I'm percent chance the Sandy", "55:54", "Hook was real right is there some crazy", "55:56", "in the infinitely small chance that", "55:59", "didn't happen sure right but I think I", "56:01", "think there is I think it's very", "56:02", "unlikely and there's a Vegas 0% 0/7 hook", "56:05", "didn't happen okay so I looked into a", "56:07", "pretty but you know it's just sad to me", "56:10", "and you're a dad you know you you know", "56:12", "you the idea of your kid going to school", "56:14", "getting this school getting shot up by", "56:15", "some psychopath yeah imagine if someone", "56:18", "was saying that that was fake yeah after", "56:20", "your kids dead and you'd you'd be", "56:22", "frustrated infuriated you wouldn't even", "56:25", "know where to turn and these that's", "56:27", "actually happening to these people and", "56:29", "they're they're getting labeled as", "56:30", "frauds and people are emailing them and", "56:33", "you know saying how could you do this", "56:34", "you're you're defrauding the American", "56:36", "people you're a part of the Illuminati", "56:37", "or those people who are on right the way", "56:44", "one side of it there's so there's a sofa", "56:46", "if you go a spectrum for me right", "56:47", "there's the American who's drinking diet", "56:49", "coke and eating frozen pizza and", "56:51", "listening to every CBS says right and", "56:53", "then in the total opposite spectrum", "56:55", "there's the group that thinks every", "56:57", "single thing that ever happens in", "56:58", "America is a plain conspiracy by the New", "57:00", "World Order right so those are our two", "57:01", "ends of the spectrum right now we can", "57:03", "fall anywhere in the middle there but I", "57:04", "think it as a telogen individual we look", "57:07", "at situations independently and say well", "57:09", "there's some sketchy things they're not", "57:11", "sketchy things they're that's probably", "57:13", "true right and independently think about", "57:15", "stuff by ourselves and that's yeah", "57:16", "that's how I do it and so you know", "57:18", "that's a wise way to approach it", "57:20", "and I think CBS or NBC or you know any", "57:23", "name your news source they're run by", "57:25", "people and if they weren't there they", "57:27", "only have access to a certain amount of", "57:29", "information and sometimes they get bad", "57:30", "information yeah and sometimes they", "57:32", "don't necessarily know I don't know how", "57:34", "much of it is a part of some grand", "57:35", "conspiracy rather than how much of as a", "57:37", "part of the chaos of these moments the", "57:40", "the lack", "57:42", "of information and people drawing", "57:43", "conclusions and and then also witnesses", "57:46", "on the scene on people on the scene of", "57:48", "something that's crazy they give all", "57:50", "sorts of weird yeah red counts mm-hm and", "57:52", "they're just they're filled with", "57:53", "adrenaline they don't know how to handle", "57:54", "the situation people you know people", "57:57", "don't handle chaotic events very well", "57:59", "yeah but I don't think there is flat", "58:02", "that's fair oh good for you yeah you", "58:06", "what do you possibly believe in that", "58:08", "might be crazy can I take a piss and", "58:10", "I'll no worries man I wonder if there's", "58:15", "something wrong

know that it", "68:26", "was an inside job um not totally I mean", "68:30", "I so I think obviously the planes flew", "68:33", "into the buildings for sure there's no", "68:34", "doubt about that but that may be the", "68:37", "there was Inklings inclinations that had", "68:39", "that was gonna happen and that not", "68:41", "enough was done to stop it I think", "68:44", "this is one this is another thing where", "68:47", "you have a gigantic tragedy and because", "68:49", "of a gigantic tragedy there's a lot of", "68:50", "people that draw these conclusions based", "68:52", "on witness

"these different correlating factors", "69:05", "right you start saying well hey look you", "69:07", "know there was this local tests that", "69:09", "were being done there was they were", "69:11", "looking out for planes that were", "69:13", "potentially gonna fly into building they", "69:15", "they knew this was gonna happen in", "69:16", "advance but if you talk to anybody that", "69:18", "is in intelligence there's they're", "69:21", "dealing with that shit every day", "69:23", "mm-hmm just one day something happens", "69:26", "yeah there's always warnings about", "69:28", "terrorist attacks there's always", "69:30", "warnings about things happen and a lot", "69:31", "of times they these warnings get to", "69:33", "warded like the FBI stopped that last", "69:35", "week there was one there was one in San", "69:37", "Francisco yeah right they had bombs and", "69:39", "they stopped them yeah and this has", "69:42", "happened many times yeah now when when", "69:44", "it doesn't when they don't catch it and", "69:47", "it goes through then people start", "69:48", "thinking oh there was some sort of a", "69:50", "conspiracy they allowed these planes to", "69:52", "fly into buildings the missile hit the", "69:54", "Pentagon and people look there was a", "69:57", "video came out of that last week but I", "69:59", "might have been fake news the Pentagon", "70:00", "thing there was a video of the Pennock", "70:02", "of something hitting the Pentagon which", "70:03", "will take a missile and not an airplane", "70:05", "but I don't believe it was yeah I was", "70:07",

"70:15", "there was one he had a camera thing or a", "70:18", "security camera video that was released", "70:19", "but what they did have is all sorts of", "70:22", "pizza pieces of aircraft all over the", "70:24", "fucking lawn and you know in a blown up", "70:27", "building and a plane that's missing and", "70:29", "all the people dead like I'm gonna guess", "70:31", "it was a plane yeah you know I just I", "70:33", "think people look for conspiracies and", "70:35", "everything because it's exciting well I", "70:37", "mean stimulating about it there is but", "70:40", "then obviously the I I know that you", "70:43", "don't believe that everything we're told", "70:44", "is the truth right away right I mean if", "70:46", "we go to something like Gulf of Tonkin", "70:48", "incident right I mean that's been proven", "70:51", "to be false or the fact like the banana", "70:53", "republics right where Dole asked us to", "70:56", "go take out one of their dictators", "70:57", "because", "70:58", "they were gonna nationalize all the", "70:59", "banana plants in that country yeah I", "71:00", "mean those things have been now proven", "71:02", "to be totally factual that the United", "71:05", "States government went and did that", "71:06", "stuff so the fact that and you know in", "71:08", "1960s or 70s those things were reported", "71:11", "the opposite right so we can't obviously", "71:13", "take everything that we've been reported", "71:15", "as truth well there's definitely been", "71:17", "conspiracies that have been put together", "71:20", "and executed and these conspiracies have", "71:24", "greatly affected the American people the", "71:26", "gulf of tonkin is a perfect example", "71:28", "another one that they were planning on", "71:30", "was Operation Northwoods the operation", "71:33", "Northwoods was one that they were", "71:34", "planning on blowing up a drone jetliner", "71:36", "and blaming it on the Cubans they were", "71:38", "gonna arm Cuban friendlies and have them", "71:40", "attack wanton Omo Bay they're gonna", "71:41", "sacrifice American troops in American", "71:43", "lives and they're gonna do this in order", "71:46", "to get people to be excited about a war", "71:47", "with Cuba yes was this is a real thing", "71:49", "that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of", "71:51", "Staff it was released by the Freedom of", "71:52", "Information Act and it was vetoed by", "71:54", "Kennedy so we know that there were", "71:56", "people at least in 1962 they were", "71:58", "planning on shit like this yeah so", "72:00", "that's a real thing too and the idea", "72:02", "that that just went away and no one does", "72:03", "that anymore it's crazy I don't I don't", "72:06", "believe that I think there's there's", "72:07", "most certainly evil people in all fuckin", "72:11", "sectors of life yes absolutely", "72:13", "yeah so it's good to have an open mind", "72:15", "but there's also a lot of fucking", "72:17", "conspiracy looms and they get consumed", "72:20", "with it that's that's the issues they", "72:21", "get consumed with nothing that I've been", "72:24", "told is true yeah which is obviously I", "72:26", "said the one part of the spectrum and I", "72:27", "anyone who's that end is crazy also yeah", "72:30", "there's people out there that think the", "72:31", "satellites are fake and they think that", "72:33", "the most real and that the earth is flat", "72:36", "is once why I just shake my head like", "72:38", "the moon landing was my favorite really", "72:40", "I got balls deep in that for years I was", "72:42", "completely you think they did not go to", "72:44", "the moon no I don't I don't think that", "72:45", "anymore but you know what I think now I", "72:47", "think I don't know", "72:48", "okay but I do think that it is one of", "72:51", "the more fascinating conspiracies that", "72:53", "between 1969 and 1972 they had seven at", "72:57", "7-7 attempt six of them successful but", "73:01", "they went to the Apollo 13 was the one", "73:02", "that they didn't apparently make it and", "73:04", "they had to come back but that was the", "73:07", "only time in history that a human being", "73:09", "has been more than four", "73:10", "hundred miles above the Earth's surface", "73:11", "all the Space Station missions all the", "73:14", "Space Shuttle missions all that stuff is", "73:16", "is within orbit yeah it's low it's very", "73:20", "low they went 260 thousand miles out and", "73:22", "back in a deep space but they had never", "73:24", "even flown a chicken out there and see", "73:27", "if it live like we really really yeah no", "73:29", "I'm not into this the space Schieffelin", "73:31", "so when they did a couple of flybys look", "73:33", "at went around the moon early before", "73:35", "they landed on them yeah but other than", "73:36", "that I mean without unmanned drones like", "73:39", "what we have on Mars and things like", "73:41", "that we've never really sent a living", "73:42", "thing out through the magnetosphere", "73:44", "through the Van Allen radiation belts", "73:47", "into deep space have it you know I mean", "73:49", "there's all these possibilities of solar", "73:51", "flares and anything that would have", "73:52", "killed them instantly and they just did", "73:54", "that", "73:55", "and then we haven't been able to do that", "73:56", "since 1972 that's the one way I've never", "73:59", "looked into the moon landing I think", "74:00", "it's kind of goofy right well it's it's", "74:02", "weird it's a weird one why have we never", "74:04", "gone back it's been 50 our technology's", "74:07", "far superior to what it was in 1969", "74:09", "right the technology is far superior", "74:11", "except that they're not using that", "74:14", "technology for manned space travel into", "74:17", "you know deep space like that and yeah I", "74:19", "went to the moon so it's like our", "74:21", "technology and all these other areas is", "74:22", "superior but they haven't really worked", "74:24", "towards that because they haven't been", "74:26", "funded so the big issue is in many ways", "74:29", "it's money right it's there's how much", "74:31", "money is there and going to the moon and", "74:33", "it's also very risky to send humans out", "74:36", "there we're talking about manned", "74:38", "missions to Mars now which may or may", "74:40", "not take place by 2030 they're talking", "74:41", "about doing that but it's way cheaper", "74:43", "and safer to send robots out there I", "74:46", "risk human lives throw the moon right", "74:50", "and they put robots on Mars mmhmm yeah", "74:52", "yeah the Rovers the Rovers on Mars our", "74:54", "most that's the most interesting because", "74:57", "they're sending these really", "74:58", "high-resolution photos of the surface of", "75:00", "Mars and they're running tests and", "75:02", "checking for Biological life it's really", "75:04", "really interesting stuff but between 69", "75:07", "and 72 when they did all this stuff I", "75:09", "mean there's the the technology back", "75:11", "then was nothing compared to what they", "75:14", "have now in terms of calculations and", "75:16", "computers and yeah and it's also there", "75:18", "was there's unquestionably some stuff", "75:22", "that whether it was image", "75:24", "or video that was faked and I think", "75:28", "really yeah so I've no idea like I said", "75:29", "never looked into this at all", "75:30", "Gemini 15 is the big one because there's", "75:32", "a photo of Michael Collins it shows him", "75:35", "in deep space and they they use it as a", "75:38", "press really saying that he was on a", "75:40", "spacewalk when it was really an image of", "75:42", "him from a test run where there was all", "75:46", "this stuff in the background and he was", "75:47", "on this harness and they just blacked", "75:49", "out the background and tried to sell it", "75:51", "as him being in space see if you find", "75:53", "that Michael Collins book was looking up", "75:55", "how much it cost to send somebody to", "75:57", "space so it's in the same family not 70", "76:00", "million for a NASA astronaut to fly on a", "76:02", "Russian shuttle private guys trying to", "76:06", "sell tickets to places I mean Bezos is", "76:09", "trying to do it musk obviously but that", "76:11", "space that's just that's just low Earth", "76:13", "orbit that's that's still inside 400", "76:15", "miles", "76:15", "none of them are trying to go anywhere", "76:16", "no well they might in the future at", "76:18", "Branson well I think that's all same", "76:20", "thing it's all throw but but but they", "76:23", "are talking about future visits to the", "76:25", "moon and tomorrow's but a lot of times I", "76:27", "feel like when they say that you know", "76:29", "George Bush Senior said that they were", "76:31", "gonna go to the mute back to the moon", "76:33", "again in like fucking one was that 1990", "76:35", "or whatever the hell that was but people", "76:37", "have always said we're gonna go back to", "76:39", "the moon but we haven't been back since", "76:40", "1972

away", "83:03", "they might have done it they might have", "83:07", "been forced to say some things they", "83:09", "didn't say and that could be part of it", "83:11", "absolutely no they could have done it", "83:13", "but there's a lot of weirdness with the", "83:15", "moon landing it's it's if you wanted to", "83:18", "have like a conspiracy that to wrap your", "83:21", "head around it's

people left and", "83:38", "right back there that's government", "83:39", "though yeah but even more so then", "83:41", "because was unchecked there was no media", "83:43", "yeah there's nothing that would expose", "83:46", "them for this and this stuff in they", "83:49", "would air it on TV once in 1969 you", "83:51", "never see it again unless you watched it", "83:53", "on Phil there's no YouTube we go back", "83:55", "and", "83:56", "watch the astronauts on trampolines", "83:58", "video that's about favorite one you", "84:00", "watch that you'll what in the fuck is", "84:01",

"84:09", "surface of the Moon just like they're", "84:11", "moving in slow motion and then you go to", "84:13", "whatever was like how old 14 or 15 when", "84:16", "they were doing the trampoline thing", "84:17", "they're fucking flying through the air", "84:19", "have you seen that I've not I know I had", "84:22", "never gotten to the moon thing the flag", "84:23", "watch make you watch this and like their", "84:27", "feet are hidden look at this watch these", "84:30", "guys bounce up in the air it's like", "84:31", "they're on some sort of wire like they", "84:32", "could be being yanked up into the air oh", "84:34", "yeah like what the fuck are they doing", "84:37", "and they're playing like falling down", "84:39", "and it's very weird but it could have", "84:42", "been that they were really on the moon", "84:43", "and these guys were fucking cowboys and", "84:45", "Yahoo's and they wanted to bounce around", "84:48", "oh you were Pacey you're posting those", "84:50", "videos yeah I had a debate on Penn", "84:54", "Jillette's radio show with a guy who was", "84:57", "an astronomer and he wasn't willing to", "84:59", "admit a lot of stuff that was a fact", "85:01", "like the fact that Wernher von Braun was", "85:03", "a Nazi and why is the flag looks like", "85:04", "still there", "85:05", "well the flag had a wire first of all on", "85:07", "the top of it that stiffened it up to", "85:09", "make it but there's there's videos of", "85:11", "the flag moving in a non-existent breeze", "85:15", "which is weird too and yes they try to", "85:17", "make some logical explanations for why", "85:20", "the flag could be moving in a vacuum and", "85:22", "some of it makes sense but some of it", "85:24", "doesn't like the the wires one is weird", "85:27", "if you watch them fall down like go to", "85:29", "that one right there Jamie you like if", "85:32", "you watch like sometimes they're falling", "85:35", "down and when they're falling down it", "85:36", "looks like they get yanked back up but I", "85:38", "think it might not have been real", "85:41", "footage what they might have done is use", "85:43", "some test footage like right there Jamie", "85:46", "right there let it go like homeboy falls", "85:48", "down and then it looks like he is yanked", "85:50", "back up look at this oh he did not", "85:52", "standing up yeah what is this that's not", "85:54", "I'm standing up you can't stand up like", "85:56", "that right but you're on the moon 1/6", "85:59", "Earth's gravity but there was no there's", "86:01", "nothing to make him go like this exact", "86:03", "right you can't give up without exact", "86:05", "now we go back to MMA because that's", "86:06", "what these freakin folk style", "86:08", "wrestling's the next generator", "86:10", "mm eh you could turn your bass to get up", "86:12", "you can't look at there's nothing on the", "86:14", "ground how is he gonna get them amazing", "86:16", "yanked up I think he would have super", "86:18", "abs he would have to be like no because", "86:20", "okay maybe a breakdancer maybe a", "86:23", "breakdancer but you can't get up without", "86:25", "putting a bass down right yeah yeah that", "86:28", "was really weird", "86:28", "watch it again watch em get yanked up", "86:31", "he's got no bass yeah that little piece", "86:33", "is played in Reverse yeah it almost does", "86:37", "yeah that he couldn't stand up with but", "86:39", "the thing falls down right afterwards so", "86:41", "it wasn't in Reverse now I think it's", "86:44", "entirely possible that some of the", "86:45", "footage was bullshit but it doesn't mean", "86:48", "that they didn't go to the moon yeah it", "86:49", "means it overzealous people and he only", "86:52", "had one foot on the ground there too", "86:53", "right", "86:54", "yeah that's true look at this watch so", "86:55", "he stood up like you can't do it what", "86:58", "his right foots down his left foots up", "87:00", "but he just goes straight up that's fake", "87:03", "but I've never been in 1/6 Earth's", "87:05", "gravity and neither of you know says we", "87:11", "never went to the moon", "87:12", "I said fake video was real that's from", "87:16", "television ok the video that guy", "87:19", "standing up like that", "87:20", "he got helps on that yeah well can't", "87:22", "stand up like that very well he could", "87:24", "have been on wires it could have been", "87:25", "that they were using that to simulate", "87:27", "what it would be like because they", "87:29", "definitely filmed a lot of simulations", "87:32", "they get a lot of that because they", "87:33", "wanted to prepare the astronauts it's", "87:35", "entirely possible that some of those", "87:37", "simulations gotten passed off as being", "87:39", "an actual video of them on the moon", "87:41", "sure yeah for enough or they faked the", "87:43", "whole fucking thing I wasn't there I", "87:48", "think I think folk style wrestling is", "87:50", "the next that's the next genesis of MMA", "87:52", "right what's next yeah like that guy", "87:55", "standing up people don't realize if you", "87:57", "watch the lemur Rory fight it was", "87:58", "incredibly frustrating to watch for me", "88:01", "because Lima was literally just laying", "88:05", "on his back in guard you know and guard", "88:07", "is almost non-existent effective in MMA", "88:10", "now well unless you're Brian Ortega okay", "88:13", "there's a there's a lot you guys", "88:14", "tiny all right I think those but those", "88:16", "guys are like you like your wrestling is", "88:19", "so highly effective in MMA some people", "88:21", "could say you can't get by just with", "88:22", "wrestling", "88:23", "why I don't wrestle I'm a black belt in", "88:25", "jujitsu all right yeah you use a lot of", "88:28", "rest yeah primarily yeah I mean it's not", "88:31", "that brian ortega can box to we can do a", "88:33", "lot of other things to strike that's", "88:34", "good solid striker but his guard is so", "88:37", "dangerous yeah it's just another level", "88:39", "of dangerous as opposed to most MMA", "88:41", "fighters including Lima yeah and so uh", "88:44", "you know people actually going back to", "88:46", "their base right which has been it's", "88:48", "been a no-no forever and in May you", "88:49", "don't go back to your base because you", "88:50", "expose your back right but then again", "88:53", "you know what percentage of guys who are", "88:54", "sitting in guard actually get", "88:56", "submissions from the guard now the", "88:57", "numbers really small really well so", "89:00", "you're gonna have to find out now okay", "89:02", "like this is so so frustrating so the in", "89:04", "the in the Lima fight", "89:06", "Rory wins the first two rounds it's", "89:08", "competitive but he wins pretty clearly", "89:09", "right but the leg kicks are stick I", "89:11", "never been kicked as hard by anyone as", "89:13", "Dedalus Lima he kicked me one time in", "89:14", "the leg", "89:15", "I'm freaking him walk right for a week", "89:16", "really oh my god he kicked so hard he", "89:18", "kicked so hard so hard and so uh third", "89:22", "round there's this accumulation of leg", "89:24", "kicks and all sudden Rory's leg is", "89:25", "really effed up from getting kicked a", "89:27", "handful of times right he's doing that", "89:28", "low calf game yes well kicking him kinda", "89:30", "all over the ear or Troy starting to do", "89:33", "this one you know checking it", "89:35", "so Lima starts taking control of the", "89:37", "fight the wins the third round in my", "89:39", "opinion fourth round in the beginning he", "89:41", "like kicks him once and Rory falls down", "89:44", "he hops in the mountain starts beating", "89:45", "him up he's like holy crap this fight", "89:47", "might be over and then Sirois recovers", "89:49", "but then in the fifth round Rory goes", "89:51", "out and shoots like a similar like", "89:53", "double leg like immediate we're talking", "89:55", "first ten seconds right and going in a", "89:59", "try anything shit he might get finished", "90:01", "this round I mean he he can barely walk", "90:02", "look at his leg right and so we make us", "90:05", "take him down ten seconds into the round", "90:07", "he literally stayed in guard for four", "90:09", "minutes 50 seconds and you're like at", "90:11", "some point is he gonna try to get up", "90:13", "because he has to get if he gets up any", "90:15", "lands weren't - more kicks are getting", "90:17", "taken down two fights likely over Wow", "90:19", "you know but he refuses to turn to his", "90:21", "base because this is anti jiu-jitsu you", "90:24", "shouldn't turn your base in jiu-jitsu", "90:25", "cleaver getting choked yeah fuck it Joe", "90:28", "at that point you're losing right what", "90:30", "else you gonna do well he never tried to", "90:32", "sweep um you never do you try to submit", "90:34", "him on I tried butterfly sweeping a", "90:35", "couple times", "90:36", "but so at this point I mean even and I", "90:39", "thought it's to two rounds two rounds", "90:40", "right right he was in the fifth round", "90:42", "you know you got try to get up at some", "90:43", "point so that was that did it for Rory", "90:46", "so you want he won 49 46 on to score", "90:50", "cards in 48 47 on one hmm", "90:52", "so why it was 3 2 1 so then even more", "90:54", "right even more reason to get up it", "90:56", "right if you're losing by that much", "90:59", "but yeah leave him I refuse to get up so", "91:01", "at that point I'm thinking oh hey maybe", "91:02", "Lima thinks he won or something I don't", "91:05", "know hmm but yeah so why did you do two", "91:08", "people are struggling with this fact", "91:09", "that in modern day MMA you're going to", "91:12", "have to try to get up because guard is", "91:14", "no longer that effective and you just", "91:16", "get punched in the face over and over", "91:17", "and over again and that's terrible", "91:18", "what are your feelings on going to half", "91:20", "guard and like going for an under try", "91:22", "the same side and yeah try it but it's", "91:24", "not you know again like as me as a as a", "91:26", "top guy I would rather be in half guard", "91:29", "than full guard I'm gonna land a lot of", "91:31", "damage from half guard and then you're", "91:33", "also if you're in half guard you're me", "91:34", "trying to work in yourself tired and", "91:36", "you're very unlikely to sweep me right", "91:37", "so I think half guard is better than", "91:39", "full guard but I think I think", "91:41", "eventually where people are gonna have", "91:43", "to get to is they're gonna have to", "91:44", "actually get up you don't have to get up", "91:45", "and and put your feet on someone's hips", "91:47", "and kicking them is no longer a great", "91:50", "solution it works every once in a while", "91:51", "but it's not like you can do that every", "91:53", "single time it just yeah that's pretty", "91:54", "rare pretty rare so he rarely", "91:56", "everybody's so aware of it yeah so", "91:58", "bottom bottom and top folk style", "91:59", "wrestling I think is the next Genesis in", "92:01", "MMA where people are really gonna have", "92:03", "to have a deep understanding because", "92:05", "once you do get taken down or once you", "92:07", "get a takedown and there's some you know", "92:09", "you'll Romero was the perfect example he", "92:11", "never did folks down wrestling in", "92:12", "America right he's a very very elite", "92:14", "freestyle wrestler but he gets these", "92:16", "takedowns and he can only stay on top", "92:18", "for like 15 seconds right it's like you", "92:20", "did all that work to get the guy on the", "92:21", "ground and now you just let him back up", "92:23", "like what what was the point right what", "92:25", "was the point of it well he smashes some", "92:29", "guys in the ground like Machida when he", "92:30", "got him down on the ground some of them", "92:32", "yeah put him away he's um he's a freak", "92:35", "athlete too it's hard to say hey do what", "92:38", "he

170 or 171 to play on pedal", "96:31", "or non-title and then I would hydrate", "96:34", "back up so now I don't have to do that", "96:35", "that dehydration process I'm literally", "96:37", "the exact same size", "96:38", "I was Prior and you know media", "96:41", "obligations during week are obviously a", "96:43", "lot easier because I'm not worried about", "96:44", "cutting my weight or I'm not feeling", "96:45", "miserable or whatever yeah and it's a", "96:48", "lot safer and then so if someone misses", "96:51", "so misses obviously they're fine the", "96:53", "same as in America if you

it's the same scale used for so", "97:20", "in America at the beginning of the", "97:22", "college wrestling season or high school", "97:23", "you have to do specific gravity test I", "97:25", "believe I might mess up a zero but I", "97:27", "think it's one point zero to five okay", "97:29", "this is specific grade which I know is", "97:31", "the same they used for hydrated not", "97:32",

"97:47", "water you piss it out you're perfectly", "97:48", "hydrated but if you know there have been", "97:51", "a couple times like so in the early days", "97:52", "they did they did tests this is the", "97:54", "first two days were actually just", "97:55", "testing to see where you were at the", "97:57", "third day was the one that counted you", "97:58", "know mm-hmm it's like if you if you ate", "98:00", "a bunch of like meat or something you", "98:02", "might show up as dehydrated even though", "98:03", "that's what you walk around it every", "98:05", "single day so you have to make sure you", "98:07", "drink a lot of water so it's coming out", "98:08", "nice and clear that's an interesting way", "98:10", "of doing it and I think that's a great", "98:11", "idea because I think that is one of the", "98:13", "biggest problems in mmhhh Uriah Hall and", "98:16", "Vitor Belfort got canceled last night", "98:17", "because your Hall was like literally", "98:20", "having seizures on his way to the way", "98:22", "and raizy", "98:22", "right it's good it's fucking insane it", "98:24", "is and I I think it's one of the worst", "98:26", "parts of MMA because I think MMA", "98:28", "shouldn't be about who's slickest in", "98:31", "being able to deceive the wait system I", "98:34", "mean it should be your skill versus your", "98:37", "opponent's kill you both the same size", "98:39", "well the whole point of it is the whole", "98:41", "point of a way is to fight someone our", "98:42", "same size yes that's the whole point of", "98:44", "it yes and so why people would fight", "98:46", "back against the system that one Fc is", "98:48", "using is beyond me because listen the", "98:50", "most miserable part of my weight cut I'm", "98:52", "fine dieting that's all good right but", "98:55", "when you got to cut that last 12 13 14", "98:57", "pounds of water weight out it's", "98:58", "miserable everybody knows is miserable", "99:00", "right and it affects your performance", "99:02", "the next day yeah I mean so my thought", "99:04", "process will it affects that more than", "99:05", "it affects me maybe that's just me being", "99:07", "positive about it all right then why is", "99:09", "that because if you're wrestling better", "99:10", "pussy and I'm not right or maybe it's", "99:14", "just me me psyching myself up so my", "99:17", "thought process on everything is", "99:18", "anything that goes wrong will affect my", "99:20", "opponent more than it'll affect me oh", "99:22", "that's good I am more stable I can deal", "99:24", "with shit that goes wrong most people", "99:26", "affects them and so maybe that's just me", "99:29", "myself that but that makes me feel good", "99:30", "about it well a lot of people feel that", "99:32", "way about weight cutting they like", "99:33", "weight cutting because they think that", "99:34", "the other guy is not gonna be able to", "99:35", "handle it as well you know you can go", "99:37", "through some adversity and then the next", "99:38", "day he's gonna be troubled sure exactly", "99:40", "so but I think if you take that process", "99:42", "away I think it makes media obligations", "99:43", "a lot easier so it makes people a lot", "99:46", "healthier and yeah I mean how many", "99:48", "fights have you just from a business", "99:49", "standpoint how many fights if we had", "99:51", "canceled this year because of the weight", "99:52", "thing I mean it's quite a few did it", "99:55", "change your performance how physically", "99:57", "how'd you feel the next day I think I", "99:59", "felt you know honestly for me I know", "100:00", "they said those studies that you don't", "100:01", "really fully hydrate I believe it was 36", "100:03", "to 48 hours and man I've always felt", "100:06", "fine and so I I so when I graduate", "100:09", "college the weight class in the United", "100:11", "States from for the Olympic stuff was", "100:13", "163 I would weigh roughly 175 on a", "100:16", "day-to-day basis and then water cut down", "100:18", "to 163 and then when I was fighting in", "100:21", "170 I would be say between 183 185 and", "100:24", "water cut down to 170 so my water weight", "100:27", "cut was very very similar every single", "100:30", "time and you know I was discipline in", "100:32", "that manner I want I didn't want to be", "100:33", "fluctuating and so my goal is actually", "100:35", "to get down to my target weight six", "100:38", "weeks prior to competition right so I'm", "100:40", "walking around 183 to 185 six weeks", "100:43", "prior so I'm the same exact person every", "100:45", "single day whereas I think the part that", "100:47", "a lot of these people F up and it's", "100:48", "because they're not disciplined enough", "100:49", "is they try to descend while they're", "100:52", "training right so you know maybe I get", "100:54", "up to 195 which is that's a small bump", "100:56", "some of these guys are really under spin", "100:58", "they get way way way way overweight", "101:00", "right and so during that last six weeks", "101:03", "or even the last couple weeks they're", "101:04", "trying to bring that body weight down", "101:06", "right and so in my mind there's two ways", "101:07", "to lose weight you can diet and lose", "101:09", "body weight right fat mass whatever and", "101:12", "then there's the water weight where", "101:14", "we're sweating and we're taking that out", "101:15", "of us right those are two ways and so I", "101:17", "think a lot of guys and I you know I", "101:19", "don't know if you've ever cut weight", "101:20", "show but I know so I'm for me it was in", "101:22", "college in the summers I get really fat", "101:24", "and then I'd bring my weight down in the", "101:26", "fall and you feel it when you're not", "101:27", "when you're losing more calories and", "101:29", "you're taking in it's like this weird", "101:30", "feeling in your body and you feel like", "101:31", "shit all the time", "101:32", "mm-hmm and so I think a lot of fighters", "101:35", "are doing that really close to win", "101:38", "they're fighting and so now the water", "101:40", "weight cut makes you feel terrible and", "101:42", "now", "101:42", "cutting everything out calorically also", "101:44", "is that's like a double whammy that's", "101:46", "what I think about it there's another", "101:48", "thing that benefits wrestlers and that", "101:50", "wrestlers seem to take pride in being", "101:53", "able to push through discomfort yes and", "101:55", "the more miserable you are the more you", "101:57", "just fucking bite down your mouthpiece", "101:59", "and deal with it because you get used to", "102:02", "doing that all through camps all through", "102:03", "college and high school you're always", "102:06", "dehydrated you're always losing weight", "102:08", "well I mean the college dressing that is", "102:10", "not that the way cutting is not that bad", "102:11", "anymore so they have the system and", "102:12", "people are starting to change 97", "102:16", "I think couple died and so change it but", "102:19", "you know then they Institute the same", "102:20", "thing as one Fc that's sort of a so it's", "102:23", "once you do it in the being a season", "102:24", "find your minimum weight but I think", "102:26", "more than I think what people find it's", "102:27", "it's a one-hour weigh in so you so if", "102:29", "your dual me does that one o'clock", "102:30", "everybody weighs in at noon right so", "102:32", "what people have found out you can't cut", "102:35", "weight you can't go weight you wrestle", "102:36", "like shit so the problem with fighting", "102:38", "doing that though is brain injuries yes", "102:40", "so that's I think we want to see the", "102:41", "best but in college wrestling you talk", "102:43", "about the discomfort thing part of that", "102:45", "is that you know when you go to a", "102:46", "college wrestling program again it's", "102:48", "very structured you can't skip right you", "102:50", "have to be there every single day right", "102:51", "on time and then it's like you have 40", "102:55", "black belt right jiu-jitsu black belts", "102:57", "well and not even just black belts like", "102:59", "world class 19 to 23 in their physical", "103:02", "prime ready to fight each other every", "103:04", "single day and so you get used to this", "103:06", "grind dealing with people battling", "103:08", "people discomfort every single day you", "103:11", "know and a lot of it you also dealing", "103:13", "with injuries like you know and Chael", "103:14", "Sonnen talks about it a lot that hate", "103:16", "and I always talk to Mike as let's", "103:17", "listen the national

"biggest tools that they take into the", "103:44", "Octagon the mental toughness and that", "103:46", "ability to I mean the grind it's again", "103:49", "it's it's a it's a badge of honor in",

about", "109:41", "stipa Miocic that steep a when he went", "109:43", "to Alliance MMA was asking everybody", "109:45", "everything you have to yeah but then", "109:47", "when you go into a competition you can't", "109:49", "have the same mindset thinking I don't", "109:51", "know I need to ask right and so like", "109:54", "kids who kids who have just the", "109:56", "beginner's mind", "109:57", "they'll be they're great in practice but", "109:58", "then they go into a match like coach", "109:59", "which I do here what you do would you", "110:01", "just go wrestle you know but then kids", "110:05", "you come into practice like I know it", "110:06", "all right well that's a very unhealthy", "110:08", "mindset also because you know it's great", "110:10", "when you compete it's great when you", "110:11", "compete so you got you got to balance", "110:13", "both those things right like you can't", "110:15", "have just one because if you're I'd know", "110:16", "it all I'm a badass that's great for", "110:18", "competition but you come into practice", "110:20", "you're gonna stop you're learning right", "110:22", "now when you are coaching kids how much", "110:26", "time if any do you spend on mindset and", "110:29", "so every night on my facebook every", "110:32", "Monday I do this mental Monday and then", "110:33", "I usually repeat repeated or something", "110:35",

moments because that's when", "110:45", "kids care the most right and so like the", "110:47", "kid house timer when he loses and", "110:49", "because he didn't want listen to me yeah", "110:51", "because it will look at look at this", "110:52", "this is a great example you know I said", "110:54", "what I I did this by do private lessons", "110:56", "with this fourth and fifth grader", "110:57", "they're brothers and and like five weeks", "111:00", "in Rome you're doing this wrong you're", "111:01", "doing this wrong you're doing this wrong", "111:03", "you're doing this wrong they don't want", "111:04", "to listen right then they do it they", "111:06", "have a match last week they do it wrong", "111:08", "and it didn't cost him the match but it", "111:09", "almost cost him the match and and now I", "111:12", "can say every single time I see you", "111:13", "doing this wrong I can say remember that", "111:14", "time and that match when you got put in", "111:16", "your back because you did it wrong and", "111:17", "you refuse to listen to me so I think", "111:19", "that matches create great teachable", "111:22", "moments you know like hey you remember", "111:24", "when you wilted under the pressure", "111:25", "because you weren't tough enough well", "111:26", "you need to practice a little harder so", "111:28", "you get used to that pressure remember", "111:30", "when the referee made a bad call and you", "111:33", "flipped out because he made a bad call", "111:34", "and then you didn't think about well I", "111:36", "still have to wrestle dressed as match", "111:37", "right so there could be all these", "111:39", "there's all these teachable moments", "111:40", "within competition where you can say", "111:42", "point to something very clearly and say", "111:44", "well look at this and see how this", "111:46", "affected you and see how you would've", "111:47", "been more successful so I think for a", "111:49", "mental aspect it comes a lot more on one", "111:51", "on one basis and sometimes I'll use it", "111:53", "and for the whole team I don't like like", "111:55", "really picking on people every wants to", "111:58", "know why I will but so I think that I", "112:01", "think this competition provides a lot of", "112:02", "teachable moments for athletes to see", "112:04", "well am i stronger here would only work", "112:07", "on because again we can't you can't say", "112:09", "one mental aspect makes a guy successful", "112:11", "it's this conglomeration of many many", "112:13", "many mental aspects that'll make you", "112:15", "highly successful now when you're", "112:17", "coaching whether it's coaching wrestlers", "112:19", "or MMA final coach MMA fighters anymore", "112:21", "none zero I have okay I helped a couple", "112:23", "buddies but I don't you don't consider", "112:25", "it and really just helps you when you", "112:27", "could let's say just say when you're", "112:28", "coaching wrestling yeah do you do you", "112:30", "concentrate at all on strength and", "112:32", "conditioning or is it from the wrestling", "112:35", "yeah that you get most strength", "112:36", "conditioning so we only got them you", "112:39", "know an hour and a half three or four", "112:40", "times a week and so we don't do a lot of", "112:43", "strain conditioning I know I respect the", "112:44", "older guys I recommend they do some on", "112:46", "their own you know for a college program", "112:48", "for a high school program where we're", "112:50", "getting", "112:50", "Monday through Saturday maybe twice a", "112:53", "day possibly obviously we're gonna do", "112:54", "that but you know we're an academy you", "112:57", "know we're kind of on our own we get", "112:58", "them three or four times a week so it", "113:00", "just doesn't Trump what we need to do in", "113:02", "that short time window but how do you", "113:04", "balance it out though like how do you", "113:06", "know how much strength the conditioning", "113:07", "to do versus how much technique and", "113:09", "scale work I mean at the college level", "113:11", "are we talking about or because we do", "113:12", "not we do no strength conditioning and I", "113:14", "recommend kids you're in their own you", "113:15", "know and if I had 12 hours a week with", "113:18", "them I would do that but we you know we", "113:20", "don't we don't have that ability to I", "113:22", "think I think it's important I think", "113:24", "it's really important I don't think it", "113:26", "choice I don't think it Trump's", "113:27", "especially knowledge and then if kids", "113:29", "wrestle really hard against each other I", "113:31", "think Kael had that one saying like", "113:32", "wrestling's the best training initially", "113:34", "I came over he said something if you", "113:36", "wrestle really hard against each other", "113:37", "you're gonna develop those things it's", "113:39", "like I think like people when when I", "113:41", "grab people or squeeze people they're", "113:42", "like oh my god I've never felt anything", "113:44", "like it and I think that comes from that", "113:46", "doesn't come if you put me in a weight", "113:47", "room I can do nothing abnormal I am not", "113:49", "abnormally strong in any exercise I'm", "113:51", "actually like on a college Division one", "113:53", "college team I'm significantly less", "113:54", "strong than most people right but then", "113:56", "when they wrestle me they're like holy", "113:58", "shit I've never felt anything like that", "113:59", "and I think it's because a lot of those", "114:02", "things that I do are very very very", "114:04", "wrestling specific and I developed that", "114:06", "strength because when I grab some perks", "114:08", "like freakin grab as hard as I can when", "114:09", "I squeeze them I squeeze them as hard as", "114:11", "I can and so now from doing that", "114:13", "thousands of times I've developed that", "114:14", "squeeze or that strength and so I think", "114:17", "strength addition is important but I", "114:19", "don't think it Trump's doing other stuff", "114:20", "and if I had all the time in the world", "114:22", "and these kids didn't have to go to high", "114:23", "school or middle school I'd put them", "114:25", "through some but you know we don't have", "114:26", "that luxury what did you do when you", "114:28", "were finding an MMA how much did you", "114:30", "devote to strengthen twice a week Kish", "114:32", "maybe three sometimes what kind of stuff", "114:35", "um so I had a personal trainer since I", "114:37", "moved to Milwaukee I actually and then I", "114:38", "actually helped him open up a CrossFit", "114:40", "gym and it wouldn't be that specifically", "114:45", "CrossFit workouts but kind of that type", "114:47", "of work nothing slow when I'm doing", "114:49", "three sets of ten then two sets eight", "114:51", "you know nothing slow like that", "114:53", "potentially you know one one or two days", "114:55", "we might do like a slower start and then", "114:57", "but you know I think fighting you need", "115:00", "to be very highly active you know you", "115:01", "need to be in really good shape and evil", "115:03", "move", "115:03", "things really fast so kind of cross it", "115:05", "type stuff I think is probably the right", "115:07", "direction to go and now when I go back", "115:09", "to college programs besides like the", "115:11", "heavy weights the in-season stuff for", "115:13", "college programs is mostly higher paced", "115:15", "stuff which i think is you know very", "115:18", "relevant to both wrestling and fighting", "115:20", "so did you do when you were saying like", "115:23", "you're doing like CrossFit style", "115:24", "workouts so were you doing like", "115:26", "kettlebells box jumps yeah everything", "115:28", "just so when I said that I just meant", "115:30", "that you know we were moving at a high", "115:32", "pace through a lot of stuff you know and", "115:34", "it would be like he would tell me hey do", "115:36", "go do some no do slip OSHA's do this do", "115:38", "that right now what about like your diet", "115:40", "and nutrition and supplements I think I", "115:43", "have never been that much into nutrition", "115:47", "I I so listen I don't okay I was fat", "115:50", "when I was a little kid right clay too", "115:52", "much at age 11 I said I don't be fat", "115:54", "anymore so I went from a hundred thirty", "115:55", "pounds 100 pounds in damn you lost 30", "115:58", "pounds yeah eleven six fifth grade

"116:08", "you were wrestling then too yeah you", "116:10", "know I was I was having some success", "116:12", "because when you're fatter there's not", "116:13", "many people to compete against

at eleven", "116:24", "yeah I know and that's that's so now", "116:25", "when I look at kids I think I think the", "116:27", "mental maturity is huge in long-term", "116:29", "success being able to make like see see", "116:31", "the future and make decisions on what", "116:33", "you want to do at that young age so lost", "116:35", "thirty pounds and so now I've slowly", "116:37", "started like

"at home a lot we make really healthy", "116:55", "food and so but I don't take any", "116:58", "supplements zero no multivitamins", "117:01", "nothing nothing so you get all your", "117:03", "nutrients from your food yeah and I just", "117:05", "figured like I saw a couple I tried a", "117:08", "couple supplements in college I never I", "117:09", "never felt anything from them like I", "117:11", "didn't feel any different you know and", "117:13", "so I'm like I didn't feel anything why", "117:15", "me why am I gonna take", "117:17", "we need to take it and then so then", "117:19", "obviously I became like this anti PE D", "117:22", "Crusader it you know by chance and so", "117:25", "then it's like well now I really can't", "117:27", "take anything because if I go take", "117:28", "something and I pop hot because these", "117:29", "idiots are putting something in the", "117:31", "supplement should be there I'm gonna", "117:32", "look like a total asshole right so I", "117:34", "literally I don't I didn't even take", "117:36", "protein I may have took nothing Wow yeah", "117:38", "that's crazy so did you make sure that", "117:41", "you ate the proper amount of vegetables", "117:42", "green leafy vegetables and Foodland", "117:45", "script you know like it's like healthy", "117:49", "food like we're eating salads in right", "117:51", "you know I'm not eating

grams of that or so I", "118:02", "really think what am i and I this has", "118:04", "been proven by science that you only", "118:06", "have a certain amount of time every", "118:08", "single day to have a high amount of", "118:10", "mental focus on stuff and so I think", "118:12", "like my training is more important than", "118:13", "focusing on nutrition and stuff and so I", "118:15", "want to really like really Zone in", "118:18", "really high-level focus when I'm", "118:20", "training and stuff and so I think if I", "118:22", "worry about also stuff they'll take my", "118:24", "focus away from that right right or", "118:26", "wrong that's kind of how I thought about", "118:27", "it that's a smart way to approach that", "118:29", "and it never really affected me I mean", "118:31", "like I said that you know even when I", "118:32", "took the supplements in college I never", "118:34", "really felt them at all so right well if", "118:37", "I don't feel it why would I do it you", "118:38", "know it's kind of ironic though that you", "118:40", "were an anti-drug Crusader and you went", "118:42", "to the one place it doesn't drug test I", "118:43", "know right it really hurt it hurt me but", "118:47", "there's you know and it is if you look", "118:49", "at so we talked about like Singapore", "118:50", "being so fantastic and having a really", "118:52", "high GDP a lot of the countries over", "118:54", "there", "118:55", "Indonesia Manila you know they'd Manila", "118:59", "Philippines they don't have huge high", "119:01", "GDP s right I mean they're not super", "119:04", "wealthy countries and so when we think", "119:06", "about you know how much it costs to buy", "119:09", "a lot of the steroids that are readily", "119:11", "available in America they're just not as", "119:13", "available and so I think they do have a", "119:15", "point and if you look at the athletes", "119:18", "there's not a lot of athletes that look", "119:19", "like yo Romero now you all right", "119:21", "probably not using like I pointed out", "119:22", "earlier", "119:23", "well he's tested clean except once", "119:24", "except once painted supplement but they", "119:27", "have moved it was a", "119:28", "supplement so when you look at their", "119:29", "athletes maybe accept a few of the", "119:31", "Russian ones they look pretty normal", "119:34", "like it's probably unlikely that they're", "119:36", "using from my for a few Russian ones", "119:38", "that's it for Russia they can't help it", "119:40", "it's like part of the culture yeah that", "119:45", "one Russian the one Russian guy that I", "119:46", "fought in April of 16 he was freaking", "119:50", "enormous and you know the other thing", "119:52", "that I think a lot of MMA people are", "119:53", "using some type of oh my gosh I'm", "119:58", "playing what gives you endurance BPO BPO", "120:00", "that type of stuff because if you watch", "120:02", "a college dress that's how tired people",

definitely", "120:10", "tested hot for that in the UFC who's the", "120:13", "guy that fought Mighty Mouse yeah there", "120:15", "is no rush yeah yeah crazy yeah so but I", "120:18", "think more people are using that and I", "120:19", "think if you you know you don't have any", "120:22", "conclusive evidence but if you look at", "120:23", "when you sort of started and then how", "120:25", "some of these people fell down uh", "120:27", "straight down", "120:28", "their bodies look different they look", "120:30", "different their company I mean yeah you", "120:31", "know Johnny Hendrix would be one that", "120:32", "comes to mind I mean what's his freakin", "120:34", "record since you saw it it ain't very", "120:35", "good I'll tell you that much and Austin", "120:37", "he can't make weight and you know if you", "120:39", "remember is and I'm so obviously I watch", "120:40", "Johnny because he was I couldn't stand", "120:42", "Johnny he beat me when we were 17 and", "120:45", "then I tried to wrestle my senior so we", "120:48", "were different he was 165 I was 174 and", "120:50", "I wanted wrestling for the all-star", "120:51", "classic and I called the people who put", "120:53", "it on I said I wanna wrestle him and", "120:55", "they turned the match down so that's", "120:57", "I've kind of like I want to get that one", "120:58", "back but I never got to get it back from", "121:00", "when I was 17 so I've been following", "121:02", "Johnny pretty closely if you watch", "121:04", "Johnny like a Content fight prior to", "121:07", "that he gets so tired in like two rounds", "121:10", "right and we just fight exhausted", "121:12", "exhausted and then all Sonny's going", "121:14", "these five round fights and you're like", "121:15", "whoa how are you gonna get tired and", "121:18", "that exhausted two rounds and now you", "121:20", "can fight for five rounds Johnny like", "121:21", "well not here I mean in his defense I", "121:24", "don't got any proof team takedown they", "121:26", "implemented a pretty fantastic program", "121:29", "over there I mean they spent a lot of", "121:30", "money on it that was the whole thing", "121:32", "where they were they were paying him", "121:34", "yeah then they wanted 50% of his I got", "121:36", "the same offer right at a college did", "121:37", "you yeah we were both graduate", "121:39", "I felt like he was betting as myself", "121:41", "yeah thank you $100,000 a year for seven", "121:44", "years", "121:44", "they got 50% of your career earnings and", "121:46", "I said my thought was well if I ever", "121:49", "make it really big I'm gonna make a", "121:51", "million dollars a fight and I'm gonna", "121:52", "pay him back in one fight you know like", "121:54", "it would be like hedging your bet", "121:56", "against yourself and I don't ever bet", "121:58", "against myself yeah but for them I get", "122:01", "it too it's like they have to have some", "122:03", "sort of a reason to put out that it's a", "122:05", "big bet whether or not you're gonna be", "122:07", "able to be us absolutely so if you think", "122:09", "you suck it's good to take that bet make", "122:12", "it dawg", "122:13", "I'm okay with making a little bit of", "122:15", "money yeah then it's a good bet it", "122:16", "doesn't seem like the best strategy it", "122:19", "doesn't say I mean it's interesting and", "122:21", "I think I think there's probably", "122:22", "somewhere in there with you know I know", "122:24", "if you manage this where you go pick out", "122:26", "it's pretty proven that alcohol justhe's", "122:28", "are gonna make really damn good fighters", "122:30", "that that's pretty proven so yeah going", "122:31", "to try to find a couple every year", "122:33", "spending some money on them and then", "122:35", "getting a percentage of their earning", "122:36", "that's probably a pretty I don't want", "122:38", "say a safe bet for the people putting", "122:41", "out the money but it's you know takedown", "122:43", "team takedown had Jake Rosholt who was", "122:44", "an amazing wrestler and for whatever", "122:46", "reason he just didn't transition great", "122:48", "to fighting right it he was good but he", "122:50", "wasn't great and it was like for as good", "122:52", "of a wrestler as it was probably always", "122:54", "gonna be a little better yeah what do", "122:55", "you think is the factor look if you had", "122:57", "to look at him wrestler because there's", "123:00", "not a lot of outliers like that yeah", "123:02", "like where you don't like Jin so when we", "123:04", "talk about how good Jake right he still", "123:05", "made the UFC he still won some fights", "123:07", "okay he wasn't a bad fighter but he was", "123:10", "a three-time NCAA champ so you expect", "123:12", "him hey he'll probably go challenge for", "123:14", "a UFC title so I you know in his case I", "123:16", "I don't know what the factor was but", "123:20", "there's not a lot of outliers like that", "123:22", "where they're a really high level", "123:23", "wrestler and then they don't have any", "123:24", "success MMA that's really unique you", "123:27", "don't see it a lot yeah it's it's", "123:29", "interesting like I've looked at it from", "123:31", "striking from if you see like really", "123:34", "high level kick boxers some have a style", "123:37", "that would readily translate to MMA and", "123:39", "some are fantastic kick boxers like", "123:41", "maybe Peter Aerts is a good example or a", "123:43", "nesto who swear I wouldn't really think", "123:45", "they would translate that well today", "123:47", "whereas Mirko Cro Cop who might have", "123:49", "been like a slight notch below them in", "123:51", "terms of kickboxing", "123:52", "translates perfectly to MMA cuz", "123:54", "so explosive and quit and I would want a", "123:57", "decent takedown defense - he's infected", "124:00", "for a while developed it but the thing", "124:01", "about Mirko was unbelievable power and", "124:05", "speed and he could just close the", "124:07", "distance quickly in black yeah and I", "124:09", "think that is a difference between that", "124:11", "and the guy who's like a methodical set", "124:13", "things yeah those guys didn't do as well", "124:16", "they did translates well they get took", "124:17", "and taken down to me what what would you", "124:21", "think would be like the stepmom it's", "124:23", "it's very different", "124:25", "you don't want the other things I think", "124:26", "benefits us wrestlers is the fact that", "124:28", "people are stuck on doing jiu-jitsu the", "124:30", "jutsu way right and strikers are stuck", "124:32", "on striking when we come into MMA we", "124:35", "know we can't win a match just by", "124:36", "wrestling right so we know we know I got", "124:40", "to add striking I gotta add jiu-jitsu", "124:42", "and I'm open to that idea right I'm open", "124:44", "to those ideas that I have to add those", "124:46", "things into my arsenal where'd some", "124:47", "jiu-jitsu guys are like well I'm just", "124:49", "gonna submit them yeah and they don't", "124:50", "they don't develop there I mean there's", "124:52", "there you can literally not name me Joe", "124:56", "jiu-jitsu guy or striking guy well maybe", "125:00", "Jose Aldo who has developed high-level", "125:02", "wrestling but you can name a lot of", "125:04", "wrestlers who have developed high-level", "125:06", "something else hmm", "125:08", "right I mean when you see the crossover", "125:09", "like John Jones was a wrestler right he", "125:13", "can strike with pretty much anyone on", "125:14", "the planet right I mean stipa Miocic was", "125:17", "a wrestler he can pretty much strike", "125:18", "when they know on the planet I mean so", "125:19", "you had these wrestlers who are becoming", "125:21", "high-level at these other skills but you", "125:23", "don't have a lot of other skills", "125:25", "becoming high-level at wrestling and I", "125:27", "and I'm for me I think it's the", "125:28", "stubbornness of people who come from", "125:30", "those other backgrounds are too stubborn", "125:31", "to wanna work a lot on wrestling where", "125:34", "it's Russell's are like okay teach power", "125:35", "strike", "125:36", "yeah I think it's a it's a recognition", "125:38", "of what's important like George st.", "125:39", "Pierre is a perfect example of a guy who", "125:41", "started off at a keel Christian", "125:42", "background didn't wrestle in college or", "125:44", "high school became a fantastic rest yeah", "125:46", "he's good yeah and just figured it out", "125:48", "and realized realize what a critical", "125:49", "skill it is - yeah absolutely", "125:51", "so there's a handful of very small", "125:53", "handful Jose Aldo would be like he", "125:55", "wasn't an offensive wrestler but he", "125:57", "would be like he was so ridiculously", "125:59", "hard to take down I mean fantastic", "126:01", "takedown defenses so there's a handful", "126:02", "um but there's not a lot and then but", "126:04", "then if you go to wrestlers going to", "126:05", "opposite direction into jiu-jitsu or", "126:08", "striking you know you can name quite a", "126:10", "few that were able to do those things", "126:11", "really well you know it's interesting", "126:13", "when you see a guy like khabib", "126:15", "nurmagomedov and you see fantastic fuck", "126:18", "yeah", "126:18", "and his his mauling aggressive wrestling", "126:22", "I mean you see what a massive factor it", "126:25", "is he fights like the Edson Barboza", "126:27", "fight yeah like that to me is one of the", "126:30", "perfect examples when I say look the", "126:32", "ability to take guy down and control him", "126:34", "on the ground is the the of it's the", "126:36", "bottom of the pyramid it's the most", "126:38", "important foundation yes because he", "126:40", "dictates where the fight takes place", "126:41", "yeah you might catch him when he's", "126:43", "coming in trying to get you you might", "126:44", "but if he gets you he was like a frickin", "126:46", "Terminator though he was just saying I'm", "126:48", "just going to come get you", "126:49", "yeah he just eight kicks no hope just a", "126:53", "constant chasing him around chasing him", "126:55", "right it was it was insane yeah no he's", "126:58", "fantastic yeah but no I would totally", "126:59", "agree that at the bottom of the pyramid", "127:01", "it's like it's the trump card if like if", "127:04", "you fighting a wrestling you can't stop", "127:05", "a takedown you're gonna lose 90% of time", "127:07", "yeah you know and if if you're the", "127:10", "wrestler and you can go get a takedown", "127:11", "really easily", "127:12", "you're gonna win 90% of time the only", "127:14", "wild card in that equation is a guy like", "127:16", "Brian Ortega fights so well off his back", "127:19", "but how many people get submissions from", "127:20", "guard how many of those yeah me even", "127:22", "like in having Anthony Pettis who got a", "127:24", "lot of submissions guard mmm-hmm", "127:25", "a lot of that was transitions off of my", "127:28", "body kicked Benson Harrison I bought a", "127:29", "kick Benson Benson Harrison he's getting", "127:31", "body kicked so he dives in for a", "127:32", "takedown his arm bar right or Gill", "127:34", "Melendez gets creatine choke because he", "127:36", "got jacked a few times right so there", "127:38", "are there's a handful of those but just", "127:40", "strictly like I take you down you're in", "127:41", "guard then I submit you right maybe for", "127:44", "three silver do him every once in a", "127:45", "while", "127:46", "yeah maybe Brian Ortega but the numbers", "127:48", "pretty damn small it is very small yeah", "127:50", "it's smaller now that I think ever", "127:51", "before because people understand the", "127:53", "takedown", "127:53", "the guard defense even like this guy", "127:56", "that I so one of the things that", "127:58", "frustrates me the most more than", "127:59", "anything else that made his bad strategy", "128:00", "she was like drives me up the wall like", "128:02", "the lima thing but this frickin", "128:04", "knucklehead that fought Michael Chandler", "128:05", "on on Saturday I didn't see it his", "128:09", "name's Boyd II go to Yemen I don't know", "128:11", "his damn name is", "128:12", "so the first round he pulls guard like", "128:15", "fast", "128:16", "gets freakin hammered on for like four", "128:19", "minutes and then he ends up my bottom in", "128:21", "the second round", "128:22", "third round he gets taken down in I", "128:25", "don't know 15 seconds did he try to get", "128:27", "up one time", "128:28", "no he just laid there guys I asked for", "128:30", "performance in 45 seconds", "128:31", "like every once while try a comer", "128:33", "everyone so I'll try a triangle but it's", "128:35", "like dude you're getting your ass", "128:37", "whipped you're down two rounds of", "128:38", "nothing try to get up try to do", "128:40", "something change your strategy if your", "128:42", "strategy is not working you can't just", "128:43", "stick with the same bullshit get your", "128:45", "asshole for another four minutes and 45", "128:46", "seconds I give me a break what do you", "128:48", "think is gonna happen down there well I", "128:49", "think some guys get locked into a", "128:50", "defensive position like they realize", "128:52", "they're getting overwhelmed and so they", "128:54", "just try to survive you think so yeah", "128:56", "really yeah hmm you don't think that way", "128:58", "because you're a champ and champions", "129:00", "don't think that way but I realize some", "129:02", "people there's a there's a acceptance of", "129:05", "their their fate ass-whooping this this", "129:07", "is just they're getting their ass", "129:09", "whooped and so they just try to stay", "129:10", "conscious they try to just protect", "129:12", "themselves as much as they can kind of", "129:14", "like Edson Barboza but then you know", "129:16", "interesting Barbosa you saw once he", "129:20", "realized he was gonna survive like when", "129:21", "it was like two minutes left on third", "129:23", "round maybe ish mmm-hmm it's like the", "129:25", "first round he's like I'm just gonna I'm", "129:27", "just gonna survive right but then when", "129:29", "there was cut misses he's like man he", "129:30", "was like okay I'm gonna fight again I", "129:32", "want to make it through this shit I", "129:33", "might as well if I want to make it", "129:34", "through this I might as well just fight", "129:36", "back yeah right so he start fighting", "129:37", "back really hard like the last two", "129:39", "minutes F he tried he certainly tried", "129:40", "but there was a period in the middle", "129:42", "where he like had resigned to just take", "129:43", "it an asshole but well I think he was", "129:45", "just body was just not responding he was", "129:47", "getting so fucked up and you could see", "129:49", "the pace that Habib put on um harden a", "129:51", "first round like halfway into the round", "129:54", "Barboza's like Jesus Christ you see look", "129:57", "in his eyes get that thousand-yard stare", "129:58", "is like whoa when I sign up for yeah", "130:01", "this guy's on another level I mean he", "130:04", "really is on another level I'm", "130:05", "fascinated by him fighting Tony Ferguson", "130:08", "and apparently they're gonna do that now", "130:10", "it's didn't happen April yeah they don't", "130:12", "know if it's gonna be for the interim", "130:13", "title or the actual title whether", "130:15", "they're gonna strip Connor", "130:16", "they're in a weird position I think he", "130:18", "beats up Tony that's just my and I've", "130:20", "underestimated Tony before so I could be", "130:22", "wrong again I just think I think it's a", "130:24", "again trump card I think Tony's kind of", "130:27", "well those guys where he's pretty good", "130:28", "everywhere he's pretty damn solid", "130:29", "wrestling high-level jujitsu but I see", "130:33", "Kabir's wrestling even better than", "130:35", "Tony's wrestling", "130:36", "it's gonna end up on the ground and I", "130:38", "think Tony's gonna think he can submit", "130:40", "him because it's GG to his very high", "130:42", "level but I think everyone who sings", "130:44", "work Bebe's just good enough not to get", "130:46", "submitted and then he's gonna land", "130:47", "damage and land damage and land damage", "130:49", "inland damage and Tony's gonna get close", "130:51", "to a submission and close to a", "130:52", "submission close to a submission but not", "130:54", "quite get it and then all this damage is", "130:57", "gonna just accumulate and accumulate and", "130:59", "accumulate that's kind of how I see it", "131:00", "going it's fascinating and I also think", "131:02", "it's fascinating now that Abebe has", "131:04", "changed his training and has a real", "131:06", "nutritionist and no problem making", "131:07", "weight yeah all the factors that played", "131:10", "into him getting removed from the last", "131:13", "time they were supposed to fight pulled", "131:14", "out the card I thought that was kind of", "131:16", "overblown he'll he missed weight one", "131:17", "time he only missed one is weight one", "131:21", "time but his body shut down when he's", "131:23", "making way for the michael johnson fight", "131:24", "in a similar way but he still did the", "131:26", "michael johnson fight yeah but it was", "131:27", "the same thing happened during the", "131:28", "weigh-in it was a rough way in but", "131:30", "there's been other guys who miss wait", "131:31", "many times I mean if we go to Johny", "131:34", "Hendricks Johny Hendricks Melvin", "131:36", "Guillard", "131:36", "no Kelvin Gastelum and they miss him I", "131:38", "along with silk yeah I thought the key", "131:40", "thing kind of got overplayed penis", "131:42", "weight one time he had some injury that", "131:43", "sucked for him but it was that what was", "131:45", "happening for a world title fight you", "131:47", "know yeah fighting for the interim time", "131:49", "he misses wait yeah I mean and so as one", "131:52", "of those where he probably just like it", "131:53", "was like okay for him to make it but be", "131:55", "difficult and he just got just a little", "131:56", "bit too big actually was it for a world", "131:59", "interim title when he was supposed to", "132:00", "think it was was Kevin Lee right that", "132:04", "was for the world yeah yeah or interim I", "132:06", "enjoy that yeah the whole division is", "132:08", "kind of fucked up with Connor not even", "132:10", "knowing whether or not he's fighting it", "132:11", "they're gonna strip him right yeah", "132:12", "mostly I think so", "132:14", "oh what a matter unless Connor says fuck", "132:15", "it I'm in I think I'll be the best back", "132:17", "fuck it", "132:18", "Oh get forked I want to keep me about I", "132:22", "know the best course action strip Connor", "132:24", "let let could be even Tony fight it out", "132:26", "and then if Connor wants to come back", "132:27", "give him a title shot that's gonna", "132:28", "happen whatever well I think the the", "132:30", "what would be the the most lucrative", "132:32", "thing as Connor versus Jesus no I was", "132:35", "shut up Joe ought to fight GSP oh you do", "132:37", "the one day yes I want to be number one", "132:38", "I don't want to fight tiring because", "132:40", "we've been your friends for 20 years I", "132:43", "want to fight GSP that's what one fight", "132:45", "you think that they would set that up", "132:46", "they would have no try to set up GSP", "132:48", "versus tire", "132:48", "right that would be the big super GSP", "132:51", "doesn't want to fight anyone who can hit", "132:52", "hard because he's worried about the", "132:53", "brain damage so yeah I don't hit hard", "132:55", "right interesting we're looking at yeah", "133:00", "train with GSP I've never changed so", "133:01", "I've trained with almost every top", "133:03", "welterweight of this era except yes P", "133:06", "really yeah well just being worried but", "133:10", "shields Fitch Diaz a couple times tire", "133:13", "and obviously you don't go down the line", "133:16", "I've trained with pretty much everyone", "133:17", "in this era what do you feel like if you", "133:20", "do wind up retiring mmm what do you feel", "133:22", "like you'll you'll wind up doing just", "133:23", "coaching wrestling yes I love doing it", "133:25", "really enjoy it a lot", "133:27", "so I could I say I don't think I'd go", "133:30", "back to the collegiate level that's", "133:31", "obviously always an option I went out", "133:34", "for the four years that coach called", "133:35", "Russ and I loved it", "133:36", "you know and then it was like hey I won", "133:38", "the belt or
