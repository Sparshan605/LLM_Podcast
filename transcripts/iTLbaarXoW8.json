only daggers", "09:12", "they're definitely brought up", "09:13", "differently but like any wrestlers just", "09:15", "brought up different toughness different", "09:17", "level of toughness a different level", "09:19", "level of competitiveness so like when", "09:21", "you go to jiu-jitsu school the first", "09:23", "thing you learn how to do is bow to mat", "09:24", "and kiss the instructors ass that's it", "09:27", "you know you bow to mat and you're", "09:28", "learning self-defense you learn that", "09:29", "respect and wrestling it's not about", "09:31", "that right it's about dominating it's", "09:33", "about winning and dominating so they're", "09:36", "they have years of experience of doing", "09:38", "that like just that mindset it's also", "09:40", "about being uncomfortable all the time", "09:41", "yeah yeah and it's like Gator just the", "09:43", "room is always rough it's always tough", "09:45", "like you go towards you Jitsu school", "09:47", "it's a bunch of dudes smoking pot lamb", "09:49", "back they roll five minutes to sit back", "09:52", "smoke 4:30 roll another five minutes and", "09:55", "you go to a wrestling room it's hot", "09:56",

"10:14", "learned a lot of that early so I feel", "10:16", "like that's kind of the difference", "10:19", "they're just brought up different yeah I", "10:21", "definitely think there's something to", "10:22", "that and then also being able to cut", "10:24", "weight and still compete yeah I mean so", "10:26", "I'm always telling my fighters now like", "10:28", "when you have that wrestling aspera",

well", "10:57", "they're always at a disadvantage against", "10:59", "somebody who wrestled right because the", "11:01", "experiencing competition yeah yeah that", "11:03", "makes sense", "11:04", "the only thing about some rest", "11:06", "because of the like there's like a", "11:08", "tightness to wrestling and some", "11:11", "wrestlers just never learn how to be", "11:13", "loose yeah yeah yeah and some some pick", "11:15", "it up quick it's weird well that's the", "11:17", "difference and that's what makes some of", "11:18", "them better than the other ones yeah", "11:20", "when I look

"29:47", "to like go soul searching for because he", "29:49", "might not have it hmm you know so if you", "29:52", "don't have it said oh you just started", "29:53", "going you know what I need to get faced", "29:55", "just make a bunch of money do you think", "29:56", "maybe it's where he trains do you think", "29:59", "maybe it's he you know he's training", "30:01", "overseas with you know he trains with a", "30:04", "Lear the TV who's really good yeah I", "30:05", "mean does he have world-class coaching", "30:08", "over there I mean does he does he have", "30:10", "world-class sparring partners people", "30:12", "that recognize yeah so that's that's", "30:14", "what I think - is it in Europe and some", "30:17", "I mentioned is to me a couple couple", "30:18", "months ago is it and you're up the", "30:19", "coaches are better really and I don't", "30:22", "necessary things are better but they're", "30:25", "more attentive mmm they're more", "30:27", "attentive to their fighters so they note", "30:29", "so if gusts were to leave his coaching T", "30:31", "his coaching staff I think he'd be a", "30:32", "worse fight I think he needs to keep his", "30:34", "coaching staff but maybe add something", "30:36", "else to it we spent some time in", "30:37", "alliance yeah and I think he needs he", "30:39", "needed that but what he might need are", "30:41", "just better partners mmm he might just", "30:44", "need a few better guys to give him some", "30:46", "different looks but I think the coaching", "30:48", "staff his coach staff is fine I've", "30:51", "worked with

coaches hmm", "31:00", "American coaches sometimes guy", "31:02", "there's a bunch of good guys in Rome I", "31:04", "don't need to tell you nothing you know", "31:06", "so I think that's the biggest difference", "31:08", "between like America and then like in", "31:10", "Europe they're more attentive do you", "31:12", "think kind of what is what's the reason", "31:14", "for that it's not many not many guys to", "31:17", "work with right you know so you know was", "31:21", "you go to the States here so big is you", "31:24", "go to our room there's one coach 20", "31:26", "fighters right the
