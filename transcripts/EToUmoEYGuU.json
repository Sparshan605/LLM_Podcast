people that are at", "07:29", "risk that's what I think really and let", "07:32", "people make their own choices mm-hmm you", "07:34", "know this the the idea that these", "07:36", "hospitals are going to be overwhelmed is", "07:38", "not true it's not correct luckily we're", "07:41", "very fortunate yeah and the idea that", "07:43", "we're gonna run out of ventilators", "07:44", "that's not true either right so and then", "07:47", "also if that doctor that worked with", "07:49", "Michael yo was telling you this before", "07:50", "we started and the doctor said that if", "07:52", "he put him on a ventilator he would die", "07:54", "because his body would stop trying to", "07:57", "breathe and it would just sort of give", "07:58", "up and this is what Michael", "08:00", "Yoos doctors told him and he survived", "08:03", "and then we're finding out that a lot of", "08:06", "people they put on ventilators don't", "08:07", "make it and I wonder if what he's saying", "08:10", "applies to those people right it was he", "08:13", "is a special case of why they didn't", "08:15", "want him on the ventilator no as doctors", "08:16", "just a wise guy he's just smart and just", "08:19", "figured it out well I mean I mean it's a", "08:22", "weird thing to think you know what what", "08:25", "if we hadn't done all of these measures", "08:26", "would the hospitals have because the", "08:28", "hospitals for a beat were crazy depends", "08:31", "on where you are yeah like if you're in", "08:32", "Queens yeah it was yeah sane yeah this", "08:35", "place is where it's horrible yeah", "08:36", "so like if you if we hadn't done these", "08:38", "things what would have the result of", "08:40", "them it's good question", "08:41", "you", "08:42", "I mean would we have achieved heard mom", "08:45", "immunity you know or would we have", "08:47", "achieved it quicker yeah that's you know", "08:49", "communities like sixty percent the", "08:51", "people have been infected and right then", "08:53", "the virus sort of dies off right you", "08:55", "know when you look at the Spanish flu", "08:57", "when you look at the history of that and", "09:00", "you know the places that did something", "09:03", "fared much better than the places that", "09:05", "didn't the end result was you know all", "09:07", "these people died it goes through the", "09:10", "same amount of time but just you have a", "09:12", "lot more fatalities you know and it's", "09:15", "this it's always been this kind of", "09:16", "calculation like you know people are", "09:18", "doing the math I feel like people are", "09:20", "doing the math and they're saying okay X", "09:23", "amount will die but we've got to get", "09:25", "back to work and get these people to", "09:27", "work and they're trying to figure out", "09:28", "that equation or there's the suffering", "09:30", "of the people that are probably going to", "09:31", "survive even if they get it is that", "09:34", "suffering going to be greater than the", "09:36", "suffering for families who lose people", "09:38", "right so that's that balancing act and", "09:41", "you can see where people are coming out", "09:43", "on it certain places are like no it's", "09:45", "just time to go and yeah there'll be", "09:47", "casualties but we'll deal and other", "09:50", "people are saying save lives at all cost", "09:52", "well if we say save lives at all costs", "09:54", "we should all stop driving I don't want", "09:57", "to do that - yeah I know what you're", "10:00", "saying yeah I mean right there's things", "10:02", "that are risk this is one of those", "10:03", "things that's a it's a uniquely human", "10:05", "problem because there's no real answer", "10:07", "for it because most human problems yeah", "10:11", "hmm yeah you know I mean yeah ya know", "10:14", "right you don't you kind of we are all", "10:18", "isolated on this one thing and then you", "10:20", "stop thinking well we live at risk all", "10:22", "day long yeah every day you know well", "10:25", "not only do we live at risk all day long", "10:28", "but we make decisions that could put", "10:31", "ourselves at risk and we're allowed to", "10:33", "make those decisions but with this", "10:35", "you're not allowed to make those", "10:36", "decisions and the ideas well because you", "10:38", "put others at risk okay", "10:40", "but who and why and do you know when do", "10:44", "we decide like how long can we go on", "10:46", "with this if we don't have any new tools", "10:48", "in July what is gonna be the difference", "10:50", "between
