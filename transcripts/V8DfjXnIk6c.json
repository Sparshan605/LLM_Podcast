nice though because then you get", "06:21", "the like reprieve of using different", "06:24", "muscles you're hiking muscles might be", "06:27", "different than like your flat running or", "06:29",

that for me they were helpful", "06:40", "I didn't use them until the probably", "06:43", "last quarter of the race really um and", "06:46", "they were helpful just as my feet were", "06:48", "becoming a little more tender and my", "06:51", "muscles not quite as quick to catch me", "06:53", "on the downhills and uphills just to", "06:55", "like disperse the effort a little bit to", "06:57", "my arms well Jamie pull up that video of", "07:00", "the what you know the sort of preview", "07:03", "video of the Moab 240 when they showed", "07:05", "all these people running over the top", "07:06", "there's some precarious section yeah", "07:09", "like and when you're tired you've", "07:11", "already run like 8090 miles then you hit", "07:14", "these crazy precarious sections like", "07:16", "what is that like that's like don't die", "07:19", "no one's there watching you saw you", "07:21", "running with runners right like this", "07:24", "would be a lonely death Moab 200", "07:26", "endurance run is 2 and 30 mile foot race", "07:28", "through some of Utah's most stunning and", "07:30", "challenging terrain and it really is", "07:32", "yeah it's so beautiful and so Salomon is", "07:36", "the sponsor of this they're the", "07:37", "presenting sponsor and then there's a", "07:39", "bunch of like sub sponsor I love their", "07:41", "trail shoes look at this section that is", "07:44", "insane this is the one that drives me", "07:45", "nuts it's like if you just stumble off", "07:47", "the side that's a wrap son yeah they're", "07:50", "making it look like so easy to run down", "07:53", "I'm pretty sure I was like stumbling my", "07:56", "way down that a lot less gracefully well", "07:59", "how come these guys can't do it the way", "08:01", "you do it like something's going on", "08:04", "because like this has got to be like", "08:06", "insane to for the other people that", "08:09", "we're running it that you win by these", "08:11", "giant margins yeah I don't know I think", "08:14", "you really don't know are you what is", "08:17", "your diet like oh yeah nachos yeah I", "08:29", "mean just a normal diet I don't restrict", "08:31", "or like try and include anything", "08:33", "different than the normal I guess the", "08:37", "average American Wow", "08:39", "so do you supplement with vitamins or do", "08:43", "you take anything else I take a", "08:45", "multivitamin that's it yeah Wow no", "08:48", "minerals nothing correct no creatine", "08:50", "nothing", "08:51", "no-no-no so just essentially a", "08:53", "multivitamin and just huffing it with", "08:55", "nachos in your belly yeah yeah that's", "08:59", "crazy like I would expect that someone", "09:02", "who is so far ahead of the rest of the", "09:05", "pack that you would have some like you", "09:07", "go to Colorado Springs the Olympic", "09:08", "Training Program and they get you hooked", "09:10", "up to these rocky 4 machines like they", "09:12", "had drunk oh the Russian guy stuff and", "09:15", "they got like a music video soundtrack", "09:17", "playing in the background to the best", "09:19", "[Laughter]", "09:23", "meanwhile you just drinking beer eating", "09:25", "nachos yeah", "09:27", "does it help living in Colorado like", "09:30", "you're at a good altitude right yeah", "09:32", "great altitude I think it probably helps", "09:34", "I mean I'm right outside Denver so", "09:37", "there's trails out my door so I that's", "09:39", "my like everyday run is on trails", "09:42", "climbing around the foothills of", "09:44", "Colorado so quite a bit of climbing", "09:46", "we're already at altitude so it's got a", "09:50", "it's got a help so talk me through your", "09:53", "preparation so when did it start like", "09:55", "when when did you sign up for this race", "09:57", "when did you know that you're going to", "09:59", "do it I signed up in May but I also was", "10:04", "signed up for a hundred mile race a", "10:06", "month prior to Moab in so like", "10:09", "mid-september and so my preparation was", "10:12", "mostly for that 100 mile race and then", "10:16", "after the hundred mile or it was just", "10:18", "trying to recover make sure my legs and", "10:21", "body felt fresh again and then got", "10:23", "squeezed in a couple more weeks of solid", "10:25", "training to get ready for my lab it's so", "10:27", "funny because you say 100 miles like", "10:29", "shit to me kill me", "10:37", "but I mean you saying that you ran 238", "10:40", "miles and then a hundred mile that", "10:43", "doesn't sound like much I know child's", "10:44", "play it's how long does it take you to", "10:47", "run hundred miles usually somewhere", "10:51", "around twenty four hours or under", "10:53", "depending on the trail and the climbing", "10:55", "and stuff so when you're getting ready", "10:56", "so you so you're preparing mostly for", "10:58", "the 100-mile race and then it's sort of", "11:00", "recovery and then the", "11:02", "100 mile race essentially get you in", "11:04", "condition for the 240 yeah that's what I", "11:06", "hoped is that it could be a good", "11:08", "springboard to the next one", "11:09", "so is that condition is that a mental", "11:12", "thing or are we talking about a physical", "11:14", "thing and a mental thing I think both", "11:17", "yeah your body I mean your body is", "11:19", "important so like the physical aspect is", "11:21", "important as well and just being able", "11:25", "like pound your legs for the amount of", "11:29", "time the amount of miles that you need", "11:30", "to for these races is physically learned", "11:33", "so what kind of daily miles were you", "11:35", "putting in when you're getting ready for", "11:37", "the 100 I would average about a hundred", "11:40", "miles per week so I don't know so that's", "11:44", "not even too crazy that's not too crazy", "11:46", "right because my friend cam Haines was", "11:49", "trying to do a marathon a day", "11:51", "yeah he's insane that's so cool is that", "11:54", "too much I mean no he was doing great", "11:57", "with it so well he came in a day later", "11:59", "than you keep it up you know what you", "12:04", "should do like 40 miles a day buddy", "12:07", "no I think it depends on people's bodies", "12:10", "like some some people a hundred miles", "12:12", "per week is a lot their bodies can't", "12:15", "sustain that and for some like campaigns", "12:17", "he can do a marathon a day and and be in", "12:20", "great physical form for it but he's a", "12:22", "meathead and I always wonder I love him", "12:24", "but I say this with all due respect I", "12:26", "wonder if like he pushes too hard like", "12:28", "maybe there's like a fine line between", "12:31", "there's like a point of diminishing", "12:33", "returns yeah yeah you know well you you", "12:35", "go so hard that you're kind of", "12:37", "overtraining and you know you can", "12:38", "sustain it really you get better", "12:40", "performance out of being like pushing", "12:43", "less right yeah I don't I can't speak to", "12:46", "to his training but I think he's pretty", "12:49", "he's pretty new to all these ultras as", "12:51", "well yeah I think so", "12:53", "over the last few years he did the Big", "12:55", "Foot 200 last year yeah it was just 205", "12:57", "miles he did that in 78 hours he", "13:00", "actually did this race two hours quicker", "13:02", "than he did the 205 which is so cool I'm", "13:04", "crazy yeah probably because he's just", "13:06", "humiliated by you", "13:11", "she beat me by a day so like forget", "13:14", "about the second-place person who you", "13:16", "could have taken a nice restful", "13:18", "eight-hour sleep", "13:19", "gotten a fine meal at a restaurant had a", "13:21", "glass of wine and took a shower and", "13:24", "brush your teeth painted your toenails", "13:27", "if you have any left do they all fall", "13:30", "off no still got ten really yeah cams", "13:33", "all fall off he takes pictures of malt", "13:35", "taped up oh really", "13:36", "disgusting so when you um when you're", "13:40", "recovering from something like this how", "13:42", "long does it take before you feel normal", "13:44", "again um after this one I felt like a", "13:47", "human so I finished Sunday night and I", "13:51", "felt human by Wednesday and got out for", "13:58", "some jogs then like Friday Saturday", "14:00", "really yeah", "14:02", "Wow I would be done with jogging forever", "14:06", "this is so stupid I just take a car next", "14:09", "time what so like when you say you felt", "14:13", "like a human again like what do you mean", "14:15", "by that", "14:16", "for me those first couple nights after I", "14:18", "don't sleep very well I think like", "14:20", "everything is just on overdrive my my", "14:23", "legs are throbbing and uncomfortable and", "14:26", "it's hard to like turn your brain off as", "14:28", "much as you want to so I was finally", "14:31", "like getting good normal sleep by", "14:33", "Wednesday and it kind of messed with my", "14:36", "appetite for a couple days as well where", "14:38", "food just like wasn't it didn't sound", "14:40", "that great even though I was like", "14:41", "totally depleted of nutrition yeah yeah", "14:45", "it's gotta be such a shock for your body", "14:47", "oh for sure who knows that's probably", "14:50", "not good for us but you can't be well I", "14:53", "say it can't be but maybe it can be", "14:55", "right because maybe you're recovering", "14:57", "and maybe when you recover from that", "15:00", "extreme exertion your vitality ups right", "15:03", "because like there's all these like", "15:05", "people that say you ever read this that", "15:08", "if you take a mat if you've run a", "15:10", "marathon you should take six months off", "15:12", "I've read that I actually read that like", "15:15", "someone's recommendation it takes you", "15:16", "six months to recover from marathan from", "15:18", "one marathon well who who you fatso yeah", "15:21", "who's saying this like obviously there's", "15:24", "people that can do more than you like", "15:25", "people people who are writing this stuff", "15:27", "down or silly cuz no because cam can if", "15:30", "he can run a marathon a day obviously he", "15:32", "doesn't need six months off right and", "15:33", "I've hung out with him after he's done", "15:35", "this and he's totally normal yeah like", "15:36", "it doesn't seem like there's anything", "15:37", "wrong with them so that's not true so", "15:40", "the question is like who are we", "15:42", "comparing to like who's our baseline is", "15:44", "our baseline like a guy who barely works", "15:47", "out or is our baseline you cuz you're", "15:48", "gonna get two radically different", "15:50", "results right gotta take those articles", "15:52", "with a grain of salt yeah but that's the", "15:54", "thing what I was saying to Kim I was", "15:56", "like well how do you know how much to", "15:58", "Train II was no one knows how much to", "15:59", "train for this stuff cuz it's really", "16:00", "just guesswork yeah yeah which is part", "16:03", "of the cool part you know it's like", "16:04", "there's a million pieces to the puzzle", "16:07", "of ultrarunning and and figuring them", "16:10", "out is part of the fun of doing this", "16:12", "sport now what has it been like for you", "16:15", "after you won because you're like I've", "16:18", "talked to so many people that really", "16:21", "have no interest", "16:22", "normally in endurance running and", "16:24", "they've brought you up constantly like", "16:27", "you're like a superstar it's good so I'm", "16:30", "sure sounds crazy to you but like my", "16:33", "friend Brian Stephens he was texting me", "16:35", "the whole way back and forth while this", "16:37", "was going on and you know he was like", "16:38", "looking at your numbers and your times", "16:40", "he's like this is fucking insane I think", "16:42", "this woman is insane like how is she", "16:44", "doing this well thank you they had a", "16:46", "good tracking system that was so yeah", "16:50", "yeah that's what Brian was saying he's", "16:51", "like I've never been less productive", "16:52", "rings I'm just going online and checking", "16:55", "this thing constantly um yeah I mean", "16:59", "since then I had to create a Twitter", "17:02", "have any social media Instagram I had a", "17:05", "Facebook but that's how you were", "17:07", "successful I don't know you

so", "17:17", "don't don't bother just occasionally", "17:20", "post things and just ignore everything", "17:21", "else yeah yeah I'll just retweet a few", "17:24", "things that's the moon just learning", "17:26", "about those yeah", "17:27", "that's that we treat but whenever", "17:29", "anything's interesting that's a good", "17:30", "move yeah so like when you when you", "17:34", "finish the race like what is the feeling", "17:36", "like when you cross the line and you", "17:37", "look back and you don't even see a", "17:39", "person like you you wouldn't be able to", "17:42", "see them with fucking binoculars like", "17:44", "they're on the other side of the earth", "17:45", "like the curve of the earth if you", "17:47", "believe that thing the curve of the", "17:49", "earth is literally so far like they", "17:52", "they're beyond the curve that's true", "17:55", "right isn't it twenty miles I would", "17:58", "imagine you can't see straight twenty", "18:00", "miles", "18:00", "I would imagine twenty miles you might", "18:02", "be able to see like the top a dude's", "18:03", "head and he's like you'd have to have", "18:07", "them crazy by nose and you could", "18:10", "probably see him but yeah if your", "18:11", "glasses glasses I mean what is that", "18:15", "feeling like it felt amazing you know", "18:18", "with the tracking system that we had", "18:21", "when I left the last aid station there's", "18:24", "like 17 miles to go", "18:27", "and it was pretty much we could see that", "18:30", "it was certain that I could get to the", "18:34", "line first as long as I didn't like take", "18:36", "a nap out there right or become like", "18:39", "physically incapable but you could take", "18:41", "a nap that was the thing did we take a",

"25:18", "fascinated to know like what is what's", "25:21", "happening that's right causing you to", "25:23", "have these like extreme visual", "25:24", "hallucinations cuz you you're saying", "25:27", "they looked real yeah but I think it's", "25:30", "just like shadows and your brain is too", "25:33", "tired to like process so it just like", "25:35", "jumbles them together into

"26:12", "running right and you're running for 50", "26:14", "whatever miles or 58 and hours and", "26:16", "you're constantly moving forward is", "26:19", "there a point in time where you", "26:21", "like like what does it feel like do you", "26:25", "like in constant pain or are you just", "26:28", "numb to it like what happens um it's", "26:31", "kind of you go in waves like you'll be",

"26:44", "know everything's feeling really good", "26:45", "and then that wave will eventually come", "26:48", "crashing down where things are hurting", "26:50", "again and you might be like whimpering", "26:52", "along for a little bit but the cool part", "26:55", "about these is that those waves like I", "26:57", "mean they always come and then they they", "27:00", "go so you ride this

soon you just got to", "27:12", "keep chugging along so you're in pain", "27:14", "and then somehow or another you feel", "27:16", "better even though you don't stop", "27:17", "running yeah yeah how does it work I", "27:19", "don't know like a switch flips or", "27:21", "sometimes I'll like intentionally during", "27:24", "those lows take more calories in", "27:26", "thinking maybe that will help just like", "27:28", "give my body some something to burn for", "27:32", "a while to make it happy again what kind", "27:34", "of stuff can you eat while you're", "27:35", "running this much in one this length I", "27:39", "was doing a lot of like water gatorade", "27:42", "and then there's this powder you can put", "27:44", "in water called tailwind it has like", "27:47", "electrolytes and 200 calories per bottle", "27:50", "so you're getting in calories and then", "27:53", "like normal athletic foods like honey", "27:57", "stinger products which are like gels and", "27:59", "and shoes and

"just keep running yeah so I would stop", "28:23", "it each aid station demolished a cheese", "28:26", "quesadilla like hang out for just a", "28:28", "second to let my body reset and then", "28:31", "keep cruising Wow which normally I'm not", "28:34", "very good at eating real food during but", "28:36", "this just felt like too much there's cam", "28:38", "with a bacon cheeseburger yeah cover", "28:41", "your blanket oh that's another thing", "28:43", "like there's points in the race where", "28:44", "it's extremely cold right it got really", "28:46", "cold I think we hit 9 degrees on the", "28:49", "second night and what are you wearing um", "28:52", "a couple jackets like a windbreaker", "28:55", "jacket and a rain jacket and some gloves", "28:57", "and like a headband some pants", "29:01", "nothing like absurd so just the fact", "29:03", "you're constantly moving you stay fairly", "29:05", "warm yeah and the windbreaker is the", "29:08", "rain jacket to stop rain or from wind",

doesn't", "29:39", "have to just food just goes in and just", "29:42", "do something yeah yeah it's not the case", "29:45", "with you too", "29:47", "yeah no bring him but he said he didn't", "29:52",

for a", "30:13", "while I was peeing like way too much", "30:15", "like multiple times per mile and I think", "30:19", "it has something to do with the amount", "30:21", "of salt thank you that was another", "30:23", "question I had do you take in salt", "30:25", "tablets I wasn't until I was having this", "30:28", "this problem and then it was like we", "30:30", "gotta try and stop this cuz that's not", "30:32", "good either to go as often has that yeah", "30:35", "so then I took some salt tabs whatever", "30:38", "nails did that clear it up yep", "30:41", "now what are those like do you know what", "30:42", "milligrams how much salt you're actually", "30:44", "taking", "30:45", "nope No so they're just like SS caps or", "30:48", "something they're just a normal like you", "30:51", "can buy them at any any athletic store", "30:54", "oh so this is just a little pill of salt", "30:56", "I think it's just mostly for runners", "30:58", "essentially that's all I've seen use", "31:01", "them but you could you could probably", "31:03", "have some if you wanted what's the", "31:07", "thought process behind it though the top", "31:09", "process is that your body is pushing", "31:11", "through all these minerals into the salt", "31:13", "helps you retain water yeah yeah and", "31:15", "what about other minerals do you have to", "31:17", "take magnesium or anything else why are", "31:19", "you doing that I didn't know and I don't", "31:21", "even really know the the exact contents", "31:24", "of that Tailwind", "31:25", "powder that I was putting in I know it", "31:27", "has lots of electrolytes and stuff like", "31:30", "that that's supposed to help but I'm not", "31:31", "sure if it has some of the other pieces", "31:34", "that people need during these now before", "31:37", "the race gets started do you hyper", "31:38", "hydrate but you do like drink a ton of", "31:40", "water to get ready or yeah I tried I", "31:43", "mean nothing too crazy too crazy", "31:46",

and kick everybody's ass", "32:14", "it was exciting I mean it was this big", "32:16", "adventure that I had I had high", "32:20", "expectations of myself while at the same", "32:22", "time having no expectations of myself", "32:24", "because I didn't know I didn't know how", "32:26", "it was gonna go and I really wanted to", "32:29", "just enjoy being out there like moving", "32:31", "my body with my feet for multiple days", "32:34", "was really exciting and so I was pumped", "32:37", "at the at the beginning and spent those", "32:39", "first probably 50 miles like running", "32:42", "with various people through the desert", "32:44", "there's like canyon walls just like", "32:46", "towering on every side and just trying", "32:49", "to enjoy that like this is just the", "32:52",

her describe it", "45:05", "because it sounds pretty crazy what", "45:07", "happened so the hundred mile race that I", "45:11", "was doing a months before Moab at about", "45:14", "I mean 12 miles roughly to the finish", "45:17", "line my vision started blurring like in", "45:20", "the periphery and over the course of the", "45:23", "next couple miles closed in until it was", "45:27", "pure white I couldn't see anything so I", "45:30", "just like stumbled my way along roughly", "45:34", "ten miles of trails to get to the finish", "45:36", "line pretty much I would say like 98%", "45:39", "blind what I could see my feet like", "45:42", "right in front of my feet but it was", "45:44", "just whiteout", "45:45", "so I was running and falling everywhere", "45:49", "it was probably hilarious if people were", "45:52", "watching but I hit my head also on a", "45:55", "rock well do you blind yeah", "45:58", "one of the times I fell so I had blood", "46:00", "dripping down my face like stumbling", "46:02", "along totally couldn't see the trail you", "46:05", "still won", "46:06", "yeah managed to finish and and hold the", "46:08", "lead you're a savage you should give", "46:10", "seminars on how to be a savage that is", "46:13", "crazy so what what did what happened to", "46:16", "your vision so since the", "46:18", "there's been tons of people kind of", "46:20", "talking about it apparently it happens", "46:22", "in ultras quite often they are thinking", "46:25", "it's a corneal edema so basically like I", "46:28", "wear contact lenses to see and the like", "46:33", "contact mixed with the air and the", "46:36", "dryness and mm-hmm all sorts of things", "46:39", "cause like a kind of fluid or I'm not", "46:41", "really sure how it works have you ever", "46:43", "thought about getting lasix or something", "46:44", "people who have done LASIK also get this", "46:47", "corneal edema so for now I'm just", "46:50", "staying staying with the contacts cuz", "46:53", "I've I've been learning how to deal with", "46:55", "those a little bit better well did that", "46:58", "concern you at all when you're about to", "47:00", "run 238 miles yeah I really didn't want", "47:05", "to go blind again oh Jesus Christ", "47:08", "but I especially at that course yeah", "47:10", "yeah right off a cliff yeah oh I was", "47:13", "using eye drops I'm just like get some", "47:17", "like tears going in there and I wore", "47:20", "glasses for this whole race in my lab", "47:23", "because that's supposed to help as well", "47:25", "keep grit from hitting yeah yeah now", "47:28", "when you got back and you won that race", "47:30", "and you were basically almost blind how", "47:33", "long did it take for your vision to", "47:34", "recover five six hours oh that's it yeah", "47:37", "oh that must've been a relief oh such a", "47:40", "relief yeah I was pretty sick of it by", "47:42", "the time I finished we concerned that it", "47:44", "could be potentially permanent you know", "47:46", "it didn't feel permanent it felt I think", "47:49", "because it went white and because it", "47:50", "like moved in slowly it felt like", "47:53", "topical I don't know I didn't I didn't", "47:56", "really consider while I was racing if it", "47:58", "was permanent I was just like amped on", "48:01", "finishing the race at that point but", "48:04", "once I finished no one seemed overly", "48:06", "concerned about it like we went to the", "48:08", "hospital and they were more concerned", "48:11", "with checking out my head so it didn't", "48:14", "feel like that urgent whoa yeah but it", "48:17", "was weird yeah did you think about", "48:19", "quitting no yeah even though you're", "48:24", "blind and you got a concussion", "48:26", "you look like Kerry", "48:30", "what the hell well I hit my head and it", "48:33", "funked pretty hard and then there was", "48:35", "liquid dripping on my face but I put my", "48:38", "hand up to touch it and I couldn't see", "48:40", "my hand in front of my face to see if it", "48:42", "was blood or not", "48:43", "Wow I had no idea and what is this", "48:46", "course like that you're running on um", "48:48", "it's in steamboat Colorado so mountains", "48:51", "and pretty rough trails on this section", "48:54", "where I fell yeah but the last six miles", "48:59", "of the race you finally get to like a", "49:01", "fire road so a little bit wider a little", "49:04", "more room for error you go cricked", "49:08", "that's just so crazy so how how are you", "49:10", "knowing where to step you're not you're", "49:12", "just guessing so that's a picture of the", "49:15", "course yeah so you're running that", "49:17", "course blind", "49:18", "well that sections quite a bit more", "49:20", "technical than the section I went blind", "49:22", "on when you say technical what exactly", "49:25", "do you mean like big rocks and cliffs", "49:27", "stuff like that the second why would it", "49:29", "be why would that be technical um I", "49:31", "don't know that's just the word they", "49:33", "associate with like trickier trails mmm", "49:35", "like you have to be more used technique", "49:38", "is that what they're saying maybe I've", "49:41", "heard that term before this one I always", "49:42", "asked yeah like people talk about like", "49:44", "technical terrain like deep you know I", "49:46", "don't know what it I don't know the root", "49:48", "word for it I guess you just can't just", "49:52", "flat out just hoof it you have to think", "49:54", "about what you're doing", "49:55", "yeah like your foot placement is a", "49:57", "little bit tricky you're kind of looking", "49:59", "down a lot while you having yeah I can't", "50:01", "just run straight right right like as", "50:04", "most people like if you're running on a", "50:05", "flat trail you're just kind of looking", "50:08", "ahead and you're assuming the road is", "50:09", "gonna be the same with the left foot as", "50:11", "it is for the right foot and the left", "50:12", "right this you can't right yeah now when", "50:16", "you're doing something like that I would", "50:17", "think well you gotta constantly look", "50:19", "down that is when I would be concerned", "50:21", "about like mountain lions yeah cuz", "50:23", "you're not looking", "50:24", "yeah and they probably think you're", "50:26", "trying to get away right yeah I'm pretty", "50:30", "sure if you end up seeing the mountain", "50:32", "lion it's already too late for you oh", "50:34", "really", "50:34", "I know did you

literally think it was", "71:14", "physically impossible roger bannister", "71:16", "thank you", "71:17", "but once he broke it then a bunch of", "71:18", "people broke words they realized it", "71:20", "could be possible you know which is", "71:22", "another one of the reasons why when", "71:24", "someone says oh if you run a marathon", "71:26", "you have to take six months off like", "71:28", "fuck up nobody knows what people can do", "71:31", "it's really true that there's there are", "71:34", "boundaries to human performance that", "71:35", "have not been explored yet I agree",

"71:48", "history I don't think there's a whole", "71:51", "lot of people that can ever say that", "71:53", "they've run 238 my bet there's maybe one", "71:57", "or two other people that have ever", "71:58", "walked the face of the earth that have", "72:01", "done what you did", "72:01", "they might not have error I mean maybe", "72:04", "this like some crazy Aborigine or some", "72:07", "indigenous people that we don't know", "72:08", "about someone who lives in Mexico in the", "72:10", "mountains or something like that has", "72:11", "done something crazy like this but for", "72:13", "the most part I mean how many people", "72:15", "have ever done what you did I think", "72:17", "there were 95 finishers at the lab 240", "72:20", "but how many people have done it in less", "72:21", "than 58 hours this year just one but I", "72:25", "think it'll keep falling that's why my", "72:28", "thought process yeah and do you think", "72:30", "that there's anything left do you think", "72:34", "you left anything on the table as far as", "72:36", "like when you cross the line was there a", "72:39", "thought like I could have done that", "72:40", "maybe like five minutes faster yeah", "72:42", "I mean sure yeah you can cut out time at", "72:46", "aid stations you can do sections more", "72:49", "efficiently so I've my hope is there's", "72:52", "always room for improvement and and if I", "72:54", "went back next year I would absolutely", "72:56", "be trying to to push the pace and and", "72:59", "drop my time what would you try to get", "73:01", "it under 50 I don't know I think I just", "73:03", "have to see how the day was unfolding", "73:05", "and like what sort of obstacles were", "73:07", "coming out that if you did it under 50 I", "73:09",

"74:46", "everyone in this in this group course", "74:49", "yeah talking psycho I know yeah and she", "74:52", "was saying maybe 2019 she'd be able to", "74:54", "pull it together", "74:55", "oh why does she need that much time I", "74:58", "mean the logistics involved and then", "75:00", "there's like permitting you have to do", "75:01", "and where would you would she have one", "75:04", "of these things yeah she didn't say how", "75:06", "about the surface of the Sun yeah it's", "75:10", "cold", "75:11", "[Laughter]", "75:16", "gravity you'd be like cheating like 1/6", "75:20", "1/6 Earth's gravity yeah I mean I just I", "75:24", "wonder like what is the limit like what", "75:27", "is the limit of a human yeah in terms of", "75:29", "like I mean you said that when it was", "75:32", "over you were wrecked for days you you", "75:34", "couldn't sleep you really weren't eating", "75:36", "well but when you cross that finish line", "75:39", "and if someone said okay the real finish", "75:43", "line is another 80 miles you just would", "75:47", "have kept going yeah if that's if that", "75:50", "was real and I had 80 more miles to", "75:53", "cover I would figure out how to do it", "75:55", "whatever is 180 how many more miles do", "75:58", "you think you have left in your body I", "75:59", "mean there's there a point where you're", "76:01", "just tissue would just give out maybe", "76:04", "yeah um but like for this 500-mile race", "76:09", "she's suggesting there's like a she's", "76:11", "thinking a 10 day cutoff or whatever Oh", "76:13", "God", "76:14", "you know so then you just gotta build in", "76:16", "some good sleep and yeah sorry Candace", "76:19", "if we weren't supposed to talk about", "76:20", "this yeah we're talking about it that's", "76:24", "like that's ten days is not well I guess", "76:29", "but no one's gonna do that right you're", "76:31", "just gonna keep running no one's gonna", "76:32", "just go 50 miles a day right you could", "76:35", "what's that in your plan yeah but no", "76:38", "one's gonna do that I mean for this one", "76:40", "people had sleep plans there's aid", "76:42", "stations out there that have like cots",

I", "76:54", "don't know if they just want to keep", "76:55", "turning them over in case there's a need", "76:57", "for more that makes sense", "76:59", "so they wake you up at six hours", "77:00",

it's over yeah", "77:13", "so I guess for this one they'd have to", "77:15", "have sleep stations out there and I mean", "77:18", "I think what I'm getting at is the", "77:20", "fascinating part of this to me is that", "77:22", "the boundaries are at least somewhat", "77:26", "unexplored because what you did was in a", "77:31", "way very revolutionary like what you did", "77:34", "is like like you just you just flipped", "77:36", "the whole thing on its head by coming in", "77:38", "10 hours and 20 plus miles ahead of the", "77:43", "second place person like now people are", "77:45", "gonna go okay well what what's possible", "77:48", "because maybe there's someone out there", "77:49", "that could do that @courtney yeah", "77:51", "absolutely there is glue I haven't met", "77:55", "them really exists I don't know that's", "77:58", "the question that's the cool part is if", "78:00", "people just keep like wondering that", "78:03", "then yeah I mean we'll be breaking down", "78:05", "all sorts of barriers that's what's", "78:07", "fascinating about it to me as a", "78:09", "completely outside observer is that what", "78:12", "you're doing is it's you're essentially", "78:16", "in unexplored territory and even the", "78:18", "training protocols right like your", "78:20", "protocols different than cams and I'm", "78:22", "sure that Sean God's got a different", "78:24", "thing that he did and everybody's got", "78:26", "their own little methods you know and", "78:27", "wasn't there a guy that was leading for", "78:29", "a while but he had a he had a bail at", "78:30", "like 150 miles he couldn't take it", "78:32", "anymore", "78:33", "yep so I was going back and forth for a", "78:34", "while with a guy until maybe yeah I", "78:38", "think it was 150 miles what happened to", "78:40", "him", "78:40", "I'm not sure I think his legs or his", "78:43", "quads or something was given out I'm not", "78:45", "positive I didn't get to have a", "78:47", "conversation with him and does that", "78:49", "happen often where someone just comes", "78:51", "out of the gate too hard or maybe like", "78:53", "he's trying to keep up with you", "78:54", "and he outpaced himself yeah", "78:57", "unfortunately they're called DNFs or did", "79:00", "not finish and those happen pretty", "79:03", "frequently like what's the percentage of", "79:05", "you out of gas it was a hundred plus", "79:06", "people entered right yeah I think this", "79:09", "the 200 the Moab race had way less than", "79:13", "a normal like hundred mile race for", "79:15", "example we left DNFs way less people", "79:17", "dropped out yeah", "79:18", "interesting I don't know if it's like", "79:20", "the mindset going in you just know it's", "79:22", "this big adventure and you're gonna be", "79:25", "out there for multiple days so you're", "79:26", "ready for that versus a hundred mile", "79:29", "race I mean people are breaking down", "79:31", "barriers with how fast those can be done", "79:33", "yeah and so then you're you're going out", "79:36", "guns blazing from the start and and then", "79:38", "you've got a higher potential for a blow", "79:41", "up that just can't be fixed hmm so is", "79:44", "that what happens like you your muscles", "79:45", "just break down you get what does it", "79:48", "call the autologous or something like", "79:49", "that your muscles start eating", "79:51", "themselves yeah and just like no", "79:52", "response you're getting nothing back", "79:54", "from them yeah and what is that thing", "79:57", "that those CrossFit people get robbed oh", "79:59", "my losses oh yeah yeah do you ever get", "80:02", "that I've never gotten robbed Oh", "80:05", "rhabdomyolysis yeah something about like", "80:07", "your muscles are breaking down into your", "80:09", "bloodstream or yeah yeah that's not good", "80:12", "it's supposed to be horrible yeah and", "80:14", "apparently like way more common today", "80:16", "than a muscle breakdown damages the", "80:19", "kidneys apparently it's way more common", "80:22", "today because of these CrossFit classes", "80:25", "and you know people push themselves and", "80:28", "push that's the thing is like it's not a", "80:30", "matter of what's possible like hey", "80:32", "Courtney ran 248 miles I can run it too", "80:35", "well yeah maybe but you're gonna have to", "80:38", "build up to that stupid just do it", "80:41", "tomorrow you know that's kind of the", "80:43", "crazy thing about all this right is that", "80:45", "like you're you're building like a", "80:48", "mountain one Lego block at a time right", "80:51", "and and someone who's like oh well her", "80:54", "mountains like 5,000 feet high I'll just", "80:56", "fucking build a foot know it takes a", "80:58", "long ass time to build that mountain", "81:01", "right yeah I mean for me I've been I've", "81:03", "been training for this long stuff for", "81:05", "seven years now so I wasn't like", "81:09", "instantly successful at the hundred mile", "81:11", "distance and it's taken a lot of", "81:13", "training and a lot of just learning", "81:15", "along the way now because of the fact", "81:19", "that you ran this 238 mile race at a", "81:22", "certain pace and you did so phenomenally", "81:24", "do you feel like your body is now going", "81:26", "to be stronger for the next one I hope", "81:29", "so I hope if I treat it nicely for", "81:32", "little bit here and let it fully recover", "81:34", "but then I can try and springboard off", "81:37", "of this for the next thing plenty nachos", "81:39", "plenty of beer", "81:40", "yeah slowed it in now do you do any", "81:43", "other kind of training do you do any", "81:45", "weight lifting or yoga or anything else", "81:48", "you incorporate anything else yeah I do", "81:50", "I go to the gym mostly at the gym I do", "81:53", "core work and like throw throw around a", "81:56", "couple five pound dumbbells but", "82:01", "otherwise no I", "82:02", "I think yoga would be a great thing to", "82:04", "incorporate I just haven't I haven't", "82:06", "gotten motivated to head to those", "82:09", "classes you had that's so funny", "82:11", "now do you stretch sometimes but", "82:17", "wouldn't you like think that that would", "82:19", "be a good thing to do I mean oh", "82:20", "absolutely", "82:21", "why don't you do it I mean I try yeah", "82:24", "it's just not like incorporated into my", "82:27", "normal routine very well mm-hmm do you", "82:30", "think maybe like things along those", "82:31", "lines like maybe yoga or weightlifting", "82:33", "or stretching would maybe possibly", "82:35", "advance you to another level yeah I mean", "82:38", "I might as well try and see yeah but", "82:40", "that's what I'm think I'm like you're so", "82:42", "far ahead now that I would imagine it's", "82:46", "a matter of like what could possibly", "82:49", "make you better like you're you're", "82:51", "obviously too four to win by that", "82:54", "extrema margin like I would think", "82:57", "obviously what you're doing now is", "82:59", "amazing like what if it ain't broke", "83:00", "don't fix it right but are you at your", "83:05", "very best um I hope not I'm gonna keep", "83:09", "trying to strive for higher just keep", "83:12", "putting Lego blocks up yeah keep", "83:14", "building yeah but it seems like it's a", "83:20", "fairly good analogy", "83:22", "you know that it seems that it's a slow", "83:24", "arduous process of improvement and it", "83:27", "takes discipline and constant focus and", "83:30", "constant attention and just time in yeah", "83:33", "and enjoying it too like that's a huge", "83:36", "part of it for me as well as I'm loving", "83:38", "it still so but is it you think that's", "83:40", "part of the success as well the", "83:42", "enthusiasm that you have I think it's", "83:43", "gotta be if", "83:45", "if you're out there grinding everyday", "83:46", "for hours and you're just hating it I", "83:49", "mean right then you won't be jazz to go", "83:51", "to any starting line", "83:53", "yeah well that's like sort of what you", "83:54", "were saying about the water thing that", "83:57", "if you're low on water like don't just", "83:58", "don't let it freak you out", "84:00", "yeah just deal with it and it'll be less", "84:02", "like God that really does apply to life", "84:04", "doesn't it I think so yeah yeah no", "84:08", "matter if you run or not I think I'm", "84:10", "just figuring out how to deal with", "84:12", "situations like that without freaking", "84:15", "out and having a record day is huge now", "84:18", "what about runner's high how how do you", "84:20", "get when you run in like that is that", "84:22", "real yeah I mean I get it I just get", "84:25", "tired yeah sure yeah I mean when you're", "84:32", "out there like cruising along some", "84:34", "beautiful trails and you're in an", "84:37", "amazing place and you feel really good", "84:40", "and maybe you're with people or maybe", "84:42", "not it definitely can feel really", "84:44", "awesome", "84:46", "but people like sort of taste that down", "84:49", "right there's some people that that is", "84:51", "like the only way they stay sane I think", "84:53", "they got to go out and get their", "84:54", "medicine yeah yeah I'm not running do", "84:58", "you have like an end goal like do you do", "85:01", "that do you look at like this running", "85:03", "career and go okay I'm gonna get to be X", "85:06", "amount of age I want to accomplish a", "85:08", "certain amount of things and then stop", "85:10", "or is it just life ya life this is life", "85:16", "yeah the cool part about this running", "85:18", "stuff I mean you alluded to it earlier", "85:20", "but people in their 40s and 50s and 60s", "85:24", "they're doing these races and still", "85:26", "enjoying the trails and I hope to I hope", "85:30", "to still be doing it one in 20 years and", "85:32", "30 years my friend Ari his dad who is a", "85:36", "Holocaust survivor who's 80 years old", "85:38", "just ran a marathon in six hours Wow", "85:41", "fucking's that's amazing", "85:44", "good I mean
