"44:50", "eight consciousnesses I think it's eight", "44:55", "and the sixth one is your thought a", "44:57", "continuum of thoughts right so that's", "44:59", "like where most people hang out and they", "45:01", "think that's who they are is the", "45:02", "infinite cycle of repeating thoughts in", "45:05", "their head so below that as your senses", "45:08", "and then the one right above that is the", "45:12", "seventh and that's what is considered", "45:13", "your subconscious in the West but so", "45:17", "that's where all your memories are", "45:19", "that's where all your like just all the", "45:23", "shit you can't remember that happened to", "45:26", "you that that it's stuck back there that", "45:29", "appears in people's ARP or appears in", "45:31", "your neurosis or whatever and then above", "45:34", "that is the 8th consciousness and that's", "45:37", "the stored experience of all human", "45:40", "beings and well it's happening it's like", "45:43", "the global mind or its lyric records", "45:46", "yeah we have the Akashic records yeah", "45:48", "and and so basically that one drips down", "45:51", "like like water and a cave it drips down", "45:54", "into your subconscious which drips down", "45:57", "into your thoughts so when you're having", "45:59", "these thoughts according to this model", "46:01", "it's not necessarily your thoughts", "46:04", "you're getting a kind of distillate", "46:06", "that's rolling down through the global", "46:09", "mind being flavored by your subconscious", "46:13", "and then being flavored by your identity", "46:16", "or who you think you are", "46:17", "and then so by the time it comes out of", "46:19", "you it's got you wrapped up inside of it", "46:22", "but it's a projection of some like", "46:25", "shared mind it's pretty cool that makes", "46:29", "that makes actual sense you know that", "46:32", "sounds like crazy voodoo hippie talk but", "46:34", "it actually makes sense yeah that we all", "46:37", "know that there's something that we", "46:39", "share the Sun and we we all feed off of", "46:42", "each other I mean you know I've said", "46:44", "this many times and I am a different", "46:45", "person with you yeah", "46:47", "like we're different together and we're", "46:49", "different with other people as well I", "46:50", "mean that's how human beings are then we", "46:52", "when we interact with each other we have", "46:54", "this a bonding thing there's a there's", "46:57", "an interaction thing yeah and that's why", "47:00", "some people are toxic for you I mean the", "47:02", "idea that you're supposed to stay with", "47:03", "everyone it's like crazy like some", "47:05", "people are just not good for you it's", "47:06", "not a good mix you know you're not good", "47:08", "for

"47:35", "bet yeah yeah man I mean it's probably a", "47:38", "great way to swap organisms to keep them", "47:39", "spreading I mean yeah it benefits your", "47:42", "biome I feel like he wants to like", "47:44", "pollinate or get out into the world for", "47:47", "sure I was reading about", "47:48", "I was listening or actually listening to", "47:50", "a podcast the Stephen Rinella podcast",

smart people think that we", "112:46", "should keep open the possibility that", "112:49", "that is what we're operating under or", "112:51", "that the stability and the rigidity of", "112:55", "the

that's", "113:47", "what's causing depression and elation", "113:50", "and dopamine and serotonin and all these", "113:52", "different wonderful things it's what", "113:53", "caused melatonin it's all these", "113:56", "different things that happen when you're", "113:57", "sleeping and then the psychedelic ones", "113:59", "like the DMT who's to say that we have", "114:02", "to exist with this mixture right who's", "114:05", "to say that life with a thicker mixture", "114:08", "isn't also possible and might be going", "114:12", "on around us all the time like there", "114:14", "might be these porous sort of entry ways", "114:19", "into these other dimensions that are", "114:22", "consistently open and closed and they're", "114:24", "constantly around us all the time but", "114:26",

"114:35", "that this is reality this is rigid this", "114:38", "is it but maybe it's a reality yeah", "114:42", "there's a fuckload of them maybe when", "114:44", "you make decisions you enter into",

"are the way you navigate through the", "114:56", "multiverse it's entirely possible yeah", "114:58", "yeah man I don't say that too many times", "115:00", "well we it is a thing if you if you if", "115:04", "you just think about how little we", "115:06", "understand about consciousness about", "115:09", "what happens when you die what happens", "115:11", "when you sleep well how little we know", "115:13", "about what what is going on when you're", "115:15", "communicating with people what is going", "115:17", "on when you're interacting with what we", "115:19", "are these fucking ideas coming from yeah", "115:21", "are these ideas little life-form", "115:24", "in an anon observed state yeah man bro", "115:30", "you take off the glasses", "115:31", "I just realized I don't get to look at", "115:33", "your beautiful eyes Joey I was enjoying", "115:34", "this we did it for hours um stop right", "115:39", "here", "115:39", "that but that you know man like the when", "115:43", "you start the thing you're saying about", "115:44", "psychedelics kind of like showing you a", "115:46", "different way and that when you're in a", "115:47", "base reality state you people spend a", "115:50", "lot of energy trying to imagine a", "115:53", "solidity that isn't really there and", "115:56", "like you know as I've been taught by", "115:59", "some people that you know you if you", "116:03", "start breaking it down just logically", "116:06", "for exactly", "116:08", "you know your past for example you know", "116:10", "you ever do that spend any time with", "116:11", "your memories and you realize like well", "116:13", "no your most vivid memory whatever it", "116:16", "may be", "116:16", "mm-hmm you can't really taste what", "116:20", "you're eating or feel the euphoria that", "116:24", "you were feeling or the fear you were", "116:25", "feeling or whatever because if you did", "116:27", "then you the memory would not work for a", "116:29", "person who was trying to like stay alive", "116:31", "because you if you just remember the", "116:33", "last time you got punched in the face", "116:35", "you would feel it you know and also if", "116:37", "you could remember tastes you wouldn't", "116:39", "be so inclined to eat because you could", "116:41", "just go back and think to the last", "116:42", "chocolate bar you a and you would taste", "116:44",

"116:53", "would come you would feel like you're", "116:54", "coming so if we look at memories", "116:56", "experientially there's a lot of like", "116:58", "senses that aren't gratified by memory", "117:00", "and also if you look at them from the", "117:02", "visual field even the most profoundly", "117:05", "quote photographic memory is wavery at", "117:08", "best it's not HD it certainly wouldn't", "117:11", "be a 4k TV it's got it kind of like", "117:15", "quality to it that it's just you know it", "117:17", "flow it's just a little transparent so", "117:20", "then when we think about the future", "117:23", "obviously that doesn't exist like it's", "117:25", "there's no future", "117:26", "that's nothing is outside of this point", "117:29", "in time and so then now you've basically", "117:32", "just from a simple analysis of your", "117:35", "memories which a lot of people imagine", "117:36", "that's who they are like", "117:38", "they're a snake in the present moments", "117:40", "the head in the back is the past with", "117:43", "all their memories sort of intertwine", "117:44", "but you realize like no that's really", "117:47", "foggy approximation of what happened at", "117:49", "best and you really don't remember most", "117:51", "of the shit you did anyway like you", "117:54", "don't remember what you ate three days", "117:55", "ago ten days ago so then you realize", "117:58", "your whole past the thing you've been", "117:59", "using to define yourself as a person you", "118:02", "barely remember in the parts you do", "118:04", "remember it they're not really clear so", "118:07", "that's gone now that's death you're dead", "118:09", "anything that happened before this", "118:11", "moment that's death it's gone there's", "118:13", "just this for real that's not now there", "118:15", "might be some neurological encoding but", "118:17", "there's no past forget it that's why", "118:19", "people like to get really good at things", "118:20", "you know well you mean it gives them a", "118:23", "sense of stability that's why if you", "118:26", "have a physical skill like say you could", "118:29", "do gymnastics like yeah you
