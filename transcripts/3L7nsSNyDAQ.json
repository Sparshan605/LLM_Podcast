"21:48", "I mean other than that how the fuck else", "21:50", "could you simulate movement unless you", "21:52", "just did it inside like the virtual", "21:54", "reality done wouldn't even be virtual", "21:55", "anymore", "21:55", "you'd have to do it inside like put a", "21:58", "program and then make a program the", "22:00", "exact parameters of say an airplane", "22:02", "hangar right
