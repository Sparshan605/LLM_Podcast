wasn't", "99:59", "based on voting it's gonna start with", "100:02", "that yeah and and and and what is that", "100:06", "you know and in the the thing I'm being", "100:09", "taught is like that thing you're talking", "100:10", "about it can be cultivated and like", "100:13", "refined so you can sort of that's why", "100:17", "it's called a practice like when you're", "100:18", "sitting and you're watching your breath", "100:20", "and you're learning how to be in the", "100:21", "moment instead of thinking I'm doing", "100:25", "this for this reason or that like I'm", "100:27", "doing this because when I'm like talking", "100:29", "to somebody they're gonna think I'm", "100:31", "spiritual I'm doing this because I want", "100:32", "to be more focused I'm doing this", "100:33", "because I have an anxiety disorder I'm", "100:35", "doing this because of this or that", "100:36", "that's great but and there's another", "100:39", "reason to do it which is that if you get", "100:43", "really good at being in the moment with", "100:44", "people and also when you're sitting with", "100:47", "yourself and learning who you are you", "100:51", "have to start applying a lot of", "100:53", "compassion to yourself because you're", "100:55", "gonna sit man and you're gonna some", "100:57", "shits gonna float to the surface of the", "100:58", "stream that you wish it stayed under", "101:01", "some rocks man you're gonna see not just", "101:04", "shit that's been done to you but you're", "101:06", "gonna see shit that you've done to other", "101:08", "people and you're gonna have to deal", "101:10", "with that right and and the way to deal", "101:12", "with that is is not to do like I don't", "101:14", "know if you do this at all but sometimes", "101:16", "like I will remember something from when", "101:18", "I was very young and be like you fucking", "101:21", "a dick I'll say it out loud - nobody", "101:24", "yelling - someone like 15 years ago", "101:27", "right you're yelling at you at my past", "101:30", "self like you motherfucker you know what", "101:32", "have you got me into with my memories", "101:33", "Jesus Christ man why were you doing that", "101:36", "why did you do that", "101:37", "I'm like so that's like the opposite of", "101:40", "compassion for the self right so anyway", "101:43", "the point is if you can like sort of", "101:44", "cultivate compassion for who you are", "101:48", "right now that's not to say", "101:51", "use that as an excuse to not try to", "101:55", "become a kind of person but I'm saying", "101:57", "cultivate compassion for the fact that", "101:58", "like man your dad had PTSD and your", "102:04", "fucking folks got divorced when you were", "102:07", "three and your dad remarried an abusive", "102:12", "woman who hated your fucking guts for", "102:16", "seven fucking years and she did some", "102:19", "really bad things to you over the course", "102:21", "of that time that you were way too young", "102:23", "to cross the process or you hadn't know", "102:27", "you had no way to deal with that and now", "102:30", "when you're in your in your 20s or 30s", "102:32", "you realizing that you seem to be kind", "102:35", "of a selfish cunt and it's like well", "102:38", "yeah the reason you're being a selfish", "102:40", "quote cunt is because you had to build", "102:43", "up a very high-powered defense mechanism", "102:47", "to deal with the fact that you're abused", "102:49", "for almost a decade when your brain was", "102:51", "forming more neurons than it ever will", "102:53", "at any other point in its life and now", "102:56", "we can start having compassion for", "102:58", "ourselves instead of thinking I'm a", "102:59", "selfish cunt we could think oh I've got", "103:04", "too big a force field up I've developed", "103:07", "a thing to protect me from an", "103:10", "environment that I'm no longer in and", "103:12", "then the point is once you start", "103:15", "becoming compassionate for to yourself", "103:17", "that's when you run into the person", "103:19", "who's being a selfish cunt who you can", "103:23", "look at and say oh I see you I know who", "103:28", "you are I don't know what it was I don't", "103:32", "know if it was a abusive parent I don't", "103:34", "know if it was a heartbreak I don't know", "103:36", "if what's something

pretty much everyone who's normal", "103:58", "and not impaired mentally can learn how", "104:01", "to read yeah we agree this we agree to", "104:03", "this I think so yeah yeah we", "104:05", "agreed to simple mathematics everyone", "104:07", "can learn how to add and subtract and", "104:10", "yeah multiply and after that it gets a", "104:13", "little squirrely with division sure", "104:14", "people can't come but we're green that", "104:17", "with minimal paying attention in school", "104:19", "we can all achieve a certain level yes", "104:22", "but there's very little very little",

I'm saying is is the person who's", "131:50", "in the position of power is that thing", "131:53", "coming from inside of them or is it that", "131:55", "there's something like built in to the", "131:58", "DNA of a leadership position they say", "132:00", "that like in the same way like when you", "132:02", "got a pregnant wife some new thing kicks", "132:05", "in and I was reading about it

I'm saying", "132:29", "is if there seems to be a tendency that", "132:33", "happens when there is a convergence of", "132:37", "people in power right it starts behaving", "132:39", "in a certain way it builds walls it", "132:42", "starts taking people to jail you don't", "132:44", "belong in jail it dehumanizes", "132:47", "essentially that's the fucking tendency", "132:50", "right and so when you're taking a", "132:51", "psychedelic and you look around and you", "132:54", "realize oh I see the government though", "132:57", "it's filled with people who are", "132:59", "wonderful there are people in the", "133:01", "fucking DEA who listen to your show and", "133:03", "guaranteed loved the show and I'm like", "133:05", "you're fucking right man I don't want to", "133:07", "enforce these goddamn laws arresting", "133:09", "people for a thing that is like being", "133:11", "shown not only to be harmless but", "133:12", "potentially therapeutic there's people", "133:15", "in all

the", "133:29", "individual atomic structure of the power", "133:32", "structure I'm talking about the sum", "133:35", "total convergence the Gestalt of the", "133:38", "thing emanates certain

longshot I", "134:51", "don't fucking know but the main thing is", "134:54", "what I'm saying here is like I think", "134:56", "I've been aware of the fact that there", "134:59", "is something wonky going on and it's", "135:01", "walking in the most rotten brutal way", "135:04", "it's wonky in the sense that it kills", "135:07", "people", "135:07", "it separates children from families not", "135:10", "just of immigrants but of farmers some", "135:13", "people were growing marijuana and", "135:15", "guaranteed their kids are in foster care", "135:17", "now and they're in fucking jail right", "135:19", "this has been going on and on and on and", "135:22", "on I think maybe now it's great about", "135:24", "the fear that we're seeing in the hyper", "135:26", "reaction is if there is anything great", "135:29", "about it is that people are waking up to", "135:32", "the fact that our government right now", "135:35", "the American government is out of", "135:37", "balance we've been at war for 90% of our", "135:41", "history right and there's a lot of shit", "135:43", "going on in there that doesn't need to", "135:45", "be going on and we're waking up to it", "135:48", "it's just

fucking shit this is like you know", "135:57", "this happened", "135:58", "this sounds condescending I don't mean", "136:00", "it to be but when I was like like 18 or", "136:02", "17 looking at a
