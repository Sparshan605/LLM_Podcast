people", "146:10", "I can't believe that China is military", "146:12", "dictatorship in 2020 yeah and if you're", "146:15", "not careful that could happen here oh", "146:16", "absolutely I can happen anywhere if", "146:18", "you're lazy enough but it's here's we", "146:20", "have to understand this if it exists", "146:22", "anywhere it can exist here and we get", "146:24", "all complacent in this

all", "147:39", "those other possibilities like those", "147:41", "supervolcano like yeah we better destroy", "147:44", "it impacts we better re reintroduce the", "147:46", "pandemic Department and get those", "147:48", "fuckers their job back well we don't", "147:50", "even know if they really went away I", "147:51", "mean it is very accurate I'm a fuckin", "147:59", "moron you're a more", "148:00", "and we're all we're all more I love you", "148:03", "you're great moron I love you too", "148:05", "but this this is now we understand that", "148:09", "the way things have been is not", "148:11", "necessarily the way things always will", "148:13", "be and definitely not things can get a", "148:15", "whole lot weirder so we should be", "148:17", "fucking careful we should be careful but", "148:19", "we should also be grateful I think this", "148:20", "is a silver the silver lining hopefully", "148:22", "will be us learning how to prepare a", "148:26", "little bit more in in you know not argue", "148:30", "and debate over these stupid things that", "148:33", "don't fucking matter right but I think", "148:35", "the reason why we're going on and on", "148:37", "about stupid shit was because we didn't", "148:38", "have something like this because life", "148:40", "was too easy", "148:41", "yeah well shit it's never a good", "148:43", "complacency breeds contempt right
