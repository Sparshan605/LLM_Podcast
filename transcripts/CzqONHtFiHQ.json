"35:27", "watched one of your shows recently where", "35:30", "you're talking about I love this episode", "35:33", "where you're talking about are we living", "35:34", "in a simulation yes", "35:35", "so I was you know I love talking about", "35:39", "this stuff you know it doesn't mean that", "35:41", "I'm oh I think we're living in a", "35:42", "simulation oh I think that we you know", "35:44", "our doomsday is coming not necessarily", "35:46", "but I do love the thought experiment of", "35:48", "talking about it and thinking about it", "35:50", "and so after watching that show your", "35:52", "show I was really thinking about a lot", "35:53", "had a long conversation with my mom", "35:55", "about how you know we could be living in", "35:58", "a simulation you know what do you mean", "35:59", "well I mean you know", "36:00", "the computers are getting so fast I mean", "36:03", "they're gonna be able to program", "36:04", "computers that have conscious you know", "36:07", "that little character on a computer", "36:09", "might be able to start to think and then", "36:10", "its might start to be able to", "36:11", "self-determine and then we could just be", "36:13", "an advanced version of that and how", "36:15", "would we ever know and my mom's in there", "36:16", "and all what are you talking about and", "36:18", "then I had a pretty long day of talking", "36:21", "about this with my mom and trying to", "36:23", "convince her not that we're living a", "36:24", "simulation but that it's possible we", "36:26", "could be living in a simulation my", "36:27", "mother it wasn't really buying it right", "36:29", "and then two weeks later this happens", "36:31", "and I'm thinking it's like Fez were", "36:35", "living in a simulation because if you", "36:36", "were living in a simulation and then you", "36:38", "started talking about it mm-hmm and then", "36:40", "the creator of the simulation heard that", "36:43", "he might start a pandemic maybe a", "36:45", "problem is the term simulation yeah", "36:48", "because if you're living in a simulation", "36:51", "then it becomes your whole life mm-hmm", "36:53", "like is that simulated anymore like what", "36:55", "is that like maybe it's always been a", "36:58", "simulation mm-hm maybe if you stop and", "37:01", "think about events that take place that", "37:04", "ultimately all seem to be leading", "37:06", "towards events right when when you think", "37:09", "about the invention of electricity and", "37:11", "then the electronics of the 80s and the", "37:14", "90s that led to everyone having a home", "37:17", "computer that led to everybody having a", "37:18", "computer in your pocket it listens to", "37:20", "everything you say and takes pictures", "37:22", "and uploads video and just keeps getting", "37:24", "more and more advanced and more and more", "37:27", "intertwined with you being a person", "37:29", "until one day you enter it and you", "37:32", "become a part of it and it they create", "37:34", "something inside the world of computers", "37:37", "it's far more compelling than the", "37:39", "regular world itself but maybe that's", "37:41", "just the natural course of progression", "37:43", "and that's where life is going anyway", "37:44", "like maybe that's just a new kind of", "37:47", "life and", "37:48", "new dimension of life and that all these", "37:51", "things just come about through that they", "37:53", "come about through either natural causes", "37:55", "like you know star supernova and you", "37:59", "know everything coalesce --is and things", "38:00", "become carbon-based life forms emerge", "38:03", "and life becomes what it is in 2020 we", "38:07", "or those things figure out how to open", "38:11", "up new realities and that what a", "38:13", "simulation would be would just be", "38:15", "another reality mm-hmm that we were", "38:16", "created by some person doing the exact", "38:21", "same thing that we're doing right now", "38:22", "mm-hmm that one day we get to the point", "38:25", "where technology's so spectacularly", "38:27", "advanced that you could have a new world", "38:32", "that's indiscernible like you can't tell", "38:35", "that it's not real right it's impossible", "38:38", "to tell you are in that world now and", "38:39", "that's where you exist that's what I was", "38:42", "trying to convince my mother that we", "38:43", "might actually be in you Hoss she wasn't", "38:45", "buying it dude Ilana must thinks that", "38:47", "you must understand he freaks me out I", "38:49", "know I saw that on your show too if you", "38:53", "were talk to him no no I mean his eyes", "38:55", "like what's going on there man", "38:57", "oh yeah extra shits happening in there", "38:59", "yeah because when you got a guy that", "39:01", "intelligent and he's saying there's a 1%", "39:04", "chance or one and a billion chance that", "39:06", "we're not living in a simulation you", "39:07", "think okay so you just messing with me", "39:10", "or who was it was the gentleman's name", "39:14", "that I was having a discussion with ball", "39:16", "strim", "39:16", "bostr\u00f6m Nick Bostrom yeah yeah that's", "39:19", "socially that was watching that was a", "39:20", "very complicated discussion huh who's", "39:22", "talking about probability theory uh-huh", "39:24", "the probability of us having living life", "39:28", "inside of a simulation is usually higher", "39:29", "mm-hmm because ultimately we're going to", "39:31", "come up with a simulation someday and", "39:33", "then when you talk about this stuff", "39:34", "enough and when you watch your show", "39:37", "which I do and you listen to these", "39:39", "complex conversations right and you", "39:42", "start thinking about it and you start", "39:44", "thinking about all the possibilities", "39:45", "what could happen and then the this", "39:46", "pandemic happens and then you know yeah", "39:51", "yes I still live in the same place where", "39:53", "I did the show you know as I I started", "39:55", "seeing you know I'm here in Los Angeles", "39:57", "you saw him too all the sudden you seen", "39:58", "Black Hawk helicopters go on by", "40:01", "I'm seeing Apache helicopters going by", "40:04", "you're seeing the Ospreys you see the", "40:07", "Ospreys going by every day and the first", "40:10", "week of this and you're thinking what's", "40:12", "going on man do you watch The Walking", "40:13", "Dead you know I I haven't watched it let", "40:16", "me tell you I know it's crazy Walking", "40:17", "Dead the first many seasons where I hear", "40:19", "about it now the first few seasons were", "40:21", "awesome but maybe even better is the", "40:22", "first season of the LA version of The", "40:24",

"40:36", "did it very differently than the other", "40:37", "Walking Dead but you know it just like", "40:39", "where it people it takes a while for", "40:41", "people to realize what the fuck is", "40:42", "happening mm-hmm it sort of felt like is", "40:45", "that - yeah in the beginning in the", "40:46", "beginning oh yeah man in the beginning", "40:48", "it felt touch-and-go when everybody was", "40:50", "hoarding all the toilet paper and we're", "40:52", "fighting yo and everyone wants a gun the", "40:56", "gun lines were giant right the lines", "40:59", "outside the gun stores were creepy yeah", "41:01", "yeah were you in one of those lines", "41:06", "I'm not waiting in line I have a theory", "41:08", "about the toilet paper", "41:09", "maybe it's obvious but but I don't know", "41:13", "maybe it's not obvious I don't know so", "41:15", "toilet paper is big yes", "41:18", "so because it's big takes up a lot of", "41:20", "shelf space because it takes up a lot of", "41:21", "maybe everyone's talked about this", "41:22", "already but maybe takes up a lot of", "41:23", "shelf space so all of a sudden everybody", "41:26", "went to the grocery store at the same", "41:27", "time and there's probably far less", "41:29", "toilet paper than at the grocery store", "41:31", "then it would appear just because it", "41:34", "takes an entire aisle because it's big", "41:36", "so everybody what bought one piece of", "41:39", "packaged of toilet paper on the first", "41:41", "day it was instantly all gone it's", "41:44", "instantly an entire empty aisle which is", "41:47", "dramatic looking hmm and it was the", "41:49", "first sign of shelves being cleared and", "41:52", "it was the toilet paper was gone and", "41:54", "everyone went on their fucking phones", "41:55", "there's there's putting a running toilet", "41:57", "paper and all of a sudden that", "41:59", "compounded it exponentially and now", "42:01", "everyone's going for the toilet paper", "42:02", "and they don't need to be going for the", "42:03", "toilet paper and we had the great toilet", "42:06", "paper shortage of 2020 this is the type", "42:08", "of investigative reporting you do when", "42:10", "you're alone that makes a hundred", "42:18", "percent sense because it's big everyone", "42:20", "grabbed a can of corn everyone grab some", "42:22", "kind of beans but it didn't create an", "42:23", "entire empty aisle that then got people", "42:25", "thinking talking and and and tweeting", "42:27", "and typing and instagramming it's also", "42:29", "something dumb people think about a lot", "42:31", "of shitting yeah you don't want to not", "42:36", "be able to wipe your ass firfer all the", "42:39", "things you need like do you understand", "42:40", "what it's like when shit goes

need to worry about", "42:50", "is toilet paper you need to worry about", "42:52", "consuming food and staying alive yeah", "42:54", "some people don't think it's ever gonna", "42:56", "get to that and those are the ones that", "42:57", "stock up on toilet paper yeah the ones", "42:59", "you buy like rice and beans and stuff", "43:01", "like that those are the people that are", "43:03",

yes it's not", "43:21", "as available sometimes bioavailable as", "43:23", "it is in other foods yeah yeah", "43:25", "so he gets some protein you just got to", "43:28", "eat a lot yeah it's not as complete as", "43:31", "some forms of protein so have you been", "43:35", "enjoying doing the podcast since this", "43:38", "started obviously becomes a big subject", "43:41", "of conversation right do you do you", "43:44", "sometimes not want to talk about it", "43:46", "anymore I mean we could when your guests", "43:48", "come in is everyone always talking about", "43:50", "the pandemic and

about the same shit yeah but", "44:05", "that's it seems like as the more I think", "44:09", "about doing it the best way to do is", "44:11", "just talk to people just have talk just", "44:13", "talk just think about what you would how", "44:15", "would you normally talk yeah you'd have", "44:17", "to talk about this if I didn't see my", "44:19", "friend Tom green in a long time then all",

"that's awesome and he'd come up and I", "45:20", "was just so overjoyed that he was there", "45:22", "and we'd stand in the hallway and let's", "45:24", "start talking to him and he'd say I", "45:26", "could tell he'd get quiet was never", "45:28", "quiet on the show but he'd get quiet", "45:30", "before the show and I was like he's not", "45:33", "in a good mood and the first couple of",

"45:41", "and it made it a lot easier for me as", "45:43", "the host of the show in my living room", "45:47", "because then I didn't feel obligated to", "45:50", "talk to him either and we just sat there", "45:52", "in silence for half an hour until the", "45:54", "show starts we fucked that up a bunch of", "45:55", "times on this podcast not just you and I", "45:58", "I was trying to kind of talk about", "46:00", "things that weren't gonna come up I mean", "46:02", "like the early days of the podcast that", "46:04", "was before we ever all the chef's", "46:05", "started we had talked

I've", "46:38", "loved", "46:38", "doing what you you do I love doing this", "46:40", "I love talking to people I love creating", "46:43", "a you know whether it's an interview or", "46:46", "a conversation I love listening to", "46:49", "people and just waiting and feeling that", "46:51", "rhythm of it it's something that's very", "46:53", "interesting to me which took a long time", "46:55", "to figure out and that's what's kind of", "46:57", "exciting about you know doing this stuff", "47:00", "is you do learn as you do these shows", "47:02", "and where else would you ever have the", "47:03", "opportunity in the history of", "47:05", "broadcasting right to have built your", "47:08", "own studio and go oh I'm gonna do you", "47:10", "know what do you how many thousand shows", "47:12", "of you didn't know I'm gonna do a", "47:13", "thousand shows right I mean you've got", "47:15", "more you know time as a interviewer then", "47:20", "anyone like in history other than the", "47:23", "few handful of people that had shows", "47:25", "that didn't get cancelled right everyone", "47:27", "else they got a chance to do a talk show", "47:28", "they get to do it for a few weeks or a", "47:30", "few months or a few years and then it", "47:32", "get cancelled well it's radio guys have", "47:34", "been doing forever Eastern you need way", "47:36", "way way more yeah that's why I'm saying", "47:38", "you know you're in that category of", "47:40", "people where you've got 10,000 hours of", "47:42", "interviewing time you know mmm that's", "47:45", "pretty it pretty it's pretty awesome", "47:46", "it's pretty weird yeah it's not 10,000", "47:48", "hours yeah how many thousand hours a", "47:50", "thousand something 3,000 show 1,500 show", "47:54", "1500 shows and the longest ones are like", "47:56", "well there's a few five-hour ones in", "47:58", "there the Kevin Smith one a couple of", "48:00", "them that were like four or five hours", "48:01", "most of them are three or under yeah", "48:04", "yeah was it in the early days of it okay", "48:08", "when you were doing in your house how", "48:11", "long did you love it being in the house", "48:13", "and then at what point did it start to", "48:15", "be like haven't I don't want to do this", "48:16", "in my house anymore well when I was", "48:18", "bringing over of people that I didn't", "48:20", "know mhm then I was like just to see us", "48:22", "feels awkward you bring bring them to my", "48:24", "house it just feels like it also feels", "48:26", "like I was you know I wasn't the right", "48:31", "setup I wanted I was like well if I'm", "48:33", "doing this all the time I should have", "48:34", "like a better setup mhm I should figure", "48:36", "out I do this better so for a while red", "48:38", "bands set up at the Ice House we did it", "48:40", "there we just did a show together red", "48:42", "Ben and I we did weekend at San Diego at", "48:44", "the American comedy company right
