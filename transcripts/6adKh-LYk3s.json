problems on both sides we need", "01:32", "to not only", "01:34", "figure out why such things are happening", "01:36", "and prevent them", "01:38", "because that's not good nobody wants bad", "01:39",

about the", "02:08", "protests", "02:08", "he said um he said", "02:12", "saying they're mostly peaceful protests", "02:15", "is like saying", "02:15", "o.j simpson had a mostly peaceful day", "02:19", "when he killed nicole simpson because he", "02:20", "was only violent for a couple minutes", "02:22", "the rest of the day he was it was mostly", "02:24", "peaceful and he's like that's a good way", "02:27", "to describe", "02:28", "the protest i think you could also say", "02:30", "the same thing about the police", "02:31", "department the police department", "02:33", "and police officers are mostly good", "02:36", "people", "02:36", "doing a good job but the problem is when", "02:39", "one", "02:40", "out of all these millions of", "02:41", "interactions when one goes bad or", "02:43", "there's a bad", "02:44", "officer people see that they highlight", "02:47", "that", "02:47", "and then they say this is the cops these", "02:49", "are the cops i don't think that's true", "02:51", "i've met a lot of great police officers", "02:54", "i know a lot", "02:55", "and it's an insanely difficult job i", "02:59", "don't think they get paid enough i don't", "03:00",

perspective is very clear he's", "03:10", "like they do not train enough he goes if", "03:12", "i was in control they would be trained", "03:13", "20", "03:14", "of their time 20 of their week would be", "03:16", "spent in training", "03:17", "de-escalation drills safety drills how", "03:20", "to handle things if one", "03:21", "one of your partners is losing is cool", "03:23", "all sorts of", "03:25", "drills that they should be doing that", "03:26", "they do do in the navy seals that they", "03:28", "should be doing", "03:29", "in the police department as well yep i", "03:31", "listened to your uh your podcast with", "03:33", "jocko on it and i was", "03:35", "i was blown actually i listened to it", "03:36", "twice i listened to it the first time i", "03:38", "was like", "03:39", "yes yes yes yes yes i loved everything", "03:41", "that he had to say", "03:42", "he's a real leader he's so good he's so", "03:44", "good and and his idea about training", "03:46", "was i mean i'm in full agreement and", "03:49", "full the 20 training thing would be", "03:52", "would be", "03:52", "super hard especially now where we are", "03:55", "because money's going away not coming in", "03:56", "because that would mean", "03:58", "20 of the force would be off training", "04:01", "and we'd need that many more officers", "04:02", "and that many people on duty you know to", "04:04", "fill in the active", "04:05", "so you know while that would be a dream", "04:07", "and i think he's right", "04:08", "all those skills that you need if you're", "04:11", "not actively", "04:12", "you know if you're not actively training", "04:14", "and keeping them up to par they're going", "04:16", "to", "04:16", "they're going to go away you're going to", "04:17", "decay but on top of what he said", "04:20", "the piece where i was like yeah but let", "04:22", "me come in and talk with you too is", "04:24", "is that you know he thinks like the", "04:26", "warrior that he is you know navy seal", "04:28", "super tough guy talking about firearms", "04:29", "and he's right the firearms training is", "04:31", "probably not enough but what's even more", "04:33", "so especially in today's world and", "04:35", "society is that", "04:37", "when you look at the um the makeup of a", "04:39", "police academy training", "04:40", "you know first of all it's it's so short", "04:42", "and and they do they get", "04:44", "field training after that for a long", "04:45", "period of time and so that that's good", "04:47", "it balances it out", "04:48", "but the content of the academy you know", "04:50", "by far most of that time and training is", "04:52", "spent learning laws", "04:53", "learning that kind of textbook of what", "04:56", "it is to be a cop and how to function", "04:58", "and then the other parts there's the", "04:59", "physical training and the firearms", "05:01", "training", "05:02", "but if you look at what happens once a", "05:04", "police officer gets out there on the job", "05:05", "and what they're doing", "05:07", "a huge percentage of it is in", "05:09", "communicating", "05:10", "and there is almost none almost none", "05:14", "um you know the example i think of that", "05:16", "comes to mind", "05:17", "most when i prior to being at cal state", "05:19", "fullerton i was a", "05:21", "faculty member at john jay college of", "05:22", "criminal justice in new york", "05:24", "and so in the city we worked we did some", "05:27", "trainings with the nypd", "05:28", "we had a contract to do de-escalation", "05:30", "training so when their recruits were", "05:32", "coming through the academy they would", "05:33", "come over to john jay", "05:34", "and we would have police trainers and", "05:36", "and us the psychologists would come in", "05:38", "and we have these wonderful actors who", "05:40", "are trained to portray individuals with", "05:41", "mental illness", "05:42", "and we did this interactive", "05:44", "de-escalation training", "05:46", "teach them how to talk to somebody how", "05:47", "to what do you say", "05:49", "that's going to help bring someone down", "05:50", "as opposed to and it was this you know", "05:52", "okay ready here goes this training", "05:54", "scenario we pull these rookies up who", "05:56", "are scared to death give them like a", "05:57", "block gun", "05:58", "say okay go like wood block not a real", "06:00", "weapon", "06:01", "you know go to it and and engage this", "06:03", "individual and our actors are", "06:05", "were brilliant and and portray these uh", "06:07", "individuals with mental illness", "06:08", "wonderfully and", "06:10", "you know inevitably they'd come in hot", "06:11", "and things you know screaming erupts and", "06:14", "the the rookies going for their gun and", "06:15", "we're like okay okay okay", "06:17", "hold up stop let's talk about what just", "06:19", "happened from the psychology side we", "06:21", "kind of explained here's what's going on", "06:22", "here's why that didn't work", "06:23", "with this type of individual the police", "06:25", "tac you know would come in on the", "06:26", "tactics side and we'd say okay rewind", "06:29", "do over and then we would run them", "06:30", "through the scenario and we would keep", "06:32", "stopping and starting in this", "06:33", "interactive", "06:34", "like hands-on training by the end of the", "06:36", "day they were like i learned more today", "06:38", "than i learned in the last two months", "06:40", "yeah but we got them for one day right", "06:42", "six hours", "06:43", "and then that's it you know so that", "06:46", "whole", "06:47", "constant training in giving the skills", "06:49", "not just the firearms and the", "06:50", "tactics and the you know how to use", "06:52", "force properly but also", "06:54", "the communication and dealing with these", "06:57", "stressful situations and", "06:58", "and distressed individuals because that", "07:00", "is what they do", "07:02", "non-stop day in and day out yeah i", "07:05", "i know what you're saying when you were", "07:07", "talking about how difficult it would be", "07:10", "to actually have them trained 20", "07:13", "of the time right but i don't think it's", "07:15", "difficult enough that we should ignore", "07:17", "it i think that i think if", "07:18", "obviously i'm never going to be in", "07:19", "control but if i was in control i would", "07:21", "say", "07:21", "that's how it's got to be we have to", "07:23", "hire more people we need", "07:25", "i think they need way more people way", "07:27", "better training", "07:28", "and i think there also has to be", "07:30", "evaluations in terms of like", "07:32", "how are they dealing with stress because", "07:34", "it's not just", "07:36", "how to de-escalate how to deal with a", "07:38", "situation", "07:39", "with with a possible criminal", "07:43", "but also how are you dealing with the", "07:44", "fact that every time",

"08:08", "some soldiers can see some crazy shit", "08:10", "and be like it's okay i'm good to go", "08:12", "and then other soldiers like i'm fucked", "08:14", "up i don't know what to do here i", "08:16", "have anxiety i can't sleep i'm a nervous", "08:19", "wreck", "08:20", "same thing is true for for cops some", "08:22", "folks", "08:23", "are they can go through you know have", "08:25",

"react and it's awful", "08:36", "but they recover and and and they're", "08:38", "okay the next day", "08:39", "and then you know on the opposite hand", "08:41", "you've got somebody who has", "08:42", "maybe a less intense or you know a less", "08:44", "horrific call", "08:45", "and it just puts them over the edge and", "08:48", "you know from the psychology side you", "08:49", "know we've studied this we've looked at", "08:51", "this what it", "08:51", "how can we tell is there a way we can", "08:53", "predict you know what type of event what", "08:55", "type of person who", "08:56",

syndrome later and", "09:07", "and", "09:07", "the shorter answers we can't there are", "09:09", "some things that that we know", "09:11", "and obviously you know some of them are", "09:13", "really logical if you're in a higher", "09:14", "state of stress if you've already got", "09:15", "vulnerabilities going in you're", "09:17", "you know going through a divorce at home", "09:19", "and unhappy

in front of that you", "09:28", "know it's not", "09:29", "surprising that that maybe that would", "09:31", "push somebody over the edge into a", "09:32", "really troubling place but other times", "09:35", "you know it's really hard thing to", "09:37", "predict and so instead we need to", "09:40", "be there and be on it and there i mean", "09:42", "there's so many things that can add in", "09:43", "about", "09:44", "you know how we do that and in ways that", "09:46", "we're really falling", "09:47", "short which is kind of my my passion and", "09:50", "where i am these days", "09:52",

a standard", "10:02", "procedure", "10:03", "when someone comes back from say", "10:05", "witnessing a murder", "10:07", "is there a standard way that they", "10:09", "interact with them across",

depending on", "10:19", "the department", "10:20", "and what they put in place so when it", "10:22", "comes to like the", "10:23", "mental health and psychology the the", "10:25", "things that we do with departments are", "10:27", "it's it's very standard these days like", "10:30", "i think the numbers show about 80", "10:32", "90 sorry 98 of departments do a", "10:35", "pre-employment", "10:36", "uh psychological evaluation before", "10:38", "they're hired that's what i spend the", "10:40", "majority of my time doing is screening", "10:42", "people who are starting the job so that", "10:44",

depends on the department", "10:55", "some departments require a", "10:57", "what we would call a you know a critical", "10:58", "incident debriefing", "11:00", "um so some of the agencies that i work", "11:02", "with will if if somebody is involved or", "11:04", "there's a major incident", "11:06", "every officer who is on scene there will", "11:08", "come in and do a debriefing", "11:10", "with me or with another psychologist to", "11:12", "check in afterwards", "11:14", "and a lot of that is just where are they", "11:16", "how are they in this", "11:17", "in this moment are they okay

say most of the time it feels", "11:31", "pretty clear-cut", "11:32", "most of the time folks are either", "11:35", "they're doing all right", "11:36", "they're a little shaken up which is", "11:38", "normal i mean anybody who experiences", "11:39", "something life-threatening is going to", "11:41", "be", "11:42", "off off at that point so a lot of what", "11:44", "we do in those", "11:45", "in those debriefings is education i have", "11:48", "these little handouts that i give", "11:49", "to all the officers that go through and", "11:51", "say this is what you are likely feeling", "11:52", "right now", "11:53", "this is what you're likely to feel in", "11:54", "the next couple days and anything kind", "11:57", "of goes", "11:57", "you know we say in those first few days", "11:59", "whatever you're feeling is is", "12:00", "is probably okay but then over the", "12:03", "course of the first week we expect", "12:05", "people to settle in and to start", "12:07", "recovering", "12:07", "and if you're not then we want to start", "12:09", "paying attention to the ways are you", "12:11", "still not sleeping", "12:12", "are you having nightmares are you having", "12:13", "flash you know what's going on", "12:15", "and you know again varies by department", "12:18", "some of them", "12:19", "will then also offer up to four sessions", "12:22", "to come back and continue meeting", "12:24", "to see them through that kind of early", "12:27", "adjustment", "12:27", "phase and then if they're still", "12:30", "struggling at the point at the end then", "12:32", "we can refer them to longer term for", "12:34", "treatment", "12:35", "um and if everything looks fine then we", "12:36", "say okay you know resume", "12:38", "duty or clear to go back so that that", "12:41", "initial meeting afterwards is mandatory", "12:43", "at least for the departments that", "12:45", "choose to do it that's a mandatory", "12:47", "couple sessions afterwards", "12:48", "are not they're they're if needed and", "12:51", "then from there we kind of set the path", "12:53", "like all good", "12:54", "clear or let's carry on and keep you", "12:56", "know keep working with you until you can", "12:58", "recover", "12:59", "do you support this idea that it should", "13:01", "be controlled", "13:03", "locally by each individual police", "13:05", "department or do you think there should", "13:06", "be a nationwide mandate like some sort", "13:08", "of a", "13:09", "a standard operational procedure where", "13:11", "they", "13:12", "they treat everyone the same way train", "13:14", "everyone the same way", "13:16", "deal with every single murder suicide", "13:20", "child death and they have like a", "13:22", "protocol that they follow", "13:23", "so it's just standard across the country", "13:27", "based on science i i do i think", "13:30", "many of these things these fundamental", "13:32", "pieces", "13:33", "should be mandatory i think", "13:35", "pre-employment psychological evaluation", "13:37", "is an", "13:37", "absolute must and and again most", "13:39", "agencies do that piece", "13:41", "i think the critical incident", "13:42",

see the shrink they", "13:50", "see you coming and they're like", "13:52", "i'm out of here like no keep the shrink", "13:54", "away but they're probably trying to deal", "13:56", "with it their own way", "13:57", "yep and then somebody that they don't", "13:59", "even know who comes in and starts", "14:01", "probing and asking questions and they", "14:03", "see some guy in a suit", "14:04", "maybe he's never even seen a dead body", "14:07", "and you're like hey shut the fuck up man", "14:08", "i know what i'm doing let me just go", "14:10", "back out there and go to work", "14:11", "and the other things that feed into that", "14:13", "are i mean obviously we know law", "14:14", "enforcement just like military the", "14:16", "culture is very", "14:17", "yeah i am in control right i got this i", "14:20", "don't need your help i am tough i am you", "14:22", "know", "14:22", "and supported by each other and we are", "14:24", "each other right", "14:26", "and so that that culture doesn't make it", "14:29", "inviting to come and talk to a you know", "14:30", "a shrink or an outside person", "14:32", "um you know and and the other part is", "14:36", "that officers are really fearful of", "14:37", "losing their jobs right", "14:39", "you know having their livelihood taken", "14:40", "away that's a huge", "14:42", "deal and depending on the psychologist", "14:45", "if they're seeing somebody who is not", "14:47", "familiar with law enforcement culture", "14:49", "or who is you know real quick to judge", "14:52", "and to jump on the no", "14:53", "no we can't have this person out there", "14:54", "with a badge and a gun sure you know", "14:56", "there's a really delicate line there", "14:58", "you obviously don't want somebody who's", "14:59", "unstable to be

shooter", "20:25", "they're likely to be on an admin leave", "20:26", "anyway while everything's being reviewed", "20:28", "because the agency side you know the", "20:30", "investigations and all the", "20:32", "procedures and and checks are going on", "20:34", "so they're probably not going back out", "20:35", "to the street right away anyway while", "20:37", "all of that stuff gets cleared",

biggest problems out", "21:59", "there i feel like we do an okay job", "22:01", "having these", "22:01", "debriefings right afterwards because we", "22:03", "can monitor we check back in", "22:04",

"22:12", "educate them and say hey", "22:13", "here are you know i give them those", "22:15", "fliers and say look here's what we know", "22:17", "here's some good things to do here's", "22:18", "some bad things to do here's what it", "22:20", "might feel like", "22:21", "if any of these things are off here's my", "22:23", "information call me", "22:25", "and come back in is it a real problem", "22:27", "with cops just not wanting to help", "22:29", "because they're because they're you know", "22:31", "the fear", "22:32", "the the fear also and they're tough guys", "22:35", "a lot of them", "22:36", "tough girls they're like i got it they", "22:38", "yes", "22:39", "i've got this i mean the whole job is", "22:41", "about being in control", "22:42", "yeah every scene you roll up on you are", "22:44", "in control", "22:45", "that command presence is necessary to be", "22:48", "an officer and so", "22:50", "to not be in control it just feels", "22:53", "terrible", "22:54", "um and i mean for anybody for any human", "22:56", "it's hard to make the call to a", "22:58", "therapist and say i need a little help", "23:00", "right anybody who's made who's thought", "23:02", "you know what i'm not doing so well", "23:03", "right now i really feel like i could use", "23:05", "picking up that phone and calling to", "23:07", "seek help is a big deal so", "23:09", "for a police officer yeah there's a", "23:10", "stigma there's a do i really need this", "23:12", "it just is hard to pick up and", "23:15", "you don't want to be the person that", "23:16", "wants help all the time like hey figured", "23:18", "out yourself", "23:19", "and can this person really help me who's", "23:21", "this going to be how do i find that", "23:22", "there's", "23:23", "a lot of facts the most frequent", "23:24", "question i get from my friends and", "23:26", "family and people", "23:27", "i'm thinking i might need to see someone", "23:28", "like how do i go about doing that", "23:30", "um get the question all the time so yeah", "23:33", "for cops it's even bigger because that", "23:34", "whole control thing", "23:36", "yeah and also like i said before their", "23:38", "job is on the line", "23:39", "of course so for these cops that are", "23:42", "in that situation so when they say look", "23:45", "i need to take some time off", "23:46", "you you basically just leave them alone", "23:49", "and say if you", "23:50", "want these resources here they are or", "23:52", "did they", "23:53", "i mean is what again it's going to vary", "23:56", "by department", "23:57", "that's not kind of crazy that it does", "23:58", "vary by department yeah it drives me", "24:00", "nuts", "24:01", "and is has this discussion been had like", "24:04", "nationwide", "24:05", "oh there's there's so many good things", "24:08", "and pieces of advice and recommendation", "24:10", "out there", "24:10", "one of the things that's kind of painful", "24:13", "right now", "24:14", "is you know every morning i get a news", "24:17", "recap from the", "24:18", "international association of chiefs of", "24:20", "police they send this email out to all", "24:22", "the all the members of there and they", "24:24", "have the psychological services group", "24:25", "and so you get these updates and i i", "24:27", "usually just kind of pass them over but", "24:29", "lately with all the police reform", "24:31", "so it's just headlines from around the", "24:32", "country and the piecemeal", "24:35", "randomness of of this city is doing this", "24:38", "and this city is doing this and this", "24:40", "city is doing this and this", "24:41", "and it's all over the place you know", "24:42", "same that's driving me nuts because i'm", "24:44", "like there's already been groups that", "24:47", "have studied and reported and told us", "24:48", "what we need to do", "24:50", "to help the the world of policing", "24:53", "rise up and do better we've that", "24:55", "information's out there from", "24:56", "from wonderful brilliant people who've", "24:58", "come together and have laid it out for", "25:00", "us", "25:01", "it's there but yet we we don't have that", "25:05", "national standard each state has certain", "25:08", "you know most states have a group like", "25:12", "in california it's the california post", "25:14", "you know it's the police officer", "25:16", "standards and training so they set all", "25:18", "the rules", "25:19", "for training minimal training", "25:22", "requirements", "25:22", "for all the departments in california so", "25:25", "all the agencies police agencies here in", "25:27", "this state", "25:28", "are you know need to comply with all the", "25:30", "post recommendations but they're all you", "25:32", "know it's a minimum standard and our", "25:33", "post california post is kind of", "25:35", "heads and tails ahead of most of the", "25:37", "country some", "25:38", "some states don't actually have that", "25:40", "organization most do", "25:42", "have something similar to like what we", "25:43", "have so they do set some standards", "25:46", "but there's so many things that are not", "25:49", "included in that", "25:50", "um and so it is a bit you know random", "25:54", "it's hard i think to make a", "25:56", "one-size-fits-all", "25:57", "everybody must do this because if you", "25:59", "think about it i think there's about 18", "26:02", "000 different police agencies in the u.s", "26:05", "and i think i read about 50 of those", "26:08", "have 10 or fewer full-time officers", "26:10", "so you know when you've got po dunk tiny", "26:13", "little town in the middle of you know", "26:16", "the midwest in a very rural county that", "26:18", "that's you know", "26:19", "that's a whole lot different than lapd", "26:21", "right so", "26:22", "it's it's hard to have everybody on the", "26:25", "same standard and the same expectations", "26:26", "when we've got a lot of different", "26:28", "makeups for a lot of different", "26:29", "departments", "26:30", "that said there are some fundamentals", "26:33", "that i think", "26:34", "every department should be held to um", "26:37", "and and", "26:38", "one of those is the debriefings after an", "26:40", "incident and", "26:41", "the one that that almost no one is doing", "26:44", "that's been talked about for a while", "26:45", "is regular mental wellness checks you", "26:48", "know at this point", "26:49", "you get a psyche vowel when you're hired", "26:51", "or before you're hired", "26:53", "and if you're in a critical incident you", "26:55", "may or may not get one", "26:57", "more more are starting to do that and", "27:00", "then the only other time you're going to", "27:01", "be required to see the psychologist is", "27:03", "if you have messed up", "27:04", "and you're in trouble and you're", "27:06", "referred for a fitness for duty", "27:07", "evaluation", "27:08", "and at that point your job is on the", "27:10", "line someone is saying that", "27:11", "they think you're not fit for duty and", "27:14", "that is a scary evaluation to have to be", "27:16", "a part of because then you're going in", "27:18", "and", "27:20", "yeah if the psychologist judges and", "27:22", "decides that you are not able to go back", "27:24", "out", "27:25", "well then you're then you're off duty", "27:27", "until you can fix whatever that problem", "27:28", "may be", "27:29", "right well also just for the public's", "27:32", "health and", "27:33", "welfare it's important to do that sure i", "27:35", "mean there clearly are a lot of police", "27:36", "officers that are unfit for duty", "27:39", "how how do we stop", "27:42", "what happened in minneapolis how do we", "27:45", "stop that from", "27:46", "from happening or at least mitigate it", "27:49", "so i mean again i i see everything", "27:52", "through my lens as a psychologist as a", "27:53", "police psychologist so", "27:55", "i'm sure there are things beyond my", "27:57", "realm that that also answer this", "27:59", "question but for me the things that i", "28:00", "think we could be doing different that", "28:02", "would really make a difference", "28:03", "are the regular", "28:07", "annual mental wellness checks if", "28:10", "from my perspective when i look at", "28:12", "people like you know", "28:14", "derek chauvin the the officer that that", "28:16", "murdered george floyd", "28:17", "and we see what happened there he", "28:20", "i would say i would be willing to guess", "28:22", "and i don't know him i've never met him", "28:24", "i don't know", "28:25", "much about his career other than what", "28:26", "i've read in the news and and whatnot", "28:29", "police officers that get to that place", "28:32", "become that", "28:33", "right they're not that when they're", "28:34", "hired right to get hired as a cop", "28:36", "you have to go through what often takes", "28:39", "a year-long", "28:40", "application process where they are", "28:41", "digging and poking into every aspect of", "28:43", "your background", "28:44", "let's be clear though that's in some", "28:46", "places in other places it's pretty easy", "28:49", "again smaller departments that don't", "28:51", "have the resources probably probably so", "28:53", "yeah i shouldn't say pretty easy in", "28:56", "comparison in comparison yeah", "28:58", "but the vast majority of departments", "29:00", "have a pretty you know", "29:01", "have a similar process in that you're", "29:03", "going to go through the application you", "29:04", "have to pass a written test", "29:06", "there's going to be a a background", "29:08", "investigation which", "29:09", "really i think is a hugely powerful key", "29:12", "part", "29:13", "it that it should be a well-done",

wide variety of people", "29:29", "that i see that have", "29:30", "passed their backgrounds some agencies i", "29:32", "work for send me the most amazingly", "29:34", "clean candidates and others", "29:36", "that are trying to hire a lot and a", "29:39", "squeaky clean but they've they've all", "29:40", "gone through", "29:41", "and it has you know gone through this", "29:42", "background they also do a polygraph", "29:45", "they do social media checks they you", "29:47", "know they make you list all your tattoos", "29:49", "and", "29:50", "you know so they're they're looking for", "29:52",

that somewhere", "30:02", "in that digging around", "30:03", "so the the blatant racist folks", "30:06", "are likely weeded out during a good", "30:09", "background process", "30:10", "let's say maybe they're not as openly", "30:12", "because you know we all know that people", "30:14", "know better than to admit to such things", "30:17", "most of the time these days and it could", "30:18", "be more subtle", "30:19", "so at that point what comes next you've", "30:21", "got oral interviews with you know police", "30:23", "administrators", "30:25", "um a polygraph you know coming along in", "30:27", "there and once they pass all of that", "30:29", "that's when they come to the last they", "30:30", "get their conditional offer of", "30:32", "employment", "30:32", "so they're basically like as long as you", "30:34", "get through these last two steps you're", "30:36", "you're good to go for the academy and", "30:37", "the last two steps are the medical", "30:39", "evaluation and the

"30:50", "and we get a we get a pretty clean group", "30:52", "of people", "30:53", "but then we get to do more digging and", "30:55", "we get to ask questions at this point", "30:56", "that they're not able to ask before", "30:58", "so about mental health and background", "31:00", "and psychological treatment and history", "31:02", "and so you know by the and then if they", "31:05", "get through these evaluations", "31:07", "then they go on to the academy so for us", "31:09", "that vetting process that psych eval is", "31:11", "a really important", "31:12", "place and i've had a lot of",

other", "31:22", "police psychologists on", "31:24", "you know some of the things we do in", "31:25", "these pre-employments and had someone", "31:27", "say", "31:28", "how do we screen out the cops who kill", "31:30", "and i said", "31:32", "we can't and that was not a good answer", "31:35", "that we can't", "31:36", "we we can't because we have to what", "31:38", "we're doing here is predicting the", "31:40", "future", "31:40", "right we're saying how do we know who's", "31:43", "going to be", "31:44", "that person who does that later", "31:46", "predicting the future is incredibly hard",

um and so much more to", "32:25", "say about the tests and the screening", "32:27", "but", "32:27", "gets really nerdy and detailed i would", "32:30", "say", "32:30", "that the officers who end up

know how do we", "34:06", "prevent these", "34:07", "these issues is we need to look at the", "34:10", "individual", "34:10", "officer level but we need to look at the", "34:13", "culture i think that is very limited", "34:15", "because i think", "34:16", "the racist angry cop who kills has", "34:19", "developed that way over time", "34:20", "and i think one of the pieces is the", "34:22", "culture in the department is this", "34:23", "something that's acceptable", "34:25", "is there corruption in that department", "34:26", "and so certainly better oversight and", "34:28", "tracking is a really important thing", "34:31", "um you know that should happen but the", "34:33", "other piece and the one that", "34:35", "that i focus more on for my end is the", "34:37", "wellness you know", "34:38", "is this somebody who is burning out is", "34:40", "this somebody who has", "34:41", "gone into a dangerous place you know", "34:44", "psychologically that they started out", "34:46", "and they were fine when we screened them", "34:48", "up front but you know over five or 10 or", "34:50", "15 years they've seen so much", "34:52", "and you know there's some one there", "34:55", "things happen",

i'm not the", "35:39", "first one to come up with this", "35:40", "idea it's been suggested by task forces", "35:43", "and study groups and people who know a", "35:44", "whole lot more than i do for",

to pay", "36:07", "attention to officer wellness", "36:09", "one of which was we seem to think that", "36:11", "some regular checkups will probably help", "36:12", "but", "36:13", "the problem is no one's doing them and", "36:15", "we have literally zero research on", "36:17", "you know what what are they helpful can", "36:20", "they prevent this", "36:21", "and i believe they are so my", "36:24", "you know my next big thing is to go and", "36:26", "explore and and do that research so that", "36:28", "we can show", "36:30", "hey this does help we can we can if", "36:32", "we're touching base and we're getting", "36:33", "people", "36:34", "in then we can catch the problems as", "36:37", "they develop", "36:38", "and before they become a major problem", "36:40", "where

problems before they um you", "36:50", "know before they become", "36:52", "behaviors that are problematic there", "36:53", "seems to be a lot of discussion now", "36:56", "about police brutality but there's not a", "36:59", "lot of discussion", "37:00", "about the psychological troubles", "37:03", "and the the really the difficult path of", "37:06", "being a police officer", "37:08", "and appreciation for the people that", "37:10", "have to do that job", "37:12", "um all this defunding the police talk", "37:15", "scares the shit out of me", "37:16", "because uh i see what's going on right", "37:18", "now in new york city", "37:20", "and it's a goddamn shooting gallery it's", "37:23", "crazy", "37:23", "and the reason why is because the police", "37:26", "officers have", "37:27", "no trust in the mayor they want to quit", "37:30", "they don't feel like they get any", "37:31", "respect they feel like they", "37:33", "they have all been lumped in with this", "37:35", "one murderous cop from", "37:37", "minneapolis now they're all bad cops and", "37:40", "there's a license to call them bad cops", "37:42", "scream terrible things at them when", "37:44", "they've done nothing wrong and they're", "37:45", "just there to protect and serve a lot of", "37:47", "them", "37:48", "are good people the the vast majority so", "37:50", "when you're seeing this giant", "37:52", "uptick in murders in new york city city", "37:55", "and giant uptick in shootings", "37:56", "and then you still have that dipshit of", "37:58", "a mayor calling for the defunding of the", "38:00", "police like", "38:01", "my god like what i i know so much of the", "38:05", "things they say", "38:06", "are just political because they just", "38:07", "want to appeal to their base and there's", "38:09", "so many people out there", "38:10", "that have this very narrow minded", "38:13", "perspective they just have blinders on", "38:16", "and their id it's like racial justice", "38:18", "social justice defund the police this is", "38:20", "like this mantra that they have to say", "38:21", "with no depth to it they don't", "38:23", "understand the consequences of saying", "38:25", "such a thing", "38:26", "or implementing such a thing now we're", "38:28", "seeing", "38:30", "a call for police action because there's", "38:33", "a lot of people there's a lot of", "38:34", "community groups a lot of people", "38:35", "that are community leaders that are in", "38:37", "these communities that are", "38:39", "just experiencing unprecedented gun", "38:42", "violence and crime and", "38:44", "now they're saying we got to do", "38:45", "something about this so they're trying", "38:47", "to reinstate some of these policies", "38:49", "that they had pulled before i'm hoping", "38:52", "that through this what we had talked", "38:54", "about with training", "38:55", "and with funding the police more", "38:59", "instead of defunding the police train", "39:01", "them better fund them more", "39:03", "we you obviously need police this idea", "39:05", "that you don't need police or", "39:07", "criminals just going to go away like is", "39:09", "crime going to go away", "39:10", "we have a problem we have an enormous", "39:13", "number of people", "39:14", "and out of that enormous number of", "39:16", "people there is a certain percentage of", "39:18", "them that will victimize other people", "39:20", "they will steal they will kill and if", "39:22", "they don't get", "39:23", "caught then you develop a culture of", "39:25", "crime", "39:26", "and then you develop a thing where you", "39:29", "you", "39:29", "you you basically have what's going on", "39:31", "in mexico where the cartels", "39:33", "have more power than the police which is", "39:36", "a terrible situation", "39:37", "if you have that in individual locations", "39:39", "like in new york city", "39:40", "if all of a sudden this criminal gangs", "39:43", "these these criminal gangs", "39:44", "develop more gun power more more support", "39:47", "of the community", "39:48", "they have more people than police", "39:50", "officers", "39:51", "you've got a giant problem and the the", "39:54", "actual peaceful citizens are the ones", "39:56", "that are going to be in trouble", "39:57", "and all those people that are out there", "39:58", "protesting that think they're", "40:00", "immune from it because they're the ones", "40:01", "saying defund the police hey man", "40:03", "they'll fucking rob you too they'll", "40:05", "shoot you too like you don't understand", "40:07", "humans and you don't understand violence", "40:09", "and so this utopian world that they're", "40:11", "trying to push like defund the police", "40:12", "we're just gonna", "40:13", "we're gonna refund we're gonna put that", "40:15", "money into the community and", "40:16", "everything's gonna be fine", "40:17", "and it's not gonna be fine you need to", "40:19", "fund the police more", "40:20", "you need to train the police better we", "40:22", "need more oversight", "40:24", "and we need to recognize that this is a", "40:26", "time where everybody's got to come", "40:27", "together on this", "40:28", "and we got to figure out what's wrong", "40:30", "fix what's wrong recognize that there's", "40:32", "some problems but", "40:33", "you can't blame all cops and you can't", "40:35", "say defund the police because that's", "40:36", "nonsense that this that is a a silly", "40:41", "like a version of life that doesn't it's", "40:43", "not real", "40:44", "yeah you need good cops better cops are", "40:47", "you saying we need to get rid of bad", "40:48", "cops", "40:49", "yes definitely i think everybody agrees", "40:51", "with that how do you do that", "40:53", "that's where the question starts and", "40:55", "training them more", "40:57", "like this idea that you can't spend 20", "40:58", "percent of the time training them", "41:00", "well if you did spend 20 percent of the", "41:02", "time training them and there was a lot", "41:03", "less crime because of it and the", "41:05", "interactions with", "41:06", "with people were much better wouldn't", "41:08", "that just be overall better is that an", "41:10", "impossible task", "41:11", "i mean how much money goes into the", "41:13", "police department you tell me you can't", "41:15", "add 20", "41:16", "to that and train them more i bet you", "41:19", "can", "41:20", "and i bet you could find it financially", "41:22", "beneficial", "41:23", "i would see overall if you could reduce", "41:25", "crime that way", "41:26", "and reduce the animosity between", "41:29", "citizens and the police", "41:30", "wouldn't that be better for everybody it", "41:33", "would", "41:34", "and i agree i agree with with you i mean", "41:37", "on the defunding thing you know i think", "41:39", "and you've had other people say this too", "41:40", "and", "41:41", "you know this i'm not saying anything", "41:43", "really amazing here that like", "41:45", "it means different things to different", "41:46", "people and i wholeheartedly agree the", "41:48", "folks who think defunding means like", "41:49", "just get rid of them", "41:51", "like that that that's silly what's your", "41:53", "plan b what", "41:54", "do you do i don't think they really mean", "41:56", "that i don't yeah i don't understand", "41:58", "what happens next and i haven't heard", "42:00", "anybody articulate so then what and", "42:02", "again there is no then not", "42:03", "that's why no one has a then what those", "42:05", "are the the emails i get that talk the", "42:07", "headlines i saw one", "42:08", "yesterday or the day before that in", "42:10", "minneapolis now there are groups of", "42:11", "citizens banding together", "42:13", "armed citizens banding together to", "42:15", "patrol the streets for crime and i", "42:16", "thought oh my god", "42:17", "exactly oh boy that's a shit show", "42:20", "waiting to happen", "42:22", "community members shooting people and", "42:24", "then their church they're charged with", "42:25", "murder", "42:26", "it's a just a horrific thought and i", "42:28", "can't quite imagine like that", "42:30", "so i i completely understand", "42:34", "the the anger and the frustration", "42:35", "because you're right we don't need bad", "42:37", "cops there's nothing worse than", "42:39", "you know the person you call to protect", "42:40", "you and to help you when you're in", "42:42", "an emergency doing the wrong thing and", "42:44", "and doing harm", "42:45", "you know that we don't need or want that", "42:48", "and i wholeheartedly agree that more", "42:50", "training", "42:51", "and and the right type of training and", "42:53", "and spending that time because i also", "42:55", "think that the training gives you", "42:57", "access to see where people are and if", "42:59", "they're on a good path or if they are", "43:00", "that problematic person", "43:02", "you see what kind of character they have", "43:04", "too if you test them during this", "43:05", "training so if we're still", "43:06", "if we're seeing them on a regular basis", "43:08", "and pulling them out and giving them the", "43:10", "tools that they need then", "43:12", "then absolutely i think that is an", "43:14", "exceptional thing", "43:15", "to do that was part of what your your", "43:17", "podcast with jocko just", "43:18", "blew me away with you know the way he", "43:20", "talked about you know and the other", "43:22", "thing that that sort of has gotten lost", "43:24", "is this whole idea of you know the", "43:26", "interaction with the community with", "43:28", "community oriented policing", "43:30", "um you know and it's it's exactly what", "43:32", "jocko was talking about when he was", "43:33", "talking about being overseas and i think", "43:35", "he was talking about petraeus and the", "43:36", "order of you know you don't just roll up", "43:38", "in your tank", "43:39", "and cruise through you stop and you talk", "43:42", "and you humanize yourself", "43:43", "and you engage with these you know with", "43:45", "the folks here", "43:47", "and you let them know that you're you're", "43:49", "here to protect and to serve and you", "43:50", "connect with them", "43:51", "and that helps both the community", "43:53", "citizens and the soldiers", "43:55", "that's the same thing that we're wanting", "43:57", "here at home", "43:58", "in this country that that your police", "44:01", "are supposed to be", "44:02",

not a new idea right it's been", "44:12", "around for decades", "44:13", "but we somehow still don't have that", "44:16", "going on now", "44:17", "it's still well what seems like", "44:19", "everything in society is now it's us", "44:21", "versus", "44:22", "them you know it's the police versus the", "44:23", "community instead of", "44:25", "we are a community together and we need",

shoot handguns and", "44:48", "the guy who teaches me was telling me", "44:51", "you would be", "44:52", "stunned at how inept some of these cops", "44:56", "are to come here", "44:57", "he goes they

annual you", "46:37", "know service that you", "46:38", "in service training you've got to go", "46:40", "through and do and", "46:42", "so if we're still seeing that people who", "46:44", "are out of shape", "46:45", "yet they've passed a physical fitness", "46:46", "test and who can't shoot but if", "46:48", "imagine their mental health imagine what", "46:50", "that looks like", "46:51", "and

that", "49:02", "entirely dependent upon what where", "49:03", "you're at and what what kind of", "49:05", "situation i mean", "49:06", "all across the country there are", "49:07", "situations where

there", "52:08", "are spurts of that", "52:10", "but you know a lot of that 12-hour shift", "52:13", "is", "52:13", "sitting and waiting or patrolling", "52:15", "depending on what you're you know

just enough", "55:42", "and i i mean i i agree i", "55:45", "i found it especially in those early", "55:47", "weeks very stressful to be somebody who", "55:50", "really", "55:51", "loves and supports

doing out there", "56:20", "i mean we've got to find a way to not do", "56:23", "the us versus them", "56:24", "and and to meet both good cops", "56:27", "anti-racism", "56:28", "those those are

the the backlash it's", "67:59", "definitely the", "68:00", "uh one of the hardest aspects of the job", "68:04", "is that", "68:04", "you know you're given an immense amount", "68:08", "of power", "68:09", "um you know that badge and that gun just", "68:12", "are are tremendous in terms of what they", "68:15", "give you liberty to do", "68:17", "and like all humans you know power power",

see in these", "68:38", "videos started out as bad people", "68:41", "right i don't think they said i mean i", "68:44", "spend", "68:45", "so many days of my life evaluating these", "68:47", "folks who want to go into this very", "68:48", "noble profession", "68:50", "and the majority of them are just really", "68:53", "great people", "68:54", "occasionally you get an idiot that comes", "68:56",

because less people want to", "69:05", "be police", "69:06", "well so it's going to be even worse", "69:07", "doubly scaring now the defunding thing", "69:09", "obviously is", "69:10", "is a huge issue like what's going to", "69:12", "happen agencies are not going to be able", "69:14", "to hire because the money's being taken", "69:15", "away", "69:16", "it's a political thing as well when they", "69:18", "say we're going to defund the police all", "69:20", "the progressive people go", "69:21", "yes i want to be unsafe yes", "69:25", "but that the combination of the", "69:28", "defunding as well as the tanking economy", "69:31", "um", "69:31", "you know some of the departments that i", "69:33", "work for you know they're the the money", "69:35", "that comes into that city", "69:36", "or that town to support the department", "69:38", "you know that", "69:39", "we're all at the financial crisis that's", "69:41", "going on from the pandemic", "69:43", "you know so i've a few of the agencies", "69:45", "that i work for are like yeah we don't", "69:47", "anticipate hiring in maybe the next two", "69:48", "to three years", "69:51", "so and that's partly you know and in", "69:53", "some it's not a defunding thing issue", "69:55", "it's just", "69:56", "it's the financial crisis from the", "69:57", "pandemic you know that there's just", "69:59", "there's things that are", "70:00", "there's cuts across the board yeah they", "70:02", "can also use that as a political ploy", "70:03", "like say we're defunding the police as", "70:05", "well", "70:06", "but really they're cutting education", "70:07", "they're cutting right all sorts of", "70:09", "services we're all suffering right now", "70:10", "because of the financial crisis that's", "70:12", "going on from this covered crap but", "70:14", "in addition then you've got that plus", "70:16", "the covet stuff and", "70:17", "i mean you've got departments who are", "70:19", "going to be really strapped", "70:21", "for you know for for being able to hire", "70:24", "and then like you said", "70:26", "who wants to go into this job now um", "70:29", "in fact when i do these i'm still doing", "70:31", "some evaluations right now and", "70:33", "and the question that i start off is", "70:35", "what why do you want to do this", "70:37", "given the current climate you know", "70:39", "what's what", "70:40", "what makes you want to be an officer", "70:42", "just to hear what their thoughts are you", "70:44", "know and", "70:45", "and to sort of get get into their mind a", "70:47", "little bit on on what is it that makes", "70:49", "you want to do this", "70:50", "because really you got to be um", "70:53", "you got to be second guessing your", "70:55", "options here at this point um because", "70:57", "it's it's not an easy time to be a cop", "70:59", "what if", "71:00", "if i gave you a magic wand and uh or the", "71:03", "president did", "71:03", "and the president said look nancy we

like it i don't even know total", "71:31", "therapist trick that we do", "71:32", "in your life if things could be perfect", "71:34", "what would it look like so look at you", "71:36", "okay so yeah if i could you are", "71:40", "you didn't even know", "71:43", "if i could just take over and make all", "71:45", "the changes", "71:46", "um honestly i would take the advice", "71:50", "of the amazing people who have done a", "71:53", "ton of work", "71:54", "already in you know about five years ago", "71:56", "there was a task force put together", "71:59", "on you know recommendations for what", "72:01", "should 21st century policing look like", "72:03", "and they lay out in a you know like 170", "72:07", "page document", "72:09", "what policing should look like and this", "72:11", "really amazingly brilliant group of", "72:13", "people came", "72:14", "up with some excellent advice and it", "72:17", "talks about racism and it talks about", "72:19", "technology and it talks about", "72:21", "community-oriented policing and it talks", "72:23", "about", "72:23", "wellness and all the things that i see", "72:26", "that are missing", "72:27", "it's been sitting there for five years", "72:29", "and not to say that nothing has happened", "72:31", "since then", "72:32", "but we certainly haven't enacted what", "72:34", "that task force put together", "72:38", "and what they recommended back then you", "72:40", "know take that", "72:41", "and all the other great work you know", "72:43", "change and reform", "72:45", "right now you see it happening left and", "72:47", "right all over the place right it's it's", "72:49", "it's piecemeal it's haphazard it's it's", "72:51", "political it's let's satisfy the unhappy", "72:53", "folks right now", "72:54", "and i agree that people are demanding", "72:57", "change and they need action they want to", "72:58", "see it right now", "73:00", "i get that it's satisfying to say yes", "73:02", "there's change", "73:04", "but i'm also really concerned", "73:07", "about whether some of these random", "73:09", "haphazard changes are going to make", "73:11", "any different for these real real", "73:13", "problems", "73:14",

with all the issues going on", "97:23", "now you know can we screen out bias and", "97:25", "racism and", "97:26", "and i mentioned it a little bit before", "97:28", "that you know doing so is a really", "97:30", "challenging thing", "97:31", "um we probably will never be able to do", "97:34", "it to the degree that people want us to", "97:37", "um and there's been a lot of talk about", "97:40", "implicit bias", "97:41", "have you had anybody come on and talk", "97:42", "about that kind of stuff the", "97:44", "um you know that the idea that we all", "97:47", "have these kind of

"well can't we um you know can't we", "98:09", "screen for implicit bias in officers and", "98:12", "and you know not hire the people who", "98:14", "have that and i thought well", "98:17", "no because the problem is we all have", "98:19", "them", "98:20", "there's a an online test that millions", "98:22", "of people have taken it was", "98:23", "uh it's connected with harvard it's the", "98:25", "implicit association test it's online", "98:27", "anybody can go take it", "98:29", "and it's really fascinating you can", "98:30", "choose what groups you want to see if", "98:31", "you have bias towards", "98:33", "you know different races there's a black", "98:34", "white one", "98:36", "there's you can do the fat skinny one", "98:40", "you can see if you're you have biases", "98:42", "towards you know different sexual", "98:44", "orientation so you choose which bias you", "98:46", "want to investigate you take this test", "98:48", "and basically it's", "98:48", "saying the the whole premises if you", "98:51", "have these associations", "98:53", "um you know if if you have the a bias", "98:56", "like", "98:57", "against black folks then what they do", "98:59", "during the test is they flash up like a", "99:01", "picture", "99:01", "of white and black people and then", "99:03", "positive and negative words", "99:04", "and you have to respond according to", "99:07", "instructions for keystrokes and that the", "99:08", "notion is", "99:10", "if you associate you know a black", "99:13", "if you have a negative bias towards", "99:14", "black folks you're going to associate", "99:16", "the black faces with the negative words", "99:18", "you're going to respond faster oh that", "99:19", "seems so crazy", "99:20", "this test has been around forever but is", "99:22", "that real i mean that has to be really", "99:24", "criticized", "99:25", "so what's funny is that so it is if", "99:28", "you're", "99:28", "a testing person so in my day job a bit", "99:31", "of a testing but the thing is it's not", "99:32", "life", "99:33", "it's it's not and that's exactly kind of", "99:35", "the point that i thought was important", "99:36", "to me because you hear a lot about this", "99:38", "and people are like well give that i'm", "99:40", "like well there's some major problems", "99:41", "first of all from testing standards", "99:43", "you can take it twice and you're", "99:45", "probably going to score differently well", "99:46", "that's a problem you could juke that", "99:48", "system you could like go oh i know what", "99:50", "they want me to do", "99:51", "they want so if what if you were an", "99:53", "actual racist and you took that but you", "99:55", "knew they were looking for racist you", "99:57", "would pretend", "99:58", "so the theory behind the test is is that", "100:00", "it supersedes that", "100:01", "because it's instant and it's fast it's", "100:03", "how quickly you realize", "100:04", "but you know what you're doing and so", "100:06", "the theory is that", "100:07", "because these are below the surface that", "100:10", "it gets around", "100:11", "trying to manipulate it that's the idea", "100:13", "i'm not i'm not advocating and saying", "100:15", "it's perfect", "100:16", "um but those who support it would say", "100:18", "it's a big deal", "100:20", "what scares me is that people have", "100:22", "wanted to use that in", "100:24", "screening and we can't because number", "100:27", "one it's implicit", "100:28", "we all have these biases right number", "100:31", "two just having it", "100:32", "does not predict whether or not you", "100:35", "would ever act on a bias", "100:36", "right so it's it's there is no there", "100:38", "there's no good research that shows that", "100:40", "having implicit bias meaning you will", "100:42", "you will act in a racist way right so", "100:44", "there's not a connection there so that's", "100:45", "the second problem", "100:46", "but what what stands out to me is", "100:48", "there's there's people who are like now", "100:50", "doing these implicit bias trainings", "100:53", "and it's and they're doing it for for", "100:55", "officers", "100:56", "and i'm not saying this is a bad thing", "100:58", "or knocking it there's some research", "100:59", "that supports and shows that", "101:01", "if we want to and if we're if we are", "101:04", "actively engaging and trying that we can", "101:06", "change our implicit bias like we can", "101:10", "once we become aware of it we can do", "101:11", "things to counter it and to change it", "101:13", "and decrease it", "101:14", "and that's a great notion but they're", "101:17", "trying really hard to implement this", "101:18", "into the world of police work", "101:20", "because it's kind of one of the only", "101:22", "things going right", "101:23", "um and for me i'm i'm not as on this", "101:26", "bandwagon yet i need to see a whole lot", "101:28", "more evidence that this works because", "101:30", "while i have seen research it shows it's", "101:32", "possible to change your implicit bias", "101:34", "i have not seen anything that directly", "101:37", "applies to police work", "101:39", "um and and again it may still be out", "101:41", "there maybe i haven't come out", "101:43", "maybe i haven't come across the studies", "101:44", "or i haven't seen it yet there's some", "101:46", "stuff", "101:46", "out there but the problem that i see", "101:49", "that makes me most", "101:50", "nervous about it or or reluctant to kind", "101:52", "of jump on board here", "101:53", "is that you really it takes a lot of", "101:56", "effort", "101:57", "it takes you know desire and practice", "102:00", "and effort", "102:01", "um and and to make those kind of changes", "102:04", "and i", "102:04", "just you know if you've you've probably", "102:07", "never", "102:07", "worked for a company where you've been", "102:09", "required to go to a diversity training", "102:11", "i've been to", "102:12", "probably a dozen at this point over the", "102:14", "course of my career how fun", "102:15", "are they horrible 90 of them are", "102:18", "horrible", "102:18", "i've been to maybe two that were amazing", "102:21", "what's horrible", "102:22", "about um they're canned they're they're", "102:26", "a lot of them just don't give much", "102:28",

and", "102:38", "and if you feel this way you're wrong", "102:40", "and if you do this you're wrong", "102:42", "and it just sort of makes you leave", "102:44", "feeling like a horrible person", "102:46", "um and but can you be specific like", "102:49", "what kind of questions are they asking", "102:51", "you", "102:52", "oh gosh i think of a good like specific", "102:55", "example", "102:56", "it's been a while since i've had to go", "102:57", "to any of them and the most recent one i", "102:59", "went to actually was pretty", "103:00", "fantastic um it's more like", "103:04", "you know here's what here's what what", "103:07", "white people", "103:08", "are like here's what black people are", "103:10", "like and they're based on these over", "103:12", "generalizations and stereotypes and", "103:14", "maybe i've just been", "103:16", "maybe i've just gone to a lot of bad", "103:17", "trainings in my in the", "103:19", "agencies that i've worked for and they", "103:20",

"103:29", "sounds biased not so much", "103:31", "bias but more general generalization", "103:35", "it can be i think it's just they", "103:38", "they try to or at least a lot of the", "103:40", "groups that have put them on try to make", "103:42", "it", "103:43", "very broad so it'll fit a wide audience", "103:45", "that they deliver it to but it becomes", "103:46", "so broad that it just feels like", "103:49", "like this this isn't very helpful so it", "103:52", "seems like something's useful", "103:54", "that they have to do to show they're", "103:56", "doing something right", "103:57", "and so i think a lot of those and you", "104:00", "know police departments are", "104:01", "being required to do diversity training", "104:03", "so whenever i hear that kind of cringe",

"104:22", "they they explained you know the process", "104:26", "of sort of", "104:26", "exploring one's thoughts and feelings it", "104:29", "was not so much accusatory but", "104:31", "you know here are some of the things", "104:33", "that that folks who are really", "104:35", "interested can do and you know you can", "104:38", "you know and here are some people who", "104:40", "are doing good

are listening", "107:24", "you know i think the most important", "107:26", "thing that we talked about other than", "107:28", "the", "107:28", "nonsense of defunding the police is this", "107:31", "this psychological aspect of the", "107:33", "pressure and the", "107:34", "high stress and then the the amount of", "107:37", "downtime that a human being requires to", "107:39", "sort of",

of cops that were maybe under", "108:22", "stress before", "108:24", "you know maybe in a not so great place", "108:27", "for whatever reason just the jobs", "108:28", "wearing on them or they've been in a", "108:30", "major incident and they're still", "108:31", "recovering from that and then combine", "108:33", "that with just this", "108:34", "pervasive anti-cop and all of that that", "108:37",

years what", "108:49", "is the rate", "108:50", "so the rate well", "108:53", "in terms of like percentages it's almost", "108:55", "impossible to give a good number because", "108:57", "it depends on", "108:58", "what your what your comparison group is", "109:00", "i know in", "109:01", "2018 i think there were recorded", "109:04", "known about 172", "109:07", "suicides and then in 2019 it was up to", "109:10", "like 228", "109:11", "and i'm scared to know what 2020 might", "109:14", "look like given all the other hardships", "109:16", "well just suicide in general is way", "109:18", "upright suicide in general is high so i", "109:20", "can only imagine", "109:21", "and there's a little bit of argument", "109:22", "depending on what stats you look at as", "109:24", "to", "109:24",

"109:40", "um uh so like one of the numbers quoted", "109:44", "out there like", "109:44", "for the general population it's about um", "109:47", "12 or 13 per 100 000 people would commit", "109:50", "suicide and for police officers it's", "109:52", "more like 17 or 18 people out of a", "109:54", "hundred thousand so you know we see", "109:56", "differences", "109:57", "in in the rates and again all that stuff", "110:00", "we talked about before", "110:01", "feeds into that tough culture not going", "110:03", "to ask for help", "110:04", "um and one of i think the most", "110:06", "interesting things", "110:08", "interesting and frustrating for me is", "110:10", "that of the other psychologists i've", "110:12", "talked to that have", "110:13", "worked with agencies and you know i'm", "110:14", "like how do we get in there and break", "110:16", "down that", "110:17", "barrier how do i get them to come to me", "110:20", "and when they need help so that we can", "110:22", "prevent the suicides and then how can", "110:24", "you help them once they do come to you", "110:26", "so if i can get them to me i can i mean", "110:29", "i can't be all knowing and all perfect", "110:32", "if we can get them to a psychologist", "110:34", "we can help them you think so in most", "110:37", "cases for suicide yeah", "110:39", "because there's always hope suicide is", "110:41", "when you've just lost the hope and you", "110:42", "feel like that pain is never going to", "110:44", "end and you don't", "110:45", "you see no way out and and we we can", "110:48", "help", "110:48", "with that if we know it's there and we", "110:50", "know what to look for i feel very", "110:52", "confident that when you get a good", "110:54", "therapist and you get someone in with a", "110:56", "good therapist we can help", "110:58", "but it's when they don't reach out and", "111:00", "that is the biggest", "111:01", "problem with with officers is that they", "111:03", "will suffer in silence", "111:05", "and they will go every other which way", "111:07", "it turns into depression or they have", "111:08", "ptsd", "111:09", "or they're using substances to cope with", "111:12", "the difficulties and", "111:13", "you know all the other things that", "111:15", "compound on there", "111:16", "that what's the best way to get them", "111:20", "into the office so we can help them and", "111:22", "a great line", "111:23", "and now i'm going to blank and i'm so", "111:25", "sorry for whoever it was i'm stealing", "111:26", "this from but another psychologist said", "111:28", "when she's like", "111:29", "you got to be like the furniture and i'm", "111:31", "like what does that mean she's like", "111:33", "in the department you got to be like a", "111:35", "coat wreck or a chair like they're so", "111:37", "used to seeing you there", "111:38", "it's like oh hey doc you know hey what's", "111:41", "up hi dr panza i'm like hey you know", "111:43", "like they're so used to seeing you", "111:45", "and you're just like one of them that's", "111:48", "when they come talk to you", "111:50", "so that's that was one of the things", "111:51", "that stood out be the furniture like", "111:53", "but the thing that's frustrating about", "111:55", "that is it's hard for departments to", "111:58", "open their doors and let outsiders in", "112:00", "you know what", "112:01", "it's it's hard to say you know okay here", "112:03", "i'm i'm available or", "112:05", "you've got a contract with this company", "112:06", "so that anybody who needs therapy can go", "112:09", "um

"112:41", "departments to open that door and to", "112:43", "kind of", "112:44", "accept you as as as part of them well", "112:47", "doesn't it depend entirely upon the", "112:49", "personality of the psychologist as well", "112:51", "yeah some people would be really", "112:53", "annoying to have around yes like you", "112:55", "would be great to have around you're a", "112:56", "nice person",
