I", "43:28", "don't know infrastructure and black", "43:29", "communities and if that's the case well", "43:31", "then let's incentivize keeping the", "43:33", "parents they're keeping the parents", "43:34", "together or if they're split up it's", "43:36", "just like if you guys are teaching your", "43:37", "kid and he and he's in school every day", "43:39", "or he survives you know eight years of", "43:40", "school shooting every family gets like", "43:43", "you know a big bonus you know or if if", "43:46", "he makes the Honor Roll you know like", "43:47", "you guys get this it's like you

plantation you know", "46:03", "fortune I'm not saying that I'm saying", "46:05", "that", "46:06", "the the smart thing to do would be to", "46:08", "figure out what damage was select if", "46:10",
