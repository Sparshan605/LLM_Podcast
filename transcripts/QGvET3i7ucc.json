universe and he's like the", "05:19", "problem is space moves faster than light", "05:23", "the universe is moving faster than the", "05:25", "speed of light so what we're seeing is", "05:29", "what we can see from 14 billion years", "05:31", "ago because but that doesn't mean that's", "05:33", "all there is right he goes space itself", "05:35", "beyond bending but if what he's saying", "05:38",

when you're", "05:47", "talking about the observable universe", "05:48", "being I think it's thirteen point", "05:50", "something billion yet almost 14 billion", "05:53", "years old that's just how far back we", "05:55", "can see he's like but before that like", "05:58", "when you go back further yeah it's not", "06:00", "really nothing greenair that's right", "06:02", "it's just that we can't see it because", "06:04", "the space itself is moving faster than", "06:07", "the speed of light that's right and", "06:09", "you're also what you're looking at is", "06:10", "not only the edge of the universe but", "06:12", "the edge of time yeah because they're", "06:14", "not even the edge what he's saying is", "06:16", "it's it's very likely that not only is", "06:20", "it infinite but there's an infinite", "06:21", "number of possibilities beyond it yes", "06:24", "and those things beyond it may also be", "06:26", "right alongside us I mean in terms of", "06:28", "the other dimensions and things like", "06:30", "that like he didn't even get into all of", "06:31", "it all of that stuff but if you believe", "06:33", "in string theory and quantum physics and", "06:35", "if you believe in math then you sort of", "06:37", "have to well it's quite", "06:39", "physics and string theory - a dope like", "06:41", "me is one of those things where I have", "06:43", "to kind of take your word

questions", "07:02", "but we can go in a key food that's why", "07:03", "it's so important to to appreciate like", "07:06", "when people are science deniers it's so", "07:08", "frustrating because

notion of Jesus yes but that's", "09:15", "not it hang on III do quibble with the", "09:18", "idea that this that you can't be smart", "09:20", "Stephen Colbert is one of the matters", "09:22", "well the word smart this is what the", "09:24", "problem is like we define smart well you", "09:27", "stupid shit are you smart you are", "09:28", "implying that the reason why Bill", "09:30", "O'Reilly talks about tide goes in tide", "09:32", "goes out is because he's pandering to", "09:34", "people because he's a Harvard guy and", "09:36", "there's no way that he would be dumb", "09:37", "enough to believe that no I'm complying", "09:40", "that because I looked at the way he said", "09:41", "it and I know what he does and I think", "09:43", "he's manipulative and I think what he's", "09:45",

"10:26", "ago", "10:26", "is crazy magic talk well it's crazy talk", "10:29", "but there are people that are religious", "10:30", "that are extremely intelligent and I", "10:32", "agree with you on this like Jordan", "10:34", "Peterson right who's a brilliant man who", "10:36", "is very religious in the sense that he", "10:39", "studies religion and he believes there's", "10:41", "some

but you found them in Qumran", "11:43", "these scrolls were written on animal", "11:47", "skin so they were broken up", "11:49", "so to piece them back together they had", "11:51", "to do DNA testing to make sure that the", "11:53", "piece of skin came from the same cow and", "11:55", "then they had to try to figure out okay", "11:57", "where does all this shit go and then how", "11:59", "to how
