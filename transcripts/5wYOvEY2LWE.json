you", "08:53", "know training as you go along that's", "08:54", "what I did the first ten Matins trains", "08:56", "you for the next 33 what was it like", "08:59", "when you go over the first day though", "09:01", "the first marathon is okay fuck my first", "09:03", "days okay because well it's all in your", "09:06", "head there's a more mental than it is", "09:10", "physical and so the first math that I've", "09:12", "heard of people running marathons run", "09:13", "walk stagger", "09:14", "not very fast we'll get it done boom the", "09:16", "second marathon is we cuz you go I've", "09:19", "done one I'm on the second and you can't", "09:21", "really rejoice you can't punch the sky", "09:23", "you can't put a medal around your neck", "09:24", "you already you got up at 5:00 or 6:00", "09:27", "in the morning and you're it's midday", "09:28", "and you're you're going through your", "09:30", "second one then get through the third", "09:31", "one and then you through the fourth one", "09:32", "and then it was raining and my feet was", "09:34", "shredding and all of the moisture it was", "09:37", "yes it made it too soft you know and", "09:39", "they were rubbing on the on the running", "09:41", "shoes and I didn't know however how do I", "09:45", "fix it when I'm actually wearing on it", "09:47", "all the time so we started bathing it in", "09:49", "surgical spirit which you call something", "09:50", "else it's a it's an ethanol methanol", "09:54", "anyways it's some sort of alcoholic", "09:56", "spirit and it it takes the moisture out", "09:59", "of your feet and so stones it's come out", "10:05", "which a anyway if anyone doesn't have", "10:08", "some surgical spare if you google it now", "10:09", "you'll see what it's called in America", "10:11", "but it's it's some sort of alcoholic", "10:13", "thing that just removes moisture and so", "10:15", "it made my feet my toes like little", "10:16", "stones and kind of tough and actually", "10:19", "that got us through and then I started", "10:21", "and also apparently because I did 27", "10:23", "marathons in 27 days in South Africa in", "10:25", "2016 and that was the temperatures were", "10:28", "crazy on that but it seems that the body", "10:29", "will switch on a healing property that", "10:31", "we've got latent in ourselves that we", "10:33", "don't use and you will heal quicker you", "10:37", "will heal faster the more you get so I", "10:39", "got so you get stronger both the British", "10:41", "one and the South African one I got", "10:43", "stronger as I went on really the first", "10:45", "10 days are the other key thing and", "10:46", "after that it's kind of easier you're", "10:48", "used to it your body just adapts and he", "10:50", "understands yep this crazy asshole yeah", "10:53", "so and the brain goes", "10:54", "what kind of mouth and shall we run", "10:56", "today as opposed to what kind of", "10:59", "marathon yeah well I think that's what", "11:01", "the brain is doing cuz the first day", "11:02", "that", "11:02", "is going you're gonna do what this", "11:04", "marathon but be okay", "11:06", "the second day the brain is going now", "11:07", "we're gonna we're doing another one", "11:09", "third day fourth day fifth day this is", "11:12", "insane and then day ten the brain is", "11:13", "going okay you're on this kind of kick", "11:15", "or something", "11:16", "I understand let's let's try better", "11:19", "Mathis don't push it too hard you know", "11:21", "you the brain starts talking to the body", "11:23", "and somehow it levels out roundabout", "11:25", "main then it gets surreal math at 18", "11:28", "math and 23 I remember marathon 31 just", "11:33", "so weird there's a lot of there are", "11:35", "subconscious behaviors that go on time", "11:37", "why are people so goddamn crazy", "11:39", "I don't know trauma you know that Carl", "11:41", "Jung is it the Carl Jung fucking the", "11:45", "line that says that which we don't work", "11:47", "out in our subconscious we will act out", "11:50", "as fate in our lives how about that cuz", "11:54", "you will relive patterns you'll relive", "11:56", "trauma

keep falling into the same problem", "12:06", "why after two years does this go bad", "12:08", "what what is that well there's a way to", "12:10", "actually creatively at least sit with", "12:13",
