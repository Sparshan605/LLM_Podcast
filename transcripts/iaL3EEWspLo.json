responsibility always in all", "10:53", "things should fall on the individual but", "10:56", "now it's just getting all the", "10:58", "individuals to actually have", "11:00", "responsibility that's where it gets", "11:02", "really really stupid", "11:04", "yeah there's", "11:05", "there's just there's just people that", "11:07", "they're not good people they don't they", "11:09", "weren't raised

expensive insured show that", "112:20", "ever done I would imagine and they're", "112:23", "just some things", "112:26", "we know shit took explosives TNT threw", "112:31", "them from the side of a helicopter to", "112:33", "cause avalanches that I'm that I'm in", "112:38", "and so do you have one of those", "112:41", "inflatable suits it keeps you from", "112:42", "getting tweetly compressed yeah we tried", "112:44", "that one time uh that I definitely use", "112:47", "that and I think that saves me one time", "112:49", "it kept me up on top so those things", "112:51", "don't keep you from being compressed it", "112:53", "keeps you on top it's like it's like a", "112:54", "flotation device a life preserver for", "112:57", "the snow so it gives you more surface", "112:59", "area friction which rises you does that", "113:02", "mean like when you have a big jar of", "113:04", "pebbles and you shake them the biggest", "113:05", "ones go to the top right it's that's all", "113:07", "that's happening is you're trying to", "113:08", "make yourself the biggest pebble to", "113:10", "raise you to the top of this huge", "113:12", "friction so because most people they", "113:15", "actually die of traumatic injuries", "113:17", "during the avalanche not from a fixation", "113:21", "really even though when they finally put", "113:24", "me in the avalanche", "113:26", "I was I was inside of the snow for 30", "113:29", "minutes that was the amount of time that", "113:31", "the network would let us would let me", "113:33", "see if I could survive and I had I had a", "113:35", "button if I clicked it every minute on", "113:38", "the bottom of the minute they would", "113:39", "leave me in there for another minute so", "113:42", "I stayed in for 29:59 and so as soon as", "113:45", "it's over 30 they're like that's it", "113:47", "that's all the time we allow yep Wow", "113:49", "what was it like in there for this", "113:50", "really cold", "113:51", "yeah super cold it was dark it was hard", "113:55", "to figure out which way was up so I", "113:59", "figured out which way was up cuz I was", "114:01", "able to like I took my snowboarding", "114:04", "goggles I put them over my mouth", "114:05", "so the snow went so I'd initially have a", "114:07", "little bit of a few breaths of air", "114:11", "because what happens is you get an ice", "114:13", "seal around your face from you exhaling", "114:17", "melting it and then it freezes so then", "114:20", "you have this cocoon of no fresh air", "114:23", "coming in so I was able to so I locked", "114:26", "my hand inside of my helmet and I held", "114:28", "my goggles over my mouth so I would have", "114:31", "a little bit of air so then I was able", "114:32", "to take that off and get it over my so", "114:35", "that I have a little bit of air here and", "114:36", "that was like moving snow with my pin", "114:39", "and to but then I saw a drip of water", "114:42", "drip off of my glasses at a 45-degree", "114:45", "angle to my left that's like Oh up is", "114:48", "that way", "114:48", "that's route that was like the best", "114:50", "thing for my brain to know which way up", "114:51", "was that was the only way you could tell", "114:53", "yeah was because you just you're", "114:55", "weightless no wow that's a crazy feeling", "114:58", "like you don't know where the up is yeah", "115:00", "so up could be your feet okay absolutely", "115:03", "yeah you wouldn't even know no so I just", "115:06", "gravity watching that drop of water drip", "115:10", "off of my snow goggles as like aa piece", "115:14", "for my brain what if it went up I would", "115:16", "I would have pissed myself what if you", "115:19", "like spit there's no moving you either", "115:27", "get rescued or you freeze to death and", "115:28", "so there's this is not a controlled", "115:30", "Avalanche they're just so you're just", "115:31", "actually starting an avalanche yeah how", "115:34", "many of these episodes you planning on", "115:36", "doing Tim I mean can we stop now no I", "115:39", "think I think we got a bunch of people", "115:41", "that the world needs to know about that", "115:43", "that we take for granted how we get our", "115:45", "food how we get our gas how we get our", "115:47", "Wow and I think I got a bunch of Special", "115:50", "Forces recruiting slots I need to fill", "115:52", "and this is the way to do it", "115:54", "I hope cells killing yourself every week", "115:56", "I didn't I mean I went oh I almost only", "115:59", "died three times in this in this first", "116:02", "season and if somebody's like that's a", "116:08", "cool job or wait the only way that Tim", "116:10", "I'm there there are some times where", "116:12", "you're watching me inside of a cockpit", "116:14", "that's on fire and the only way I got", "116:16", "out is because I'm a savage", "116:18", "like I'm just a beast I was like I don't", "116:20", "feel like getting burnt alive today", "116:22", "so I tear the cockpit open I think", "116:25", "somebody at some point is gonna draw the", "116:27", "conclusion that I was able to do that", "116:29", "because of physicality that if you're a", "116:30", "fat person sitting inside of there", "116:32", "you would be burnt alive maybe they'd", "116:35", "get off their couch and they'd go and do", "116:37", "something maybe they there's a weird way", "116:39", "to motivate people anywhere anyways a", "116:41", "good way I'll take it", "116:44", "whose idea was this for this show that's", "116:46", "my idea Jesus Christ dude you're an", "116:49", "unusual human it's fun though and how", "116:53", "many of these episodes have you done we", "116:54", "have finished six and you know that is", "116:58", "that the entire season yeah that'll be", "116:59", "season one comes out in July you excited", "117:03", "about it yeah I'm pumped so 50% of the", "117:05", "time you almost died yeah yeah I mean", "117:08", "that's gross math rounding around okay", "117:12", "so there's the water one well you almost", "117:14", "froze to death yep that definitely and", "117:16", "then the avalanche one you know when you", "117:19", "lasted 30 minutes what was the other one", "117:21", "oh man yeah worse yeah it was less", "117:27", "pleasant like I was a bullfighter for an", "117:31", "episode oh dude", "117:33", "and not a bull rider cuz they're insane", "117:36", "but the bullfighter is the guy that's on", "117:38", "the ground so when the bullfighter gets", "117:39", "thrown he's The Bodyguard for the bull", "117:42", "rider his only job is to take the hit so", "117:46", "the bull rider doesn't get trampled to", "117:49", "death because the moment the bull rider", "117:51", "comes off the bull's back", "117:52", "the bull is turning around to crush", "117:54", "whatever was on its back right and", "117:57", "that's where the bullfighter runs in to", "117:58", "save him and you know the the PBR the", "118:02", "Professional Bull Riders Association", "118:03", "those guys are the most selfless", "118:08", "courageous guys trying to protect those", "118:10", "bullfighters bull riders so I trained", "118:15", "for a while and I was went to the", "118:18", "biggest rodeo in the nation and was", "118:21", "bullfighter and I mean this isn't one of", "118:25", "those shows where people don't get hurt", "118:26", "like you see the inside of my body you", "118:29", "see people get really really really", "118:32", "jacked up and go to the hospital and", "118:34", "like you have a punctured lung is that", "118:36", "guy gonna live this is that type of show", "118:39", "cuz there's no other way to do it the", "118:42", "only thing the only direction we had", "118:43", "from Discovery was don't fake anything", "118:46", "that's a great direction it's great", "118:48", "direction and glad they came up with", "118:49", "that know what happened with the bull", "118:54", "well I I got oh", "118:56", "which is humiliating because they're not", "118:58", "really smart animals you I you're fast", "119:02", "over there Jamie's a wizard", "119:04", "yeah it's encourage all

lead to permanent", "119:14", "brain damage or need of an orthopedic", "119:17", "surgeon lets you legs up and a bowl", "119:23", "launching you through the air yeah that", "119:26", "was the training week so this was when", "119:29", "you're trying to distract the ball yeah", "119:32", "what kind of techniques do you use", "119:34", "football running back stuff just jus", "119:37", "come young way that faking things that", "119:40", "the thing is you actually have to sell", "119:42", "that body movement so your weight half", "119:45", "your weight has to shift far enough", "119:48", "where the bowl is gonna really believe", "119:50", "that you're gonna go to that direction", "119:52", "I wish Bulls were so I wish they're", "119:57", "dumber than they are because they're not", "119:58", "because if you fake them once one", "120:01", "direction they won't take it the next", "120:02", "time they'll they'll you try to fake to", "120:05", "the right they'll already start going", "120:07", "running to left so then you fake to the", "120:08", "right you go back to the left and you're", "120:09", "like oh no I have done and it's at that", "120:12", "moment that Tim realized he had fucked", "120:15", "up yeah then it just gets owned I got", "120:17", "destroyed and so when you get launched", "120:20", "to the air by a bull it's it's it's", "120:23", "weird because it's it's weightless you", "120:26", "know it's just a second and you are", "120:30", "completely inverted no control over", "120:33", "where your body is going because you", "120:35", "didn't generate that energy but the", "120:38", "other part of you the other part of your", "120:40", "brain is knowing that that bowl is gonna", "120:42", "try to turn as fast as it can and get", "120:45", "you when you land on the ground because", "120:47", "that's when it's really good is when", "120:49", "you're down yeah so you're trying to", "120:53", "keep track of where this bowl is while", "120:55", "you're hurling through the air like okay", "120:58", "I got to tuck my chin so I don't break", "120:59", "my neck you know hopefully I'm not close", "121:02", "enough to the fence which the fence", "121:03",
