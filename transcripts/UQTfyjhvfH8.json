someone", "07:22", "you see them getting more and more and", "07:24", "more emotional and people on the right", "07:25", "love this because of course it's the", "07:26", "triggering of the snowflakes

ramping", "08:55", "things up so I think there's a new", "08:57", "mentality out there it's the this", "08:59", "intersectionality politics on the left", "09:01", "that says that they're a bunch of victim", "09:03", "groups basically are their blacks and", "09:04", "Hispanics and gays and Jews and Asians", "09:06", "they're all victim groups and we get", "09:07", "those all those people together

there", "39:19", "first of all it's not true but second of", "39:21", "all I think maybe there was also a part", "39:23", "of the problem was that commis a giant", "39:25", "yes no chump come easy six eight six", "39:28", "nine years giant dude towered over thing", "39:31", "is such a comedy and Comey saying he was", "39:33", "trying to hide in the curtains to avoid", "39:35", "Trump they just see

to probably join more but if", "39:48", "I see a fucking Korean missile headed", "39:50", "our way I'm gonna be pissed when Comey", "39:53", "was handling the email thing what", "39:55", "specifically did you not like about it", "39:57", "what I thought it was was crazy was when", "40:00", "he restarted or reopened the case", "40:02", "because of whom having used her cleaner", "40:06", "with wieners all that stuff is like", "40:10", "that's not enough like that seems crazy", "40:12", "the the deleting the emails to me seemed", "40:15", "like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA", "40:18", "and he said essentially anyone else", "40:21", "would be in jail for what she did sure", "40:23", "for sure sure well Comey that this is so", "40:25", "he screwed it up and then he Reese crude",

"40:33", "FBI does not decide whether to prosecute", "40:35", "people they refer the information to the", "40:37", "DOJ and then the DOJ decides whether to", "40:39", "prosecute people it was attorney

HIPAA that", "41:05", "says that if she reveals somebody's you", "41:07", "know proprietary medical information by", "41:09", "accident well there's no intent so she's", "41:11", "okay that's not part

something that's a crime", "41:18", "doesn't matter if she intended to do it", "41:20", "and just left it in her purse so Comey", "41:22", "read the elements of intent into the", "41:23", "crime to get Hillary off and then he", "41:25", "said okay we're not gonna prosecute this", "41:26", "we're gonna leave it alone he shouldn't", "41:28", "have intervene in the first place", "41:29", "remember he made an entire case", "41:30", "basically for why she should be", "41:31", "prosecuted and then at the end he goes", "41:33", "but were you no but no we're not gonna", "41:35", "do that", "41:35",

"41:43", "all sorts of information on it with new", "41:45", "emails from Hillary Clinton they haven't", "41:46", "seen before", "41:47", "and now he has an obligation to inform", "41:49", "Congress because he told them that he", "41:50", "would and so he screws the pooch again", "41:52", "because he's afraid that if he doesn't", "41:54", "reveal that information Hillary goes on", "41:56", "to win and then it comes out there's", "41:57", "something criminal then people are going", "41:59", "to blame him for Hillary winning and", "42:00", "putting a criminal in the White House", "42:01",

he's", "43:00", "handling Russia I mean that's really", "43:04", "stupid", "43:04", "yeah that's intensely stupid it's", "43:06", "intensely stupid but it's also strange", "43:08", "that it didn't go

mean", "43:31", "the obstruction laws I mean I've looked", "43:32", "into kind of the statutes that they've", "43:34", "used to suggest obstruction and it's not", "43:36", "clear that there's any statute that", "43:38", "specifically governs something like this", "43:39", "plus it is true that Trump does have the", "43:41", "power as the chief executive to fire as", "43:44", "the

crimes", "44:11", "that they come up with but these are all", "44:13", "political definitions right when it says", "44:14", "high crimes and misdemeanors it doesn't", "44:16", "mean they actually have

"44:41", "hide", "44:41", "that's why he gets her to Flynn we don't", "44:43", "know why he got rid of Flynn he gets rid", "44:45", "of Comey we don't really know why he got", "44:46", "rid of Comey and then brags to the", "44:47", "Russians that it's a pressure off him on", "44:49", "the Russia stuff yeah so the way one is", "44:50", "he's hiding something and now he's", "44:52", "firing everybody who gets in the way and", "44:53", "there's you know the chain of evidence", "44:55", "doesn't not fit that I mean you know the", "44:58", "people he's angry at in order are", "45:00", "attorney General Sessions the Deputy", "45:01", "Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the", "45:03", "former head of the FBI James Comey the", "45:05", "acting head of the FBI McCabe and and", "45:08",

"something to be said for the idea that", "45:16", "maybe he's trying to hide something on", "45:17", "the other hand we haven't actually seen", "45:19", "any hard evidence of collusion itself so",

"45:29", "Trump administration which was then", "45:30", "being weaponized for use in the campaign", "45:32", "we haven't seen any of that stuff so", "45:33", "here's the other plausible theory and", "45:35", "this goes to Trump's personality he's so", "45:37", "petty and he wants to be loved so much", "45:39", "that he is angry that people keep saying", "45:42", "he run because he won because of the", "45:43", "Russians and so now every time people", "45:46", "say that he just gets pissed and he", "45:47", "fires people so call me I mean this is", "45:50", "totally plausible right Comey comes to", "45:52", "him and has said privately that you are", "45:54", "not under investigation and Trump says", "45:56", "Tim well why don't you just say that and", "45:59", "Comey says well I can't say that cuz if", "46:01", "I say that I'm gonna have to update", "46:02", "Congress if you do fall under", "46:03", "investigation and Trump doesn't like", "46:05", "that he wants the public to know

these", "46:12", "people leave me alone right so he is so", "46:14", "there's two ways to read this either", "46:15", "he's totally innocent but stupid or he's", "46:18", "trying to hide something those are the", "46:20", "only two plausible ways of reading the", "46:21", "situation the Donald Trump jr. thing was", "46:23", "really bizarre because he released all", "46:25", "the emails like I just yeah it's like", "46:28", "look I've got nothing to hide like you", "46:30", "aren't supposed to do any of these", "46:32", "things you're saying in these emails yes", "46:34", "that was not a good moment for for Trump", "46:36", "jr. do you think he got I mean and then", "46:38", "you hear that he was coached by his dad", "46:40", "again you know", "46:41", "this is none of this is good stuff I", "46:43", "think that Donald Trump jr. releasing", "46:45", "the first of all it is imperative to", "46:47", "note eight minutes later the New York", "46:48", "Times released basically the email", "46:50", "change right so he was meeting he's", "46:52", "beating out of the gate and so he puts", "46:53", "that out there which is a smart move I", "46:55", "mean it would be smart if you it would", "46:56", "be smart if he had found a way to spin", "46:58", "it right right like have you done it if", "47:00", "you don't this is the thing in politics", "47:01", "now the way politics works now is your", "47:03", "smartest move if there's dirt about you", "47:05", "is to be the first person out the gate", "47:06", "with it and you put a spin on it right", "47:08", "so like Barack Obama imagine if Obama", "47:10", "hadn't said anything in 2008 and then we", "47:12", "found out a week before the election", "47:13", "that he did coke in high school now a", "47:16", "lot of people wouldn't care a lot of", "47:17", "people would write in 2000 george w bush", "47:19", "was hit with a DUI charge from 1973 and", "47:21", "it probably lost him a point in the", "47:24", "polls", "47:24", "so what obama did is he wrote an entire", "47:27", "memoir and he just kind of dismissed it", "47:29", "right in the middle of the memoir he", "47:29", "goes you know when i was in high school", "47:30", "did a little blow no problem it'll blow", "47:33", "everybody and everyone oh okay did a", "47:35", "little blow alright you know cool so if", "47:36", "you're going to release this kind of", "47:38", "stuff you have to put a spin on it", "47:40", "trump turn your didn't you just put out", "47:41", "the emails and the emails themselves", "47:42", "contain the damning material right it", "47:45", "says right in there right you know", "47:46", "there's a russian government lawyer the", "47:48", "russian government sees this as part of", "47:49", "its effort to aid mr. Trump's campaign", "47:51", "and Donald juniors like thumbs up guys", "47:53", "like I love it sounds awesome right", "47:55", "and so that does not look good it's not", "47:58", "quite as much as you know people on the", "48:00", "Left want to say it is meaning that", "48:01", "there's no evidence yet that any", "48:03", "information was actually exchanged with", "48:05", "the Russians or that anything came of", "48:06", "the meeting most of the people in the", "48:08", "meeting who've said something and said", "48:09", "nothing came of it you know but we don't", "48:11", "know whether Trump knew about the", "48:12", "meeting I find it kind of hard to", "48:13", "believe he didn't you know considering", "48:14", "every major campaign figure was there", "48:16", "but but you know then then they then", "48:19", "they just keep lying and this is this is", "48:21", "the part that's proud that's a problem", "48:22", "are they lying because they just think", "48:25", "they can get away with it and they're", "48:26", "stupid or are they long because they're", "48:27", "actually being meticulous about their", "48:29", "lies yeah I tend to think the former", "48:31", "because this isn't a professional", "48:32", "administration I think these I think", "48:34", "Trump you know fibs a lot he says things", "48:36", "that I mean like on stupid things he", "48:38", "says things like the leader of the Boy", "48:40", "Scouts called me and told me that he", "48:41", "loved my speech ever", "48:42", "and then leader of the Boy Scouts like", "48:44", "what so if so is that a calculated lie", "48:47", "to hide something or is it just the", "48:48", "Trump lies by nature and so he does it a", "48:49", "lot well I think he's just so used to", "48:51", "putting that that spin on things that", "48:53", "publicity spin right", "48:55", "and the thing that he said about this", "48:57", "was that this is what politics does what", "49:00", "happens in politics you get dirt about", "49:02", "your enemy and people exchange", "49:04", "information it's just what happens it's", "49:06", "just you're seeing it now so a lot of", "49:07", "people like yeah well that makes sense", "49:09", "right and this is something that again I", "49:10", "think that we're shaped by Hollywood a", "49:12", "little bit politics is dirty but some of", "49:14", "this stuff is not usual right it's", "49:16", "actually not particularly usual to meet", "49:18", "with a government that is really not", "49:20", "friendly to the United States to receive", "49:22", "information about your political", "49:23", "opponents but if you've watched house of", "49:25", "cards you think well I mean it's like", "49:26", "two steps down from throwing somebody", "49:27", "under the subways I don't because I work", "49:31", "in politics when I go home at night the", "49:32", "last thing I want to do is watch and", "49:33", "read about politics now watch Game of", "49:35", "Thrones that's as political as a guest", "49:36", "yeah house of cards is a great show but", "49:38", "if it's half right like I always wonder", "49:42", "the thing the thing that gets me is when", "49:45", "people suicide themselves that are on", "49:47", "the way to trial I'm like okay I don't", "49:48", "want to be that fucking guy I don't want", "49:50", "to be that tinfoil hat guy but how many", "49:52", "people are gonna suicide themselves I", "49:55", "mean for sure", "49:57", "someone's been murdered somewhere along", "49:59", "the line someone knew something some", "50:01", "powerful people got to them and they", "50:03", "murder them it's gonna happen it has", "50:05", "happened it must have have I mean I", "50:07", "think it happens a lot in Russia I don't", "50:09", "think that I don't believe what Trump", "50:11", "said and again I think this is what", "50:13", "Trump has a skewed vision of what", "50:14", "politics is and because he thinks that", "50:16", "the outer limit of politics is Russia", "50:18", "he thinks anything inside that limit is", "50:20", "now okay but do you think it's ever", "50:22", "happen in the United States or just in", "50:23", "Russia like political assassinations I", "50:25", "can't name a specific example of where", "50:27", "it has I think that that was you open to", "50:29", "the possibility I'm open to the I mean", "50:30", "if someone shows me and Johnson Lynda", "50:32", "John I don't think Lyndon Johnson", "50:35", "wackadoo Kennedy I don't think the", "50:37", "Kennedy whack anybody about Hillary", "50:39", "I don't think Hillary whack any fired up", "50:41", "fired my last thousand bucks I'd be", "50:44", "super tempted to bet on black have you", "50:47", "super tempted to go you know what I", "50:49", "think she went dark a few people let's", "50:53", "see what we got here like you wanna see", "50:55", "white water I'd want to see Vince Foster", "50:57", "I want to see that Enron guy who shot", "50:59", "himself in the head twice you what if I", "51:02", "could if I could really if I could you", "51:05", "know", "51:06", "man I think it's happened I just don't", "51:08", "know I'm sure it's happened at some", "51:10", "point but again if I don't know them and", "51:11", "when I'm hesitant to like why I think", "51:13", "that we and I think that we tend to", "51:14", "think things are regular when they are", "51:15", "they never really irregular Yeah right", "51:18", "so we tend to think that this stuff is", "51:19", "happening like every day and that's why", "51:20", "you see Trump on TV saying well Putin", "51:22", "like America hasn't killed people and", "51:24", "it's like well no not quite like Putin I", "51:26", "mean like Putin legitimately murders his", "51:27", "journalistic enemies yes like I haven't", "51:30", "seen you trying to DoubleTap Jake Tapper", "51:32", "so I'm pretty sure I'm sure no it's not", "51:34", "a regular thing around here even Obama", "51:35", "wasn't trying to like kill Chris Wallace", "51:37", "right but maybe they you know maybe well", "51:42", "Putin is obviously the extreme example", "51:44", "right well obviously the extreme example", "51:45", "is the North Korea but Putin is in that", "51:49", "range", "51:50", "like totally feared essentially a", "51:53", "dictator who's I mean they're a bunch of", "51:55", "Omer I mean Iran and Turkey Maduro a", "51:59", "song yeah Assad Maduro now in Venezuela", "52:01", "who's literally oh like a complete", "52:05", "dictatorship and this is very recently", "52:07", "right but America is a I mean would you", "52:09", "believe it if I said like leaders in", "52:11", "France had people regularly whacked I'd", "52:13", "find it a little bit hard to believe I", "52:14", "don't think we're significantly worse", "52:16", "than France and the whacking people in", "52:17", "politics business I don't think", "52:18", "regularly but I think every now and then", "52:20", "the move is I'm open to the possibility", "52:23", "but I'd have to see the evidence the", "52:24", "lawyer and me well I don't think we're a", "52:26", "house of cards I don't think it's gets", "52:27", "that ridiculous but the point I'm making", "52:29", "is if you think that's a regular thing", "52:30", "if you think that it's not like a rare", "52:32", "thing and maybe once in a while you know", "52:33", "once every 20 years somebody gets", "52:34", "whacked quietly for political reason if", "52:36", "you think that's like a regular thing", "52:37", "then fibbing is like way inside the line", "52:40", "right right like you you hiding", "52:41", "documents is really or you like writing", "52:44", "your son's stupid statement about a", "52:46", "stupid email exchange and then fibbing", "52:48", "about it publicly like that's really", "52:50", "inside the line so again I don't think", "52:51", "that I think some of this I have a rule", "52:54", "about the Trump administration I never", "52:55", "attribute to malevolence what I can", "52:56", "attribute to stupidity because I think", "52:58", "that that's more likely to be the case", "53:01", "it's like the Occam's razor of the", "53:03", "trumpet ministry that is a smart way to", "53:05", "think but I think sometimes malevolence", "53:07", "is real", "53:08", "like I'd like member the Gary Condit", "53:10", "Chandra Levy thing yeah that was weird", "53:11", "that was a weird one where people don't", "53:14", "know the story this guy was having an", "53:15", "affair the girl turned up dead", "53:18", "and then 9/11 happened right away", "53:20", "afterwards so people kind of forgot", "53:22", "about it but they they found her body in", "53:25", "the park and everybody was like Jesus", "53:26", "Christ like this is a woman that was", "53:29", "about to testify that she was having an", "53:31", "affair with this guy and that one was a", "53:34", "good one yeah in terms not not good one", "53:36", "obviously a terrible ones I think so let", "53:39", "me say this I think that you know if", "53:40", "there's murder in politics it'll", "53:41", "probably tend to fall more into the", "53:42", "personal than the political mmm-hmm", "53:44", "it'll probably fall less in terms of", "53:45", "like I have a political vendetta against", "53:47", "this guy and I'm gonna kill him we", "53:48", "haven't really done much of that since", "53:49", "Alexander Hamilton and burr but it's it", "53:53", "but there are eminent listened Teddy", "53:54", "Kennedy left a woman in the back of his", "53:56", "car and a body of water so right drunk", "53:58", "driving right that was the thing with", "54:00", "him he just didn't want to be", "54:01", "responsible for something horrible that", "54:02", "he did very similar to Dick Cheney not", "54:05", "meeting with the police to feel like", "54:08", "something like 18 hours after he shot", "54:10", "his friend in the face yeah I mean I", "54:12", "don't think he was trying to assassinate", "54:13", "his friend drunk hunting and that's", "54:18", "can't rule that one out so yeah but", "54:22", "honestly I'll find Teddy Kennedy a", "54:24", "little more suspicious you leave the", "54:25", "woman in the back of the car swim out of", "54:26", "the car going to a house", "54:28", "sleep come back the next day and my god", "54:30", "she's dead yeah well yeah it turns out", "54:31", "when you leave somebody underwater for", "54:32", "12 hours they tend to do that yeah", "54:35", "that's weird how that works well unless", "54:36", "he was so drunk that he didn't know what", "54:38", "he was doing which can happen you can", "54:40", "get blackout drunk I'm gonna wake up and", "54:42", "going wait a minute did I crash my car", "54:43", "so I don't drink that heavily is that", "54:45", "really a thing like you climbing out the", "54:46", "window the card swim out to the river", "54:48", "bank go to somebody's house come back", "54:51", "like a day later like oh shit there was", "54:54", "a girl in the back seat I've never had", "54:56", "it happen but I have I've had what I", "55:00", "would call slideshow nights you know", "55:02", "where I get hammered and then like I", "55:05", "wake up in the morning with a pounding", "55:06", "headache and and I just just have these", "55:09", "flashes in my head like who is that", "55:10", "person", "55:11", "like where was I where were we oh yeah", "55:14", "there was that and then that you eaten", "55:15", "breakfast with your friends ago you", "55:16", "remember that thing and you go oh yeah", "55:18", "Jesus", "55:21", "necessarily blackout like I did", "55:23", "something horrible and I completely", "55:24", "forgot about it but I forgot a lot of it", "55:26", "okay but some people I have a friend and", "55:29", "he goes gerbil eyes there's", "55:31", "which that goes off three or four shots", "55:33", "in and he's gone and he's not there", "55:35", "anymore", "55:36", "he almost kind of like nerf the world", "55:38", "around him protect him and get him in", "55:39", "his bed", "55:40", "and he wakes up in the morning he", "55:41", "doesn't know a thing doesn't know a", "55:43", "thing about what happened and it's", "55:44", "really bizarre", "55:46", "it's a terrible things Tim well he's now", "55:48", "we're nice to him but your your instinct", "55:52", "is to get the fuck away from him he just", "55:54", "let horrible things happen but the", "55:57", "stories are legendary but he does he", "55:59", "gets shark eyes he gets he's black like", "56:01", "soulless eyes where he's gone", "56:04", "and you go oh no he's gone yeah it's", "56:06", "weird but I wonder what that is I feel", "56:09", "like that's a neurological issue I feel", "56:11", "like if alcohol does that to you there's", "56:13", "probably like some switches that aren't", "56:15", "connected right in the head I'd imagine", "56:17", "there's something going on yeah mmm yeah", "56:19", "so Teddy Kennedy who knows I mean he was", "56:21", "obviously a raging alcoholic and that", "56:23", "could have been a part of the problem I", "56:26", "mean literally might have gone home not", "56:27", "even knowing that he killed somebody I", "56:29", "mean that'd have to be his only defense", "56:31", "yeah you'd imagine well that was one of", "56:34", "the things that they said they would",

not universally on", "132:08", "average then it seems to me that it's", "132:11", "easier to just say that the climate", "132:13", "changes over time and maybe cities that", "132:15", "are on the

like a", "132:53", "mechanical engineering degree yeah kind", "132:55", "of a comedian yeah I mean I think he is", "132:57", "my childhood yes I believe he was like a", "133:00", "comedian he's a stand-up guy yeah yeah", "133:02", "and he does you ever see is this thing", "133:05", "with Tucker Carl", "133:06", "which was great", "133:08", "Tucker Carlson kept saying okay but", "133:09", "you're talking about science so tell me", "133:11", "how much of an effect do human beings", "133:14", "have on climate change and what what is", "133:17", "what's the science", "133:18", "Chimay and all he wanted to say was that", "133:21", "you know are you a consensus settle yeah", "133:23", "exactly and like what is what is the", "133:25", "difference or it's changing right give", "133:27",

these", "133:40", "catastrophic scenarios where it looks", "133:41", "like the day after tomorrow and Dennis", "133:43", "Quaid running into subways and shit", "133:45", "weirder ones he said was that we were", "133:47", "supposed to have an ice age now that's", "133:49", "not gonna happen like Jesus Christ man", "133:51", "that's good yeah you know Randall", "133:53", "Carlson has been on my podcast a few", "133:54", "times and he's an expert in collisions", "133:57", "and asteroid collisions and one of the", "133:59", "things he said is like he goes global", "134:00", "warming is not great he goes but it's", "134:03", "way better than global cooling this is", "134:05", "true cooling kills ever there right", "134:08", "though the Little Ice Age was not a good", "134:10", "thing for the world I mean the global", "134:12", "warm period was actually a pretty good", "134:13", "thing for the world so I mean this is", "134:15", "this is the other thing is that there", "134:16", "are costs and benefits to the climate", "134:17", "changing which would hit which it has", "134:18", "throughout time right what are we", "134:20", "willing to sacrifice in order to prevent", "134:22",

"134:36", "the sea absorption of emissions right", "134:38", "now like the toxification of the oceans", "134:40", "like that seems to me to be a bigger", "134:41", "problem than the climate changing over", "134:43", "time we're pretty adaptable like there's", "134:46", "a lot of land okay so we move we have", "134:50", "historically right I mean Venice the the", "134:52", "sea-level rise in Venice every year", "134:53", "people are going to move I mean like", "134:54", "that's just that's the way it works I am", "134:56", "absolutely there's this weird idea and", "134:58", "it's it's true in economics it's true", "134:59", "with global warming that where you were", "135:01", "born is where you must die hmm", "135:03", "right and then you can never move and", "135:04", "it's like well this is the most mobile", "135:05", "society in human history we were on a", "135:08", "plane and be on the other coast in six", "135:09", "hours it's it's easier to move than ever", "135:11",

really sure", "135:32", "that that would have worked that way one", "135:34", "way or another the it has been", "135:36", "absolutely proven that human beings are", "135:39", "having an effect on this carbon dioxide", "135:41", "levels of course of course yeah there's", "135:43", "a greenhouse gas effect sure a hundred", "135:45", "percent so modeling's been so wrong that", "135:48", "like I want there's no level of", "135:51", "certitude and then there's no level of", "135:52", "solution that I know for sure is going", "135:54", "to do this so you're talking about human", "135:56", "being suffering in the now for the later", "135:58", "and let's be real about this like yes", "136:00", "there are a lot of emissions from the", "136:01", "United States but the leading emitter is", "136:02", "on the planet right now we're trying in", "136:03", "India and they're not gonna stop this", "136:05", "Russian anytime soon like that's not", "136:07", "gonna happen well there's also this", "136:08", "thing that happens where if you even", "136:10", "discuss it you become like a Hitler or a", "136:13", "Nazi you become a climate change denier", "136:16", "and once you get locked into one of", "136:18", "those labels you know you you're a piece", "136:20", "of shit well this is and yeah nobody", "136:22", "wants to be locked into those labels so", "136:24", "they don't want to have the discussion", "136:26", "of the debate and that's one of the", "136:27", "things that I felt like Bill Nye was not", "136:30", "prepared for because I felt like he's so", "136:32", "lazy with this conversation because so", "136:34", "many people just appease him and agree", "136:35", "with it yeah I think that's when Tucker", "136:36", "Carlson was challenging him on it he", "136:39",

"136:49", "there was one time when when they had", "136:51", "some guy on who was saying exactly what", "136:54", "we were saying that the models did they", "136:57", "have not been proven to be accurate and", "136:58", "that Al Gore's movie predicted that we'd", "137:00", "be underwater in 2014 he didn't it yeah", "137:04", "I mean his predictions in that movie or", "137:05", "not correct yeah they're not correct at", "137:06", "all whoo and he's made like some insane", "137:08", "amount of money he's gonna sequel out", "137:11", "this week isn't he like the first", "137:12", "billion

them", "137:31", "they're not even open to debate or Chris", "137:34", "they they become locked down and when", "137:37", "tucker carlson was pressing bill not", "137:40", "like what is what are the numbers like", "137:42", "what is happening tell me how much of an", "137:44", "effect are we having and Bill Nye had", "137:46", "nothing on it and became stammered and", "137:49", "started getting angry is like wow this", "137:51", "is weird", "137:52", "yeah this is weird to see I mean if this", "137:54", "is the cause of your life you should", "137:55", "know a little bit more about it then", "137:56", "everyone who disagrees is a denier and I", "137:58", "think the way Tucker handled it was", "137:59", "brilliant Tucker's best moment I think", "138:01", "on a show yeah I think so too because he", "138:03", "was saying essentially he was like I'm", "138:05", "not denying it I'm not saying aside I", "138:07", "just want you to tell me but the effect", "138:09", "tell me he'll be hanged and he had", "138:10", "nothing it's like so maybe Bill Nyes the", "138:13", "wrong guy to have their I shouldn't be", "138:15", "selling himself like you can't have me", "138:17", "come on a fucking show and talk about", "138:19", "plot global warming because I don't know", "138:21", "anything right or at the very least", "138:22", "Bill Nye should say listen the you know", "138:24",

their", "138:38", "prep for debate or for TV appearances", "138:41", "like because the truth is you think", "138:42", "you're gonna be on for fight having done", "138:44", "a thousand TV heads at this point most", "138:46", "people think ok I'm beyond for five", "138:47", "minutes I can get through five minutes", "138:48", "right I'm gonna be that bad if I'm on", "138:50", "for 10 minutes how bad can it be", "138:51", "and the answer is you can get pantsed on", "138:53", "national TV in five minutes if the", "138:55", "person knows what they're doing well", "138:56", "you've done that too many people one of", "138:57", "the things that I think is do you talk", "138:59", "fast always you're born this way", "139:02", "everyone my family talks the family just", "139:04", "talks from me as I

way but yeah even even my kids", "139:15", "don't talk this way even the", "139:16", "three-year-old to see some people that", "139:18", "are just really good at Baba Baba and", "139:21", "you you get them in the podcast and", "139:23", "after like Peter shifts a great example", "139:24", "after like 20 minutes I'm like you want", "139:26", "a drink let's have some whiskey I had a", "139:28", "couple of glasses of Clank", "139:29", "cheers and we settled down and then he", "139:31", "settled into like a normal way of", "139:32", "talking but he's just so used to like", "139:34", "force feeding you fats and pans and it's", "139:39", "just it's such an ineffective way to", "139:40", "communicate with those three heads and", "139:42", "the the one person who is the host throw",

"144:51", "if you can find that I think there's a", "144:53", "website dedicated to that that people", "144:55", "but there's a lot of cancer just living", "144:58", "in cities man like they say that one of", "145:00", "the worst environments for human beings", "145:02", "living in a place that has a lot of", "145:03", "brake dust like if you're living in", "145:05", "Manhattan and you get your

these people this", "145:17", "is from 2000s sometimes the statistics", "145:19", "on cancer are hard to correlate right is", "145:21", "it because you'll have groupings that", "145:23", "are sort of weird and that's just", "145:24", "because random statistical grouping yeah", "145:26", "so how much of it is due to X Factor or", "145:29", "Y factor if we do that then presumably", "145:31", "the cancer race would be going down a", "145:32", "lot you know they haven't really in most", "145:34", "cases so it's pretty rare you have like", "145:36", "a lung cancer situation where smoking",

I've been", "145:54", "flying into the valley my entire life", "145:56", "and every time you fly into the brown", "145:58", "gunk soup that is that is the valley", "146:00", "atmosphere you think that's not great", "146:02", "yeah you mean that is one area where", "146:03", "obviously we have gotten better I mean", "146:04", "the smog alerts have gone down", "146:06", "tremendously in the last 30 years yeah", "146:07", "it's gotten a lot better it's gotten a", "146:09", "lot better and but that's also one of", "146:11", "the things that Donald Trump has relaxed", "146:13", "some of the standards the kind of", "146:17", "standards wasn't I don't know the", "146:19", "mission standards he changed the car", "146:21", "emission standards maybe it's again I", "146:24", "wonder how much of the car emission", "146:25", "standards like there's there's actually", "146:27", "thriving debate and libertarian", "146:29", "community particularly about whether", "146:30", "cave standards are

Prius", "146:45", "well the Prius thing is interesting too", "146:47", "it particularly the Tesla thing because", "146:49", "then you look at the environmental", "146:50", "disasters of creating these batteries", "146:52", "yes and you're like oh this is not", "146:53", "totally green yeah like there's some", "146:56", "weird gray area too it's pretty complex", "146:59", "and and I think that the one thing we", "147:01", "know is that there are millions of", "147:02", "people all over the world for all of", "147:04", "human history who have been living in", "147:05", "absolute penury and misery and we now", "147:07", "support 7 billion people on the planet", "147:08", "and the rate of global poverty has", "147:11", "dropped by 50% in the last 30 years a", "147:13", "lot of that is technological change a", "147:14", "lot of that is fossil fuel use and so", "147:16", "before we you know we always have to ban", "147:19", "these are two things that are worth", "147:20", "thinking about balancing like and this", "147:22", "is what's again a little frustrating is", "147:24", "that sometimes you see people on the", "147:25", "environmental left will say well this", "147:27", "has to be done or it's the end of the", "147:29", "world and so well how about those people", "147:30", "in developing countries how many of", "147:31", "those people you're gonna say have to", "147:32", "live in poverty in order for this to", "147:34", "happen right and then on the right", "147:35", "you'll see people say well no", "147:37", "environmental regulations at all just", "147:38", "let it all hang out and you know", "147:41", "sometimes the market hashes it out and", "147:43", "sometimes the market doesn't hash it out", "147:44", "and so you know I think a little caution", "147:46", "is warranted I think that's a very", "147:48", "reasonable point of view and that's one", "147:50", "of the things that I really like about", "147:51", "your commentary I know you're a", "147:52",

a", "153:03", "horrible thing had happened to her it", "153:04", "was much more about as a journalistic", "153:07", "entity do you stand by Europe", "153:08", "or do you stand by the candidate who you", "153:10", "support and once Breitbart made clear to", "153:13", "me that it like I already knew they", "153:15", "supported Trump that was in a great", "153:16", "shock but I was kind of their
