to", "24:12", "climate data those are the ones that", "24:14", "always pushing whether they're right or", "24:15", "wrong or getting the right data they're", "24:17", "the ones that are really harping

more left professors and", "24:29", "they're all right", "24:30", "so you would think okay you have this", "24:31", "like base of academia and knowledge on", "24:33", "the left but yet the left is the side", "24:37", "that's willing to entertain the idea", "24:39", "that a young kid should take hormones to", "24:42", "alter their sex when you know for a", "24:45", "fucking fact that when you're a young", "24:47", "person you're extremely confused", "24:49", "constantly back and forth left and right", "24:51", "there are hormonal changes the cerebral", "24:54", "cortex of frontal cortex doesn't

I", "25:04", "said right it's a lot of people", "25:07", "listening that are 20 and retarded that", "25:09", "like what the fuck am I doing with my", "25:10", "life exactly dude you're barely an adult", "25:12", "oh you think about things you do it like", "25:14", "22 and you're like I can't believe I'm", "25:15", "saying he's on the same aren't human but", "25:18", "so this same party the same progressive", "25:21", "mindset that is so incredibly", "25:23", "open-minded but yet also so deeply", "25:26", "embedded in academia like far more than", "25:28", "the right is this is the side that is", "25:31", "willing to put aside all that they know", "25:33", "about biology and psychology and", "25:36", "physiology and children put aside that a", "25:40", "lot of people are not all of them not on", "25:41", "one lung but anybody the other put aside", "25:43", "that for progressive brownie points for", "25:46", "saying that you are so incredibly open", "25:48", "like this child obviously knows right he", "25:50", "is a she or she is a he and we need to", "25:53", "start addressing them as that and this", "25:54", "is just a fact well it's not just a fact", "25:57", "it's a conversation that we should have", "25:59", "and I think it varies in individuals and", "26:01", "I think there are some people that I", "26:02", "have personally talked to that are", "26:03", "transgender people that for sure are", "26:05", "happier being a woman or a man and they", "26:08", "were born in what they feel is the wrong", "26:10", "body and I absolutely 100% salute their",

"26:22", "sickle issue how many people is there a", "26:25", "physical trait that we're missing is", "26:27", "there some some switch that gets flipped", "26:30", "when they're young I mean it's a", "26:31", "fascinating aspect of human beings that", "26:33", "you are one sex and wish you were", "26:35", "another right and it seems strange to me", "26:37", "that on the left the rules always seem", "26:40", "to be there's this topic like it's like", "26:42", "the left thing forever it's always like", "26:44", "we need to have a national conversation", "26:46", "about race right but if you say the", "26:48", "wrong thing I want you ruined yeah you", "26:50", "know and it's the same thing with like", "26:51", "the transgender thing it's like they", "26:52", "want to like it's like we want to have a", "26:54", "conversation about this they put this", "26:55", "forward as like this is an issue we need", "26:57", "to talk about and then also by the way", "26:58", "you're not allowed to say anything so if", "27:00", "you bring up the 40% suicide rate and", "27:02", "say maybe this isn't due to societal", "27:03", "oppression because there's no real link", "27:05", "between societal oppression and high", "27:06", "suicide rates but now you need to be", "27:08", "fired or something but they say 40% of", "27:11", "transgender people commit suicide and", "27:13", "the people that want to support the idea", "27:15", "that there's it's not of any sort of a", "27:17", "mental illness in any people and sure", "27:19", "it's not in some we're not generalizing", "27:21", "but it must be in some right the people", "27:23", "that want to deny that say the reason", "27:25", "why they're suicidal is because they", "27:28", "don't get a chance to express their", "27:30", "genuine authentic self which is a very", "27:33", "good point so it's not it's not that", "27:35", "either or no I'm open to the argument", "27:36", "but it's like the argument that the 40%", "27:39", "is possibly it's maybe a combination of", "27:42", "those two factors maybe there's some", "27:43", "people that are mentally ill that are", "27:45", "suicidal in the first place and they", "27:46", "hope that maybe becoming a woman would", "27:48", "make them feel better and it didn't work", "27:49", "out there's there's a whole website", "27:51", "where people how I think it's called", "27:54", "transgender regret or something like", "27:55", "that and it's all people that switched", "27:56", "over and we're like really upset that", "27:58", "they did it and then realized it was",

way", "28:08", "and people just constantly shit on them", "28:10", "and bully them and and heckle them and", "28:12", "and they that's what's causing them to", "28:15", "be so deeply it's not like one or the", "28:18", "other no and I think in every individual", "28:19", "case there's probably like a complex you", "28:21", "know a complex set of you know different", "28:24", "cause causing factors you know it's so", "28:26", "yeah I agree with that I just think it's", "28:28", "like no matter how look obviously I'm", "28:30", "Thor you know like everyone owns their", "28:32", "own body and

into it they've just been told", "29:51", "this is the science and they're like oh", "29:52", "great now I get to bash people by having", "29:54", "the science because if you're gonna say", "29:56",

sure", "72:07", "short right they were worried about that", "72:09", "although I gotta say the EPA thing I", "72:12", "don't think any of this is actually the", "72:13", "source of the Trump hatred I think this", "72:15", "is like we hate Trump and now what's he", "72:17", "doing there's no evidence so we go we're", "72:19", "going to get evidence against him the", "72:21", "truth is what they'll say nine out of", "72:23", "ten times if I present this to a", "72:24", "left-wing person or I'll go like you", "72:25", "know he's pretty much continuing all the", "72:26", "Obama policies or it's you know", "72:28", "virtually the same which i think is one", "72:30", "of the really big stories of the Trump", "72:32", "era so far that how much is the same", "72:34", "since Obama no one wanted

are down", "73:22", "right under Trump there were more under", "73:24", "Obama I mean they're down now there's a", "73:27", "few different arguments for why that", "73:28", "reason is there have been a lot of", "73:30", "arrests but but not deportations but", "73:33", "it's just like even that the narrative", "73:35", "isn't fitting the way like what really", "73:38", "to me what really drove what made people", "73:42", "hate Trump was his rhetoric it was all", "73:44", "rhetoric", "73:44", "it wasn't Obama was deporting lots of", "73:46", "people Obama was bombing the crap out of", "73:48",

things about minorities", "74:16", "when asked but his central message was", "74:17", "like our team's great and this to me is", "74:20", "I think the reason why left-wing", "74:22", "people's blood boil well just so many", "74:25", "pieces of evidence a point to corruption", "74:27", "with Russia so many pieces of evidence", "74:29", "that point to the idea that this guy is", "74:32", "operating

they", "96:59", "would throw a kick like I got a book", "97:01", "when I was a kid about Taekwondo", "97:02", "techniques and this one old dude would", "97:05", "practice in the park by kicking trees", "97:07", "and the way he would kick trees is with", "97:09", "the ball of his foot", "97:10", "you throw a roundhouse kick and kick the", "97:12", "ball of his foot into the tree and it", "97:15", "was what it was really funny book", "97:16", "because in one one of the things where", "97:18", "he described all various self-defense", "97:20", "techniques he described what to do if",

a classic japanese martial art", "98:20", "striker that's that's him right there", "98:21", "okay and you got to think by the time", "98:24", "these guys got to the UFC they had been", "98:26",

do", "98:50", "this more than one time in a day but", "98:52", "that was what they did in Pride a lot", "98:54", "oh he just threw him off the top of the", "98:56", "mat in Pride they would fight several", "98:57", "times a day yeah early ufc's as well and", "99:00", "then it like eventually I think they", "99:01", "started realizing like a lot of guys get", "99:03", "injured doing this the craziest ideas", "99:05", "like that stupid movie warrior when they", "99:07", "fought more than one time in a week like", "99:09", "they fought once and they fought again", "99:11", "the next day that's got to be worse than", "99:12", "the same day probably because you're", "99:14", "like yeah all the soreness that like", "99:15", "comes in two days later your fucking", "99:17", "face is all swollen you can't see if two", "99:19", "sunglasses everywhere and you definitely", "99:21", "can't take a punch like the whole idea", "99:22", "is so stupid and they don't do that I", "99:24", "mean maybe they've done that a couple of", "99:26", "times throughout history but that's not", "99:28", "a standard thing in this movie warrior", "99:30", "they just added their own Hollywood jizz", "99:32", "to the soup like let me just change it", "99:34", "you're gonna fight for the face brother", "99:36", "in an image", "99:38", "grab my balls that's what they did they", "99:42", "added their own stupidity to it just", "99:44", "didn't even make any sense and it was", "99:45", "totally unnecessary like that that's you", "99:48", "can't you're changing what martial arts", "99:51", "are just to fit your narrative yeah", "99:52", "because you're not a good writer like if", "99:54", "you if you were a good writer you would", "99:57", "write about how it actually happens and", "99:59", "you'd make a story about how it actually", "100:01", "happens you wouldn't create some fake", "100:03", "thing that you can do something that", "100:04", "could be real yeah several times in a", "100:07", "day twice two days in a row you'd be", "100:09", "fucking me well it's like just just give", "100:12", "him like superpowers at this point just", "100:13", "give him like ha dude games and stuff if", "100:15", "you're gonna decide what you are are you", "100:18", "an excellent dramatic movie with Nick", "100:20", "Nolte and Tom what the fuck's his name", "100:23", "who's the other guy the fuck his name no", "100:25", "no no no how dare you the young guy", "100:27", "who's Bane Tom Hardy Tom Hardy that", "100:30", "motherfucker is amazing right it's him", "100:33", "and Nick Nolte I mean they're amazing", "100:34", "but yet they put in this stupid plot", "100:36", "idea where they have to fight in two", "100:37", "days oh yeah I'm on just come on it's", "100:40", "like I it's annoying because it's like", "100:42", "you're making this world real and then", "100:44", "you're doing something that's like just", "100:45", "my little ridiculous yeah and it makes", "100:51", "it impossible for someone like you to", "100:52", "enjoy it's like if anyone who knows", "100:54", "fighting Canada which by the way I will", "100:56", "say and I do even when we talk about", "100:57", "old-school UFC there's something like", "100:59", "that like I'm nostalgic for it I know", "101:00", "you can't have it now it has to be the", "101:02", "sport it is now and it's evolved way", "101:04", "past there but there was just something", "101:05", "so cool about the old UFC right and", "101:07", "there was something about the Conor", "101:09", "verse fight that almost gave you that", "101:12", "feeling again yeah like these two guys", "101:14", "from different worlds going in there and", "101:16", "like how does this look like how does", "101:18", "the guy he was doing MMA striking and", "101:20", "fucking doing like a plate of stuff on", "101:22", "the side how does he go in there and box", "101:24", "and then it turned out Conor actually", "101:25", "was just like I know you got a box can't", "101:27", "do any of that stuff you get destroyed", "101:28", "so I just went out there and boxed and", "101:30", "but it wasn't interesting like I came", "101:32", "out of it", "101:32", "I was arguing a lot of friends of mine", "101:33", "who were like big boxing fans and", "101:35", "nothing against you guys", "101:36", "god bless boxing I'm not like as big a", "101:39", "fan as I used to be I'm a huge MMA fan", "101:41", "but I just can't like when you look at", "101:43", "MMA the way you look at MMA is like the", "101:45", "sport of fighting and and the original", "101:47", "thing was always figuring out who's", "101:48", "better at fighting and having these", "101:49", "it was just hard for me to not look at", "101:51", "the fight with Conor and and and Floyd", "101:56", "and go like you know it's like when", "101:57", "there was the first clinch at Lewis J", "101:59", "Gomez said this to me is the first", "102:01", "clinch of the fight he goes well that's", "102:03", "where Connor would destroy him yeah and", "102:05", "then you just sit there watching ten", "102:06", "rounds of a referee saving Floyd", "102:09", "Mayweather's life like every few seconds", "102:12", "the referee comes in and goes oh let me", "102:13", "save your life no let me save your life", "102:15", "I don't you're the greatest ever at this", "102:16", "but you need even under your rules with", "102:18", "your gloves and your this you need a ref", "102:20", "to keep coming in and saving your life", "102:22", "every few seconds and you'd see it like", "102:24", "every time they they clinch like Connor", "102:26", "would immediately almost just", "102:27", "instinctually just like kind of take his", "102:29", "back and like step over here you know", "102:31", "cuz right here is where I can hit you", "102:32", "and you can't avoid would just cover up", "102:34", "and bend over yep like literally bend", "102:36", "over like a guy come save my life buddy", "102:37", "yeah and it's just hard like to not", "102:39", "watch letting go oh if he wanted to he", "102:41", "would jump on his back and choke him to", "102:43", "death and even even in your sport like", "102:46", "he went ten rounds and okay I know", "102:48", "Mayweather I know what Mayweather did", "102:50", "was brilliant and he dragged a man he", "102:51", "played it safe and perfectly but it", "102:53", "wasn't a part of the plan to eat that", "102:55", "uppercut on the chin that definitely", "102:56", "wasn't a part of the plan and and and", "102:58", "also I think there's boxers punch a lot", "103:00", "harder than MMA guys do and there's", "103:01", "there's truth to that too so Conor's", "103:03", "power didn't translate in the way that", "103:05", "MMA fans thought it would he's just not", "103:07", "quite as fluid and also I think he's", "103:09", "probably very nervous I mean he's", "103:11", "fighting literally the greatest fighter", "103:13", "of all time in his first professional", "103:15", "boxing session it's so crazy and yet he", "103:18", "still got it through the 10th round if", "103:20", "Floyd I mean I this is why I said I said", "103:22", "I gave Conor", "103:24", "of winning a boxing match very small so", "103:27", "I thought it was like 94% that Floyd", "103:29", "would beat the shit out of Conor the way", "103:31", "he did and that Conor would eventually", "103:33", "like get tired like the guy who did the", "103:35", "best assessment of it in my opinion was", "103:37", "John Danaher John Danaher who's a", "103:40", "brilliant jiu-jitsu coach is also a", "103:42", "brilliant MMA coach kids get a deep", "103:43", "understanding of it he basically spelled", "103:45", "out exactly what's gonna happen because", "103:46", "of all the times he's seen a boxers", "103:48", "sparring with elite martial artists that", "103:51", "the mixed martial arts does well for a", "103:53", "few rounds because it takes a while for", "103:55", "the boxer to figure out the timing and", "103:56", "then the efficiency and fluidity of the", "103:59", "boxer starts to take over the reign", "104:01", "generalship the understanding of this", "104:02", "one isolated particular", "104:04", "discipline and then they dominate and", "104:05", "that's exactly what happened to a tee", "104:07", "what I said is I think there's a 94%", "104:10", "chance that Floyd Mayweather just boxes", "104:13", "the shit out of Conor McGregor there is", "104:15", "a four percent chance that Conor catches", "104:17", "him with like an uppercut like he did in", "104:19", "the first round and actually stuns him", "104:20", "and hurts them and then swarms on him", "104:22", "and takes him out Conor's got ferocious", "104:25", "power it's whether or not he executed", "104:27", "that power like he has an MMA whether he", "104:29", "felt he could drain his gas tank like", "104:30", "that", "104:31", "especially with two months worth of", "104:32", "training not enough not enough to get in", "104:34", "shape for a 12-round boxing match", "104:36", "against the greatest of all time but", "104:37", "there was a 100% chance that Conor nukes", "104:41", "him in a fucking MMA fight nukes him", "104:44", "like I would yeah I'd be willing", "104:46", "literally 100 I cuz Floyd's not gonna", "104:48", "knock him out with one punch and Conor", "104:50", "could kick his fucking legs out from", "104:51", "under him before he got even close", "104:52", "enough to punch him and if they did get", "104:54", "to a clinch which they absolutely would", "104:56", "Connor would ragdoll him to the ground", "104:58", "and beat his fucking brains in before he", "105:00", "strangled them on 1% like 100 percent", "105:02", "even if you just look if you just take", "105:04", "out even grappling I agree with you that", "105:06", "I just thought as a master of range and", "105:08", "he's got excellent kicks and he can kick", "105:09", "the shit out of him and stay out of the", "105:11", "area where he's you know just stay out", "105:12", "of his punching range and kick him in", "105:14", "the legs on the body you can clinch if", "105:16", "you don't break him up when he doesn't", "105:17", "get oh nice the body done fucked yeah", "105:20", "you're fucked in elbows to the head he's", "105:21", "gonna tie you up the back of the head", "105:23", "and smash you", "105:24", "does that ever happened no never you", "105:26", "don't know what the fuck to do when the", "105:27", "guys doing that you don't know how to", "105:28", "deal with those knees to the face like", "105:30", "when Anderson Silva fucked up Rich", "105:31", "Franklin to win the title when he just", "105:33", "plumb the back of his head and just", "105:34", "start smashing knees in his face and he", "105:36", "was clear that rich really didn't know", "105:37", "he didn't have an answer to that yeah", "105:39", "which was an amazing thing because that", "105:41", "was one of those moments like everyone", "105:42", "in the MMA world thought rich was the", "105:44", "best or not MMA world everyone in the", "105:45", "UFC world kind of like thought was the", "105:48", "best but I mean because your that's why", "105:50", "I correct myself because people who knew", "105:51", "the MMA scene better and pride and that", "105:53", "stuff knew what Anderson Silva was but", "105:54", "like the average fan of the UFC had just", "105:57", "been we hadn't really seen Anderson", "105:59", "Silva I had seen one or two tapes of him", "106:01", "pride and I'd say I saw him like maybe", "106:03", "dump rats on the one where he got ankle", "106:04", "ankle locked real quick so I don't", "106:07", "really know how good Anderson Silva was", "106:08", "I saw I'd seen him beat Carlos Newton", "106:10", "and that was like all I had on him I was", "106:12", "like I'm Rich Franklin I'll probably", "106:13", "well the pride fights the thing was when", "106:16", "he", "106:17", "out of pride and then fighting in cage", "106:19", "wars for cage warrior what the fuck was", "106:21", "that English I remember the one you're", "106:23", "talking about no that's an English", "106:26", "organization god damn it I want to say", "106:29", "cage wars but it's not that cage warrior", "106:31", "hmm the fuck do they call anyway he went", "106:34", "over there and just started fucking", "106:35", "Buchan people so like I didn't seen any", "106:37", "of that yeah I'd seen any of that and I", "106:38", "think I guess most UFC fans hadn't seen", "106:41", "that either and they saw Rich Franklin", "106:42", "is the champ", "106:43", "yeah I'd beat up a bunch of guys the", "106:45", "odds were actually in Anderson's favor", "106:47", "though Oh were they yeah it's one of the", "106:49", "weird ones where the oddsmakers when he", "106:51", "fought Chris Leben he was a slight", "106:53", "favorite his first UFC fight and I was", "106:55", "like get ready for some crazy shit", "106:57", "because this motherfuckers on a totally", "106:59", "different level I'm like I knew him I'd", "107:01", "seen him fight Jorge Rivera and leemarie", "107:04", "I saw him hit Tony Ferguson with a step", "107:06", "in upper cut elbow that his Brown he'd", "107:08", "practice on a pillow at home", "107:10", "he made his wife hold a pillow and", "107:12", "practice his technique because he wanted", "107:14", "to use it in his fights and his coaches", "107:15", "wouldn't hold the pads for him because", "107:16", "they thought it was ridiculous and they", "107:17", "said is this true I think I remember", "107:19", "hearing this but I think it was like in", "107:20", "between rounds he said to one of his", "107:21", "coach he goes I think it's open I think", "107:23", "it's them they're like forget about the", "107:24", "stupid technique dammit like it's not", "107:26", "gonna be there I don't know if that's", "107:27", "the case might be wrong about that I", "107:29", "fucked up Tony Ferguson before that the", "107:30", "reason why I was able to get that off is", "107:32", "because he wasn't turned 21st excuse me", "107:34", "um Tony Frick 'ln Tony Frick lanai yes", "107:37", "yes", "107:37", "my apologies 21st he fought Tony", "107:40", "freaking he hit him with the standing", "107:42", "stepping in uppercut with the elbow and", "107:45", "he was like another level maybe three", "107:48", "four five levels above fricking at the", "107:51", "time yeah just so in fricking was a real", "107:53", "veteran Brooklyn was in one of the first", "107:55", "ufc's that I ever worked in 1997 he was", "107:59", "there and so that was like his debut in", "108:02", "the UFC I was there when he had his", "108:04", "debut so Anderson was just lighting him", "108:06", "on fire before he decided step in an", "108:08", "uppercut him but I just knew he was on", "108:10", "it's just such a different level but", "108:12", "that was a really important learning", "108:14", "moment for MMA cuz people knew like okay", "108:17", "if you get in a fight and a guy is a", "108:19", "more Thai practitioner on the level of", "108:21", "Anderson Silva you better learn how to", "108:23", "deal with this goddamn clinch here's", "108:26", "Anderson versus Tony Franklin and this", "108:29", "is Anderson", "108:30", "in my opinion maybe his prime ever", "108:33", "because he hadn't taken on all the", "108:35", "damage and all the crazy fights that he", "108:37", "had in the UFC and but by the time he", "108:39", "got to

quickly", "112:25", "like I mean it was it wasn't too long", "112:26", "before like Dan Severn and Mark Coleman", "112:28", "and guys like that who had like legit", "112:30", "wrestling credits came

first yeah go back to", "112:43", "that go back to that fight again here's", "112:45", "something that's interesting to point at", "112:46", "is bas Rutten was one of the early guys", "112:48", "to Victor Maurice there weren't too many", "112:51", "besides that like it", "112:52", "those guys were like a few who actually", "112:54", "because it took so much to learn all the", "112:56", "other shit right", "112:57", "the difference team boss and Maurice was", "112:59", "that Maurice is more of a tactician and", "113:01", "boss was a destroyer", "113:02", "he was like an intelligent animal he", "113:04", "would just like attack like vicious", "113:06", "ferocious striking you know but real", "113:09", "aggressive but also very technical as", "113:11", "well whereas Maurice is much more clever", "113:13", "like leg kick dependent like Maurice is", "113:16", "actually on a higher level in terms of", "113:18", "like professional kickboxing than boss", "113:19", "bas didn't have like a lot of kickboxing", "113:21", "fights", "113:22", "Maurice was a world champion okay boss", "113:24", "had that Holland style and as an MMA", "113:27", "fighter he was like one of the first", "113:28", "guys we ever saw that could kick so", "113:30", "fucking hard but if you if you watch", "113:32", "this fight what you learn is like what", "113:34", "Conor McGregor figured out what Conor", "113:36", "McGregor figured out is that what holds", "113:38", "a lot of these guys back is movement and", "113:40", "see if you look at Tony fricken as he's", "113:41", "moving towards Anderson his movement", "113:44", "he's very limited like he can't he can't", "113:46", "cover distance quick enough he has to", "113:47", "make these little hop steps hop steps", "113:49", "right just slide in and blast things", "113:52", "Conor is fluid with his movement in and", "113:55", "out to the point where he can step", "113:57", "forward and obviously wouldn't be able", "113:59", "to do that with Anderson Silva but he", "114:01", "can step forward and step in and step", "114:03", "out like when he fought Jose Aldo one of", "114:06", "the most important parts of that fight", "114:08", "was that Aldo was trying to figure out", "114:10", "the movement of Conor like go to go to", "114:12", "that fight Jose Aldo vs Conor McGregor", "114:14", "and what what Conor was doing so good", "114:16", "was sliding forward and sliding back", "114:19", "there's like that one moment it cuz it's", "114:21", "a very short fight but there's the one", "114:22", "moment where he like faints a thing and", "114:24", "jumps back right here see yeah yeah see", "114:26", "how happy but look how like he's in and", "114:30", "out he's moving a lot and it's it's a", "114:33", "different thing boom slides back and", "114:35", "drops the fucking left hammer on his", "114:37", "chin and it's that movement that's so", "114:39", "critical in a really high level look how", "114:42", "fluid its back and launches that punch", "114:44", "at the same time it's very interesting", "114:46", "to me too because it was a different", "114:47", "intensity in his movement than like when", "114:49", "he fought other guys like Chad Mendes", "114:51", "another because he respected what Aldo", "114:53", "throws Aldo throws heat and especially", "114:55", "in that first round when Aldo's furious", "114:57", "at you for disrespecting him out like he", "114:59", "knows he's coming with like a bomb but", "115:02", "yeah just but it's superior movement", "115:04", "it's also new unorthodox movement boom I", "115:08", "mean a lot of ways they've been doing", "115:10", "that shit", "115:11", "karate tournaments forever right but", "115:13", "people hadn't figured it out in MMA yet", "115:15", "I mean if you look at a lot of what", "115:17", "Connor had done with his stance and his", "115:19", "movement a lot of it resembles what you", "115:21", "see in the karate point tournaments when", "115:23", "they would leap in and drop a shot on", "115:24", "you and leap out but they weren't", "115:26", "fighting stationary people like although", "115:28", "they just charge forward but although", "115:30", "got used to fighting in that man yeah", "115:32", "fighting more time yeah isn't that kind", "115:34", "of MMA look at the wrestling look you", "115:37", "know it's really fascinating to me just", "115:38", "aren't this kind of evolution was a god", "115:41", "what's his name us so who know the the", "115:44", "guy fought to mitra fights like him yeah", "115:47", "now suddenly adopted this style and", "115:49", "you're like holy shit this style gives", "115:51", "people real problems I'm a man and it's", "115:54", "like I get I mean maybe I'm wrong about", "115:56", "this but it reminds me a little bit of", "115:58", "almost like Machida type thing like but", "116:00", "it's like this it's this weird karate", "116:02", "kind of thing that it's like this weird", "116:05", "evolution wake once you have all the", "116:07", "other shit and what Connor does is he's", "116:08", "also got really good traditional boxing", "116:10", "so like like not a lot of MMA guys", "116:12", "couldn't do 10 rounds with Mayweather", "116:14", "there yeah you know like it's he's also", "116:15", "got boxing so he can kind of mix it up", "116:18", "with like traditional boxing attacks and", "116:20", "this crazy other shit so it's crazy", "116:22", "about him as he'll be like throwing like", "116:23", "like these crazy spinning like cartwheel", "116:27", "kicks and then he'll just have like a", "116:28", "one-two that was like perfect mm-hmm", "116:30", "which that's new to MMA we haven't seen", "116:32", "a lot of that in the past then you know", "116:34", "it's those kicks are longer too you're", "116:37", "dealing with something that reaches much", "116:39", "further than the traditional Muay Thai", "116:41", "techniques or or straight boxing",

"117:17", "him yeah but that was like at least to", "117:19", "me like a little like glimpse of like oh", "117:21", "well maybe if this guy is this good a", "117:23", "grappler and is figuring striking out", "117:24", "like that", "117:25", "maybe he's the guy who could you know", "117:26", "like be a good a good contender it may", "117:28", "may happen very well I mean he might", "117:30",

like what George st.

"well he was always coming off injuries", "119:33", "by that as a problem but the real", "119:35", "problem the Fabricio Werdum fight was", "119:37", "that he didn't prepare in Mex", "119:38", "city goes Mexico cities at 7500 feet", "119:41", "above sea level which is where I was in", "119:43", "Utah last week I couldn't imagine if you", "119:46", "didn't train there that you could be", "119:48",

now", "120:27", "I'll be fine with that and it didn't", "120:29", "work out okay but I'll say and I know", "120:31", "he's an injury case but like the Cain", "120:33", "Velasquez that showed up to UFC
