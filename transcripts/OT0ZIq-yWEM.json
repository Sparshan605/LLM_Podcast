as credible as it gets well look", "31:23", "at that cool-looking dog there it is", "31:25", "what a freaky looking - the world's", "31:26", "rarest and most ancient dog has been", "31:28",

"they are has there been a concerted", "31:39", "effort to find these things sort of I", "31:42", "mean it's it's one of those things where", "31:43", "like I would say the thylacine is like", "31:45", "the icon of animals coming back from", "31:47", "extinction for Australia right it's kind", "31:49", "of like everybody knows about in", "31:51", "Australia they're all care about it but",

into", "32:01", "look for them hmm and that's what I did", "32:03", "so there's so much belief that the", "32:05", "animal is still out there that the shoot", "32:09", "it's the University in Cannes I'm", "32:11", "blanking on the name of it right now the", "32:13", "university itself put money towards", "32:15", "funding to find it so when you have a", "32:18", "credible institution like a university", "32:20", "going here's money go and find this", "32:21", "thing you've got to think and I'm not a", "32:24", "big conspiracy theorist but you've got", "32:25", "to think they have some Intel that says", "32:27", "look we're not wasting our money to look", "32:29", "for something that's not there we've", "32:30", "heard something we've seen something we", "32:32", "caught something on a trail camera let's", "32:33", "prove it and so I actually teamed up", "32:35", "with they caught something on a trail", "32:36", "camera hard to say but what they did do", "32:38", "is fund this expedition so myself and", "32:40", "the University who's still ongoing with", "32:43", "the research when it looked in this area", "32:45", "in North Queensland where I went and how", "32:46", "far deep did you go in 1,200 miles 1,200", "32:51", "miles yep it took 14 hours driving and", "32:54", "then hiking from there whoa yeah 14", "32:56", "hours on dirt road because this is the", "32:58", "area where they've been sighted the most", "32:59", "numerous this is where that sighting", "33:01", "that I was talking about came from from", "33:03", "the biologist as well as I think for", "33:05", "other sightings the community up there", "33:07", "is a place called Portland", "33:08", "ODEs you could look it up I think it's", "33:10", "12 people and Wow", "33:12", "live totally not like the Amazon off the", "33:15", "grid but off the grid you know it's all", "33:16", "like solar energy and build-it-yourself", "33:18", "there's no power lines blah blah so it's", "33:21", "just this small group of kind of like", "33:23", "people in the middle of nowhere and", "33:24", "almost everybody in that community has", "33:26", "seen them so that's that's where we", "33:28", "based it out of and then went deep from", "33:29", "almost everyone in the community and no", "33:32", "one's took in a photograph that they", "33:33", "have cameras everybody's you know", "33:35", "everybody's got a cell phone kind of", "33:37", "thing but it's like it's all it's always", "33:39", "the same story where it's like yeah it", "33:41", "was there it was late at night by the", "33:42", "time I reached in my pocket it it had", "33:43", "gone off except for the biologist I was", "33:45", "telling you about who said it ran around", "33:46", "with his dogs he's out camping and he's", "33:50", "like oh there's this red eye shine and", "33:52", "my dog goes nuts and runs over there and", "33:53", "then there's four thylacine jumping", "33:55", "around with my dog like for like 15", "33:58", "minutes and he's like I'm trying to get", "33:59", "a picture and you know that's like 300", "34:01", "yards away it's in the dark and without", "34:02", "the flashlight and the phone and like", "34:04", "fuck yeah and so it's basically a", "34:06", "hundred percent of this thing's alive I", "34:08", "mean as a scientist you can never put", "34:10", "that number but to me yes", "34:12", "that's why I've done two expeditions and", "34:14", "I plan on doing more I feel it's out", "34:16", "there like it's a gut feeling that it's", "34:18", "there did you ever see that there was a", "34:20", "woman Defoe movie yeah hunter the hunter", "34:22", "that's right and he goes and shoots the", "34:24", "last one yeah it didn't really work", "34:29", "right the movie was off it's very", "34:31", "strange and there was like a scientific", "34:33", "reason he had to find it or kill it or I", "34:35", "don't know it was almost paying him", "34:37", "wasn't it did someone hire him to do it", "34:39", "but wasn't there a like he was a bounty", "34:42", "hunter for the animal because it had", "34:43", "some weird genome or I I don't remember", "34:45", "it was a member there yeah so but that's", "34:47", "how they died off right people hunting", "34:49", "them put a bounty on them yeah that's", "34:51", "how bad it was", "34:51", "yeah when settlers came to Tasmania", "34:53", "which was the last stronghold for him", "34:56", "they were they were killing sheep and", "34:58", "sheep farmers things and the government", "34:59", "was like get rid of him you know put a", "35:01", "bounty on him what year was this", "35:03", "you'd have to cross-check it's been a", "35:04", "while since I've read read up on that", "35:06", "but the last ones died off in like the", "35:08", "early 1900s right that's right the one", "35:10", "is you think yeah they're all freaky", "35:13", "looking animal there is one set of", "35:14", "footage from it ever from the one in the", "35:16", "Hobart to and it's you look at it's", "35:18", "insane looking creature yes", "35:20", "yeah just nuts you got that", "35:22", "by the video - something playing oh so", "35:23", "playing um yeah it's a freaky animal it", "35:26", "doesn't even look real", "35:27", "it looks like like a cross between a", "35:29", "tiger and a dog or something and it's", "35:30", "and it's kangaroo by genetics it's a", "35:33", "marsupial it's got a pouch and it's just", "35:35", "so weird stripes and that's a strange", "35:38", "thing about Australia and that whole", "35:39", "area is like how did what's this", "35:41", "marsupial thing and why didn't that", "35:42", "catch on anywhere else there it is look", "35:44", "at him there's that freaky thing wait", "35:46", "till you see that there's a shot where", "35:48", "he kind of turns his face and and does", "35:49", "like a yawn and you'll see he can open", "35:51", "his jaw the way like a snake does to", "35:53", "almost 180 degrees I mean it's it's", "35:55", "bizarre yeah just swallow bullet coyotes", "35:59", "are kind of like that - not quite so", "36:01", "extreme but right when you see a coyote", "36:03", "yawning you're like what right the fuck", "36:06", "look at that oh that's so great isn't", "36:08", "that insane yeah it's like a crocodile", "36:09", "almost yeah yeah yeah a strange animal", "36:12", "man I'm I'm obsessed with him I'm", "36:14", "totally fascinated by him yeah I hope", "36:17", "you get a photo of these fuckers yeah me", "36:19", "too I mean do they", "36:21", "so I've in that area did you guys set up", "36:24", "trail cams and we did 200 trail cameras", "36:27", "Wow yeah and then the university that we", "36:29", "partnered with who didn't go as remote", "36:30", "as we did but they're still doing a big", "36:32", "area I think they have 10,000 10,000", "36:35", "trails something crazy like maybe it's a", "36:37", "thousand it's a huge number so what do", "36:39", "you do with those how does that work so", "36:40", "you do like a grid pattern right so you", "36:43", "know how trail camera works motions", "36:44", "activated blah blah so they just they", "36:46", "literally here's the mountains here's", "36:48", "whatever and they set out all these like", "36:50", "undergrads and they're like place one", "36:52", "every three hundred meters pointing you", "36:54", "know in this direction blah blah blah", "36:55", "blah and they just do a grid and they do", "36:58", "that for a month two months whatever it", "37:00", "is collect them all and then move to the", "37:01", "next grid and then move to the next grid", "37:03", "and just blanket the area and I think I", "37:06", "could be wrong on this but I think the", "37:07", "search that they're doing that", "37:08", "University is going to be the most", "37:10", "comprehensive trail camera survey ever", "37:12", "conducted and so as far as you know they", "37:16", "don't have a photo of one yet", "37:17", "as far as we know but think of it this", "37:19", "way again I'm not a big conspiracy guy", "37:20", "but if you're if you're impersonating my", "37:23", "tea when it's like my this price closest", "37:25", "they have a there's a lot of these could", "37:27", "be there's new one that just came out", "37:29", "whoa see to me that's a mangy fox that's", "37:34", "not a thioester No", "37:36", "look at the base of the tails very thin", "37:37", "it's carrying in an upward curve instead", "37:40", "of straight like if you look at", "37:41", "kangaroos tail it's very flat there's a", "37:44", "lot of Fox problems in Australia where", "37:46", "they're introduced could be wrong you", "37:48", "know as a scientist I try not to get too", "37:50", "excited when I see something that I'm", "37:52", "like this is it but it's hard to tell", "37:53", "because the way the grass is sure makes", "37:56", "it look he's got stripes on his back", "37:57", "looking like ah mm-hmm Wow a trail-cam", "37:59", "has captured an image that is excited to", "38:02", "esme knee and tiger hunters to the", "38:03", "possibility the animal may roam freely", "38:05", "across Australia Wow how big is that", "38:08", "thing", "38:09", "they're like coyote sized very similar", "38:11", "to a coyote in size Wow yeah so um don't", "38:16", "you think though that if they had", "38:17", "definitive footage that they would", "38:19", "release it to try to get more funding", "38:20", "and dude the problem is footage isn't", "38:23", "definitive anymore like two years last", "38:25", "year I got a photo of a leopard in", "38:28", "Zanzibar the first time in 25 years the", "38:30", "animals declared extinct and we caught a", "38:32", "video not even a photo a video of a", "38:34", "Zanzibar leopard and took it up the", "38:37", "chain and they're like until unless we", "38:39", "have genetic proof the animal remains", "38:40", "extinct so I think you know so the phone", "38:46", "yeah yeah come on well so yeah I think", "38:49", "that I think you know if the University", "38:52", "had something they're trying to get", "38:53", "enough data to really present a case as", "38:56", "opposed to like you know throwing up a", "38:57", "flag over something into one individual", "39:00", "well is there a concern that's the a", "39:01", "bunch of amateur wildlife hunters would", "39:04", "go there what is this Jim there it is", "39:05", "that's my library the leopard yeah Wow", "39:08", "did you uh have you seen that photo or", "39:11", "the footage rather of the Jaguar that", "39:13", "they found in Arizona", "39:15", "yeah yeah that's really interesting too", "39:16", "right amazing they're starting to make", "39:18", "their way up from Mexico it's such a", "39:19", "weird region that because here's this", "39:21", "huge Sonoran Desert that you think none", "39:23", "of these tropical animals can make it", "39:25", "across and for whatever reason Southern", "39:26", "Arizona gets Jaguars and coatimundi and", "39:29", "peccary and all these like tropical", "39:30", "animals yeah what what the hell I don't", "39:33", "know the answer what the hell's going on", "39:34", "that all these rainforest creatures are", "39:36", "making it through this thousand mile", "39:38", "stretch of desert and into southern", "39:39", "Arizona hardboard it could be acre for a", "39:42", "cool cool places to visit yeah you know", "39:44", "maybe they I mean maybe it's just like a", "39:46", "natural instinct to roam and", "39:48", "and your territory there he is yeah look", "39:50", "at that thing amazing that's an", "39:52", "incredible animal so beautiful and it's", "39:54", "huge huge there-there 200-plus pounds", "39:56", "right have a big fuckin aggressive cat", "39:59", "what's bigger a Jaguar or a leopard", "40:02", "leopard leopard yeah yeah and that's", "40:04", "even bigger mm-hmm but it's a such a", "40:06", "beautiful animal too and apparently they", "40:08", "were all over North America Jaguars in", "40:10", "time yeah like that area like Texas", "40:12", "during the Pleistocene yeah interesting", "40:15", "I didn't even know that but um when did", "40:17", "they I mean they were pushed out of feel", "40:20", "like that might not be true though I", "40:22", "feel like they were they were more", "40:24", "numerous in like Arizona and like the", "40:26", "Southwest makes sense I mean you know we", "40:29", "had so much megafauna here back in the", "40:31", "day there would have been a lot of prey", "40:33", "for them now because of the fact he", "40:36", "spent so much time in the wild and you", "40:39", "know and that you have this interest in", "40:41", "these what would you call cryptozoology", "40:44", "animals I'm not a crypto guy so just to", "40:47", "be clear and nothing against crypto guys", "40:49", "but I don't do Loch Ness or Bigfoot or", "40:51", "anything I'm a true wildlife biologist", "40:53", "so I only focus on wildlife so not to", "40:55", "interrupt you but I'm just very very", "40:57", "structured in the sense that I really", "40:59", "only look for animals that we we have an", "41:02", "understanding of right yeah right well", "41:04", "yeah but the Bigfoot one is the the most", "41:08", "compelling but also probably the most", "41:10", "bullshit I think there's a mix there I", "41:12", "think people believe that they've seen", "41:14", "certain things you know it's it's do I", "41:17", "think that there could have been large", "41:18", "primates that we attribute to Bigfoot", "41:20", "sure whether they're still here or not", "41:22", "whether people have ever seen them I I'm", "41:24", "so like not well read on that isn't it", "41:26", "interesting though that if there was one", "41:29", "it would probably be the most", "41:32", "spectacular find ever absolutely but", "41:34", "meanwhile we have chimps and bonobos", "41:36", "right you know we have all these things", "41:38", "that are real well because there's so", "41:39", "much like lore and culture associated", "41:41", "with it right and not just like our", "41:43", "Western culture but like cave paintings", "41:45", "of big hairy creatures and like", "41:47", "everything I mean it would be like this", "41:49", "mind-blowing discovery have you ever", "41:51", "went and looked for the bondo ape no I", "41:53", "know what it is but no no never gotten", "41:55", "airborne there sure that's a real thing", "41:57", "really yeah they've got skulls and hair", "41:59", "samples and photographs and video", "42:02", "and for people don't know what we're", "42:03", "talking about two gigantic chimpanzee", "42:05", "right like a six-foot tall chimpanzee", "42:07", "and it's just fucking nuts and it does", "42:09", "walk a rack right sometimes yeah yeah", "42:11", "there's a camera trap photo there's a", "42:13", "guy named dr. Karl oh no he's not a", "42:15", "doctor thing's name's Karl Harmon call", "42:18", "Karl something Harmon is that Oman Oman", "42:21", "crawl Oman and he's a it was a swiss", "42:24", "wildlife photographer anyway set up a", "42:27", "bunch of camera traps and he got one go", "42:28", "on walking I mean it's it's freaky and", "42:31", "there's some photos of these gentlemen", "42:33", "that shot one near an airstrip huh and", "42:37", "it's fucking huge you don't know how big", "42:40", "the the men are right they might be", "42:42", "small and in front of them but it is", "42:44", "without a doubt like one of the biggest", "42:46", "chimpanzees you've ever seen since and", "42:47", "yeah they have a crest on their head", "42:49", "their skull has a crest like a gorilla", "42:51", "huh yeah it has like the the bone of the", "42:54", "skull picture that I'd love to see it", "42:58", "I'm not not familiar with the anatomy of", "43:00", "them yeah it's um it's really", "43:03", "interesting because I think for the", "43:04", "longest time they didn't think they're", "43:06", "real is a part of that Michael Crichton", "43:08", "book Congo okay remember there was a", "43:10", "really terrible movie that fucker", "43:14", "yeah that's insane yeah that's one of", "43:16", "them and that thing that doesn't look", "43:18", "like force perspective you know what I", "43:19", "mean it looks like they're right in", "43:21", "front of them and that's one from the", "43:22", "early 1900's I believe where these guys", "43:25", "shot one and there were like what is", "43:29", "this this is just giant chimp go did you", "43:32", "see if you find the one of their it read", "43:33", "above is the one that where it's walking", "43:35", "right there yeah oh that's the

see where", "44:05", "we get that from right sure you look at", "44:07", "this huge primate that's the size of a", "44:09", "human being and your brain instantly", "44:11", "goes it's mythological and I'm pretty", "44:12", "sure", "44:13", "that they didn't have photos of this", "44:14", "thing until the 20th century like the", "44:17", "late 20th century no kidding yeah that's", "44:20", "amazing yeah it's a trip man this they", "44:22", "nest on the ground like like really yeah", "44:24", "yeah Wow and the locals have two", "44:28", "different name for two different names", "44:31", "for chimps they call them tree beaters", "44:33", "and lion killers huh and the tree", "44:36", "beaters are the ones that are up in the", "44:37", "trees a smaller chimps sure and the lion", "44:39",

used a", "46:38", "thermoset what does they call them", "46:40", "fucking is it called a thermos l I think", "46:43", "this was called it's it's a device that", "46:46", "heats up it's got like an element inside", "46:48", "of it and like a little bit little", "46:50", "canister of gasoline and you put these", "46:53", "sheets and it releases this very fine", "46:56", "mist onokay smell and mosquitos fucking", "46:58", "hate it no way yeah we used it in", "47:00", "Alberta huh Alberta has very aggressive", "47:03", "mosquitos when they're out yep when", "47:05", "they're out they're out it's a clouds of", "47:07", "them right yeah cuz you're only alive", "47:08", "for like three months all right it's", "47:10", "like Alaska you've been a last night", "47:12", "it's the worst mosquitos I've ever seen", "47:14", "crazy I pick you up yeah they're like", "47:15", "there's size of pigeons and their family", "47:18", "everywhere totally I went fishing with", "47:20", "my friend Ari and we pulled up the the", "47:22", "car and we got out of the car and we", "47:24", "opened the car door and within seconds a", "47:27", "swarm of mosquitoes was inside the car", "47:29", "it's insane we were screaming like what", "47:31", "the fuck this is crazy it's like", "47:33", "something out of a Stephen King movie", "47:35", "like there's clouds and they III yeah", "47:37", "that's why you asked me what I'm scared", "47:38", "of it's that fucking clouds of", "47:40", "mosquitoes man well we're very fortunate", "47:42", "we don't have malaria here in the United", "47:43", "States yep absolutely that if it made", "47:46", "its way over here somehow", "47:47", "you know I am I wear this fabric you're", "47:50", "talking about thermos l called hex oh", "47:51", "yeah yes yes hex exactly and I work for", "47:56", "a lot of reasons because I definitely", "47:58", "feel it helps me get closer to wildlife", "47:59", "but I've noticed mosquitoes do not like", "48:02", "it really so that's that's what a heck", "48:05", "suit is for people that don't know what", "48:07", "we're talking about sure so it's this", "48:09", "interwoven carbon grid that actually", "48:12", "holds the body's electrical energy and", "48:14", "capacity like the door of microwave oven", "48:16", "like a Faraday cage right and so you you", "48:18", "naturally emit electrical energy and", "48:20", "then when you wear this clothing it's", "48:21", "got this conductive carbon grid and when", "48:23", "you touch the ground or something at", "48:24", "grounds it releases all the energy so", "48:26", "birds migrate you're losing", "48:28", "yeah there you go now has it been proven", "48:30", "that this stuff actually were I mean it", "48:32", "has been proved that it has an effect on", "48:34", "the electrical energy that you release", "48:36", "but has it been proven that the animals", "48:37", "can actually recognize that electrical", "48:39", "energy with sir", "48:40", "animals

everything you", "49:00", "know our understanding of animal", "49:02", "behavior and animal adaptability is", "49:05", "constantly growing so it's passive you", "49:08", "know what I mean I wear it because it's", "49:09", "a passive technology it's like I'm gonna", "49:12", "wear a shirt anyway why not wear one", "49:14", "that might or might not help so my feel", "49:16", "it helps my friend John Dudley is a bow", "49:18", "hunter", "49:19", "yeah pretty famous bow hunt I know John", "49:21", "yeah okay and he swears by it yeah he", "49:24", "wears them constantly I it makes a big", "49:26", "difference I think so you know like I'm", "49:28", "I'm not hunting I'm just trying to get", "49:30", "close to stuff and interact with it or", "49:32", "find something but I feel it makes a", "49:34", "difference you notice a difference", "49:35", "personally especially with Birds", "49:37", "I've noticed a huge difference I've", "49:38", "noticed a huge difference in the water", "49:40", "some mammals I've noticed the difference", "49:42", "but yeah I like John I feel like it's it", "49:46", "helps me get closer and you know it", "49:47", "keeps keeps the energy down do you know", "49:49", "what I mean like you're emitting all", "49:50", "this energy you see this bear or", "49:52", "whatever it is your heart spikes your", "49:53", "adrenaline goes and it keeps that in", "49:55", "capacity so I think we sense that I", "49:58", "think certain creatures sense that and I", "50:00", "I like to keep that out of the equation", "50:02", "right the I guess it would be that there", "50:05", "is something coming off of your body and", "50:06", "it probably would be an advantage for", "50:08", "animals to be able to recognize that", "50:10", "just because we can't quantify it right", "50:12", "and put it on a scale and weigh it or", "50:14", "something like that's probably something", "50:15", "going on predator prey right like yeah", "50:17", "if you're a lion and I'm an antelope and", "50:20", "my adrenaline spikes and my heart's", "50:22", "going and you know you're gonna come for", "50:24", "me but if that's out of the equation the", "50:27", "energy stays reduced well that's one of", "50:29", "the weirder video some of the weirder", "50:30", "videos that I've seen I should say was", "50:32", "people that are interacting with", "50:34", "predators so who like people that have", "50:35", "like coyotes come right up to them while", "50:37", "they're wearing those things yep yeah", "50:39", "and and turkeys as well it totally like", "50:43", "I said Birds because birds birds have", "50:44", "that in their brain they have I'm gonna", "50:47", "quote it wrong but they have something", "50:48", "that they can detect electrical signals", "50:50", "with what helps them migrate around the", "50:52", "world so for sure I think", "50:53", "the difference yeah so what else do you", "50:55", "use use the hex suit a ton of different", "50:58", "tools man I mean I customized stuff you", "51:01", "know like in the Amazon we were looking", "51:02", "for caiman and type of crocodile so I", "51:04", "melt like a beefed-up dog catcher that I", "51:06", "used to try and last sue them I have a", "51:08", "snake hook on me at all times cook yeah", "51:11", "that's a snake hook so it's just this", "51:13", "like it's like a golf club with a hook", "51:15", "on the end so I can work with venomous", "51:17", "snakes without it reaching back and", "51:18", "grabbing well doesn't restrain them it", "51:20", "actually like their body sits in it I do", "51:23", "a lot of reptile stuff so I always have", "51:25", "a snake hook on me I mean the list goes", "51:28", "on ton of trail cameras I use a lot of", "51:30", "thermal-imaging stuff like especially", "51:32", "like looking for wolves or something", "51:34", "like that we you know wolves are active", "51:37", "at night it's really hard to get a shot", "51:38", "of them put a thermal bird in the air", "51:40", "and you can see these these animals", "51:42", "running through valleys Wow", "51:43", "yeah it's cool stuff you'd love it well", "51:46", "I'm fascinated by wolves I think that", "51:48", "wolves to me are probably the most", "51:50", "interesting animal in the wild canids", "51:53", "man wild dogs of all kind are", "51:56", "unbelievable they're so at the top of", "51:59", "their respective food chain yeah we have", "52:01", "a lot of coyotes around here and yeah", "52:03", "basically they're little wolves the", "52:05", "little sneaky wolves but real wolves", "52:08", "like wolves in Yellowstone", "52:09", "you know wolves in the northwest yeah", "52:13", "area of the United States though they", "52:15", "have got to be some of the most majestic", "52:17", "animals fantastic they were there they", "52:20", "operate together yeah always", "52:22", "these packs yep you know so there's some", "52:24", "sort of weird kind of communication and", "52:26", "and what's amazing is like the social", "52:28", "dynamic like within the pack you know", "52:30", "the hierarchy and then on a hunt like", "52:32", "you go left I go right but without any", "52:35", "verbal communication right right and", "52:36", "then coming together and making a kill I", "52:38", "mean it's mind-blowing stuff you know", "52:40", "you talk about not understanding", "52:40", "wildlife we don't understand how they do", "52:43", "that right right we don't understand", "52:44", "what kind of communication is going on", "52:46", "do you think there's some sort of like", "52:48", "telepathic or is it just facial and", "52:51", "recognizing cues and patterns that", "52:55", "they've established before of they see", "52:56", "an animal they know to flank it I", "52:58", "definitely believe it's that like I", "53:00", "definitely believe there is an intrinsic", "53:02", "understanding of you go left I go right", "53:04", "you know facial recognition", "53:07", "your your expression tells me to do", "53:09", "something you're dominant I'm passive", "53:11", "you know learning that way but I also", "53:14", "think there's something more than that", "53:16", "whether it's telepathic whether it's a", "53:18", "low frequency sound that where it's not", "53:20", "audible to us I have no idea but I do", "53:22", "think it's more than just visual cues", "53:24", "that's where the apparently the myth of", "53:27", "the werewolf comes from is that wolves", "53:29", "are so smart they think that wolf and a", "53:31", "person were like combined together I I", "53:34", "don't believe that per se but I can see", "53:37", "how that came up you know I mean it's", "53:39", "totally they're so smart African wild", "53:41", "dogs are the same like they they hunting", "53:43", "these huge packs they go over these", "53:45", "massive areas and then they'll push a", "53:46", "single animal into one area to make the", "53:48", "kill and they're not big animals there", "53:50", "again like our coyote size and they'll", "53:52", "take down you know a kudu or some huge", "53:54", "antelope I mean it's it's incredible", "53:56", "well African wild dogs are so", "53:58", "cool-looking - those black spots yellow", "54:01", "and all the stunning they just they look", "54:03", "angry they look freaky looking", "54:05", "you know there's III think they're", "54:07", "they're my favorite of the kid like you", "54:09", "love wolves I love African Wild Dogs I", "54:11", "just think they're so beautiful and", "54:12", "majestic and unusual and they're just", "54:14", "such a cool animal correct me if I'm", "54:17", "wrong but I think all of them come from", "54:18", "the United States I think all of them", "54:20", "originally came from North America like", "54:22", "I think Canada yeah all candidates came", "54:24", "from North America I think that's coyote", "54:27", "America the gentleman who's been on the", "54:28", "podcast before what is his name is", "54:32", "escaping me right now but he he wrote", "54:36", "about it huh about you know all the the", "54:38", "various and with it jackals and Flores", "54:41", "Dan Flores that's it he's that is a", "54:43", "fascinating book yeah I'm gonna write it", "54:45", "down yeah I'd love to read it great and", "54:47", "I did a podcast with him years ago", "54:49", "that's excellent too and he he has all", "54:52", "sorts of crazy insight as to Native", "54:54", "American North American animals that", "54:56", "went somewhere else like horses like", "55:00", "horses were native to North America but", "55:03", "they weren't here when the European", "55:04", "settlers came they did they went extinct", "55:06", "they had been taken they had there were", "55:09", "other places like apparently wild horses", "55:12", "from Europe all originated from North", "55:14", "America and were taken over and then how", "55:16", "or another well from whatever and then", "55:18", "went extinct here", "55:20", "were reintroduced with the European", "55:22", "settlers huh that's interesting crazy", "55:24", "yeah it's fat and that's the thing like", "55:26", "with what I do looking for extinct", "55:27", "animals or proof that they're still out", "55:29", "there is like there are so many stories", "55:30", "like that I didn't know that one in", "55:32", "specific America is very well covered", "55:35", "with eyeballs but what's to say there", "55:38", "isn't some remnant small population", "55:40", "somewhere in the middle of nowhere that", "55:42", "nobody has found these horses that have", "55:45", "been untouched by human beings for", "55:46", "millennia right and that's that's what I", "55:48", "that's what I do that's what drives me", "55:50", "right find this pocket find this animal", "55:52", "that's been hiding out undetected for", "55:55", "thousands of years yeah", "55:57", "so what other animals are you looking", "55:59", "for a lot like we're talking about", "56:01", "primates I'm going to Borneo to look for", "56:03", "an animal called the millers grizzled", "56:05", "Langer it's a type of monkey I just got", "56:08", "back I was looking for an extinct caiman", "56:09", "in the Amazon stink caiman yeah what's", "56:12", "the difference in that in the Caymans", "56:14", "that you see just a different species", "56:16", "you know just like there's many types of", "56:18", "crocodile there's many types of caiman", "56:19", "you know you have saltwater crocodiles", "56:21", "now a crocodile the same thing with", "56:22", "caiman and I was looking for one with a", "56:25", "very weird morphological variant it", "56:27", "looks very very different to any other", "56:30", "what's different but it's got a very", "56:32", "elongated snout", "56:34", "if you've ever seen agario if you know", "56:35", "what that is type of crocodile with this", "56:37", "long crazy nose it's like the alligator", "56:39", "family that came and family version of", "56:41", "that this really long skinny face super", "56:43", "light super yellow coloration just very", "56:46", "different last time one was seen was 52", "56:48", "years ago and then they had one in the", "56:50", "zoo that died in the 80s and nobody's", "56:52", "found one since so just really cool and", "56:55", "so yeah the list goes on you know last", "56:57", "year I did leopards and I did wolves and", "56:59", "Newfoundland and a bunch of really", "57:01", "interesting stuff so it's fun man you", "57:03", "love it you should come with I'll talk", "57:04", "to him again I'm such a pussy", "57:08", "what about giant sloths what are your", "57:10", "feelings on those so I've had probably", "57:13", "three years of research into this into", "57:15", "giant sloths because Matt Nana who agree", "57:19", "I believe is how it's said it's the", "57:20", "South American name for giant sloths", "57:22", "there's I don't want to give away too", "57:24", "much info before I get to do a chance a", "57:26", "chance at looking for it but after all", "57:28", "the research I've compiled there is in", "57:30", "my opinion one location on earth it's in", "57:34", "hi Peru where nobody goes it's a bowl of", "57:37", "mountains impenetrable the only way and", "57:40", "is a helicopter in the center to me that", "57:43", "that ball is going to be like a", "57:45", "primordial Eden all of the cultures", "57:48", "surrounding it have old stories of giant", "57:51", "sloths they all have different names for", "57:53", "it but they all have these stories of", "57:54", "these giant sloths right they were all", "57:56", "hunted to extinction however they've", "57:58", "handed down these traditions but nobody", "58:00", "except for you know a tiny handful of", "58:02", "like far-out tribal people have ever", "58:05", "really got into this impenetrable ball", "58:07", "and I think if they're anywhere they're", "58:08", "in there Wow", "58:09", "I saw a documentary once about this", "58:11", "scientist that was essentially risking", "58:13", "his reputation trying to find a giant", "58:15", "sloth somewhere that's that maybe in the", "58:17", "Amazon somewhere probably Peruvian", "58:19", "Amazon that's where I'm thinking too and", "58:20", "he he kept talking to people that had", "58:23", "seen it and he never could get ahold of", "58:25", "it but he had been there for years", "58:26", "isn't it crazy though like why yeah what", "58:30", "if you're a little Amazonian villager", "58:32", "you don't read you don't have TV there's", "58:34", "no reason to make up scientific you know", "58:36", "science fiction why say you've seen it", "58:38", "because you like to fuck with white", "58:40", "people could be could be you're", "58:51", "exhausted covered with mosquito bites", "58:53", "he's like any day now yeah yeah just", "58:55", "over the next hill he's gonna wait for", "58:57", "you to fucking rot out there'll be a", "59:00", "mean man that's a mean guy you wanna log", "59:03", "all right buddy", "59:04", "patch on the back there's the last spot", "59:06", "for you and I'll be taking this yeah", "59:08", "I'll take your binocular yeah yeah I", "59:12", "mean yeah there's no reason for them to", "59:14", "lie but right it doesn't that's like the", "59:16", "thing that people say about everything", "59:17", "why was your in lie well people why for", "59:20", "a bunch of weird reasons people do it", "59:22", "people are crazy shit up true yeah yeah", "59:25", "I mean to me it's like you have to take", "59:27", "an eyewitness report of an extinct", "59:29", "creature or zoo crypto creature with a", "59:33", "grain of salt yeah but you still have to", "59:35", "take it do you know what I mean you", "59:36", "still have to bank it and consider it", "59:37", "yeah and so that's that's kind of the", "59:39", "way I go I I always talk to people but", "59:42", "then I come up with I do the biology", "59:44", "right I track I put the cameras", "59:46", "I paid I sent I do all of that stuff to", "59:49", "try and get evidence of my own because", "59:51", "just going with eyewitness reports is", "59:53", "like you say it's nothing is there ever", "59:55", "been any eyewitness reports that are", "59:57", "just too too ridiculous where you like", "60:00", "oh for sure like what", "60:01", "oh man loads I mean like talk about the", "60:05", "thylacine for instance there was a guy", "60:07", "that we met there who's like yeah", "60:09", "there's Styles seen everywhere they run", "60:10", "around with the black cats and we're", "60:12", "like what he's like yeah there's Black", "60:13", "Panthers - they like hang out together", "60:15", "black I'm lengthers in Australia exactly", "60:17", "that I made the same face you did so I'm", "60:19", "like okay tell me more and he's like", "60:21", "yeah you know they like to hang out over", "60:22", "there there behind the trash heap they", "60:24", "jump around with Black Panthers oh", "60:26", "they're just fucking and I'm like", "60:27", "alright well that's the thing I'm like", "60:28", "you're you're just you're either crazy", "60:30", "or you're completely fucking with me and", "60:32", "I'm not sure which one it is because", "60:33", "your eyes are telling me crazy", "60:34", "well yeah well I mean how many different", "60:38", "pockets in the world are there like that", "60:40", "Basin that you said you gotta get", "60:42", "helicoptered into there's a few yeah a", "60:44", "few yeah you'd be surprised because you", "60:45", "know we're here we're in a city we're so", "60:47", "used to our modern conveniences but", "60:49", "there are totally untouched pieces of", "60:51", "the world still well do you know David", "60:53", "Cho the artist I don't he he went to the", "60:57", "Congo I think was a Congo to look for a", "60:59", "dinosaur no it was a really early vais", "61:03", "piece back when vice was first starting", "61:05", "out and David is one of the more", "61:08", "eccentric people that I know he's a", "61:10", "multi-millionaire made a shitload of", "61:12", "money gambling and also he made a", "61:15", "shitload of money because he was at", "61:16", "Facebook painted yeah I painted Facebook", "61:19", "what does that mean to the wall yeah the", "61:21", "inside they hired him to paint like do", "61:24", "these murals and they gave him stock and", "61:27", "that stock wound up being worth hundreds", "61:29", "of millions of dollars and so he's just", "61:31", "this freaky super talented artist yeah", "61:35", "who is just doing weird shit and one of", "61:37", "the things they did was like hey man you", "61:38", "want to go look for a dinosaur he's like", "61:39", "okay I'll go absolutely why wouldn't you", "61:42", "but there's this video of him I want to", "61:45", "say he was like 25 at the time - I think", "61:47", "he was pretty young yeah look at him", "61:49", "there oh yeah so he's in the jungle in", "61:51", "search of a fucking dinosaur huh because", "61:53", "and it was one of those things where the", "61:55", "the locals were saying hey mister", "61:57", "there's a dinosaur in the Congo", "61:59", "right which doesn't totally make sense", "62:02", "but it but yeah but who knows right why", "62:06", "not investigate it kind of thing but I", "62:08", "mean how big of an area would there have", "62:10", "to be for there to be a species that we", "62:13", "are not aware of like how big of an area", "62:16", "oh I mean you know that's that's it's a", "62:18", "generic question because we discover", "62:20", "you'd have to look up the numbers but", "62:21", "it's like 2,000 new species a year right", "62:23", "little stuff but mostly little stuff", "62:25", "there's an animal discovered the most", "62:28", "recently there's an animal called the", "62:29", "Salwa it's an animal that I'm actually", "62:31", "working on later this year and it is a", "62:33", "an antelope like they call it the Asian", "62:36", "unicorn because for generations people", "62:38", "have been talking about this asian", "62:39", "unicorn and Western world's like yeah", "62:41", "whatever whatever whatever and then", "62:43", "finally somebody went down there into", "62:44", "the Laotian mountains and and was like", "62:47", "here's a skull and here's a skin and", "62:48", "they're like holy shit this is a real", "62:50", "thing and this is like in a pot not", "62:52", "populated but there's plenty of people", "62:54", "living there you know what I mean this", "62:55", "isn't like this isn't like the middle of", "62:58", "nowhere this is where there's villages", "62:59", "and tribes and people and they're like", "63:02", "here's this animal here's the skin", "63:03", "here's a skull and since then I think", "63:05", "one trail camera has the photo has ever", "63:08", "surfaced like nobody's ever successfully", "63:10", "documented it because it's just this", "63:12", "incredibly elusive animal like whether", "63:15", "it has super sensory organs you know", "63:16", "hearing sight smell whatever it is or", "63:18", "it's just super low density and", "63:21", "population nobody really knows but this", "63:23", "animal this this huge like antelope has", "63:26", "been around forever people little tribal", "63:29", "people have been talking about it in", "63:30", "like a mythological way the same way", "63:32", "they would talk about dinosaurs in the", "63:33", "Congo and the Western world is going", "63:35", "sure buddy whatever you say and then", "63:37", "somebody finally goes down there does an", "63:39", "expedition just like David did and goes", "63:41", "oh it turns out it's here Wow", "63:44", "what is it about animals where we're so", "63:47", "fascinated by the ones that might not be", "63:49", "real or that might be hidden like what", "63:51", "what is it about them we I mean people", "63:54", "love to study giraffes there are things", "63:56", "that are absolutely real but they also", "63:58", "have a even more compelling need to", "64:02", "search for things that are not quite", "64:04", "sure that I'm not quite sure if they", "64:07", "exist or not I don't know man I think", "64:09", "it's like it's human nature to want to", "64:12", "know more", "64:13", "like we of course like not everybody you", "64:15", "see a giraffe you're like it's real I", "64:17", "know it", "64:17", "banked it right some people go to the", "64:19", "extreme they study every aspect of it", "64:21", "but as a general populace I feel like", "64:23", "once we know something's there we want", "64:25", "to know what the next thing is yeah I", "64:26", "mean we what do you think like what why", "64:28", "why is it that we're so fascinated with", "64:30", "it I don't know the answer I think it's", "64:32", "probably a side effect of our compulsion", "64:35", "for innovation like human beings are", "64:38", "constantly trying to find out new", "64:39", "secrets aren't find you know like find", "64:42", "out new discoveries and invent new", "64:44", "things and fine explore new world yep I", "64:47", "mean this is just something that's been", "64:49", "a part of human nature forever this", "64:51", "desire to improve right and to go", "64:53", "further fund the next best spot but a", "64:55", "new thing you know and then I think that", "64:58", "also works with animals I think we have", "65:00", "this desire to find animals that we", "65:02", "didn't know a real or weren't sure real", "65:04", "well knowledge is the foundation of that", "65:06", "right to go to a new planet we have to", "65:08", "have the knowledge of how to get there", "65:10", "right to go to a new habitat we have to", "65:12", "know what's there and I think maybe", "65:13", "that's that's kind of that deep rooted", "65:15", "desire is like we need to know about", "65:17", "this thing in order to to understand if", "65:20", "we can innovate off of it", "65:21", "yeah maybe yeah what did you think when", "65:24", "they found that Flores man on in", "65:27", "Indonesia it's amazing like I'm not an", "65:30", "anthropologist so you know that's not", "65:32", "quite I've been a hundred percent is", "65:33", "that 100 percent agreed upon I've only", "65:36", "seen kind of headlines I have to defer", "65:38", "to you guys I think there was one there", "65:40", "was some scientist that was disputing", "65:42", "but but essentially they were talking", "65:43", "about a three-foot tall Hobbit like man", "65:45", "yeah kind of cave dwelling yeah little", "65:49", "person existed alongside human beings as", "65:51", "recently as like 14,000 years ago right", "65:53", "right which is like what I I think it's", "65:56", "completely believable I mean they're the", "65:58", "Kois and people in this Horan desert are", "66:01", "tiny you know they're they're a big like", "66:03", "four feet and until the you might have", "66:06", "to double-check this but I believe until", "66:07", "the 70s people used to go and hunt them", "66:09", "maybe it was earlier or 60s or 50s but", "66:11", "you could go and hunt this primitive", "66:13", "sized human being as like a pay you know", "66:16", "as like a hunt like an old Englishman", "66:18", "with his big moustache and his musket", "66:20", "would go hunt these people whoa and now", "66:22", "we have an understanding that you know", "66:23", "they're people like you can't fucking go", "66:25", "and hunt them but like what's to say", "66:28", "there weren't tribes like that all over", "66:29", "the world that other people used to hunt", "66:31", "that drove to extinction mmm Jesus", "66:35", "Christ", "66:36", "right what say the name of it again so", "66:39", "Jim you got it you got some koi Sam yeah", "66:41", "let me see what these people look like", "66:42", "they're in my opinion they're beautiful", "66:45", "like you'll see what you think but", "66:46", "they're they're very small they're", "66:47", "desert dwell you know there's not a lot", "66:49", "of resources in the desert so you don't", "66:51", "get huge so they're perfectly adapted to", "66:53", "the desert life they really used to hunt", "66:55", "them yeah and they look just like people", "66:57", "I mean you'll have but they're still", "67:02", "around like these aren't extinct race", "67:04", "they're still there oh wow yeah the", "67:06", "everything the gods must be crazy", "67:08", "yes yeah it's like those people those", "67:10", "were kind of taller Khoisan but those", "67:12", "are Bushmen so who these people used to", "67:17", "hunt these like I say I kid you not it", "67:20", "was like the old English explorer would", "67:22", "go and conquer Africa and and hunt these", "67:24", "people like they were an animal you know", "67:26", "fuck crazy right", "67:28", "this was until the 1970s that might not", "67:30", "be right that sounds too recent doesn't", "67:32", "know god damn that sounds horrific yeah", "67:34", "you might need to check that but it was", "67:36", "not as long ago as you'd think you know", "67:38", "I mean it was like very recently they", "67:40", "were still under under hunting and their", "67:43", "people yeah Jesus Christ yeah so that", "67:47", "that's probably what happened to a lot", "67:49", "of the non homo sapien human type people", "67:53", "I would think so and even if it's not", "67:55", "like for sport it's for competition or", "67:57", "resources or you know what any reason", "68:00", "yeah", "68:00", "and that's that's human nature conquer", "68:02", "yeah fuck man that is so dark right they", "68:07", "would go and hunt small people with a", "68:09", "rifle", "68:10", "yep you know it's nice if their photos", "68:12", "of people like posing with the dead ones", "68:14", "um again I'm not an anthropologist I'm", "68:16", "not sure yeah", "68:18", "it's brutal yeah mmm so what are the", "68:22", "pockets of the world are like mostly", "68:25", "unexplored or could perhaps contain some", "68:28", "of these animals South America for sure", "68:30", "Central Africa for sure there's some", "68:32", "very remote parts of like Russian Arctic", "68:35", "Norwegian Arctic", "68:38", "there's areas in Asia that are still", "68:40", "unexplored believe it or not regardless", "68:41", "they're populous they really are deep", "68:43", "deep China there's some very unexplored", "68:45", "areas northern Myanmar ecological hot", "68:49", "spot nobody goes there very impenetrable", "68:52", "I read something about there was some", "68:54", "part of the world where they thought", "68:55", "pterodactyls might still exist there's", "68:57", "so many of those things I don't know", "68:59", "that one specifically there's especially", "69:01", "doing what I do I hear them all the time", "69:02", "right no you got to go look for", "69:03", "Bigfoot's or pterodactyls or whatever", "69:06", "man that's it's you could there be a", "69:09", "large reptile that perhaps flies sure", "69:11", "it's possible", "69:13", "is there a pterodactyl as we know it I", "69:15", "highly highly doubt it but a large", "69:17", "reptile that could fly would be a", "69:19", "fucking trip they were around right so", "69:21", "do you think it would be something that", "69:22", "we don't know about like yeah basically", "69:24", "I think there's enough pieces of this", "69:27", "world that are unexplored that there are", "69:29", "still megafauna to be discovered know it", "69:31", "a lot not a lot by any means and I might", "69:33", "get ridiculed as I go back to my", "69:34", "scientific community for saying this but", "69:36", "my belief is there are these isolated", "69:38", "pockets where small populations of", "69:41", "megafauna still exist that we don't know", "69:42", "about whoa yeah well South America is I", "69:47", "mean how much of South America is", "69:48", "actually populated I mean you look at", "69:51", "the size of the Amazon jungle or", "69:52", "something and it's it's the sure there's", "69:54", "there's communities and stuff but not", "69:56", "that much I mean it's there it Australia", "69:59", "you know if you're not on the coast", "70:00", "there's nothing right yeah there's all", "70:02", "these huge chunks Papua New Guinea same", "70:04", "thing nobody goes up into the highlands", "70:05", "there they just found a dog there as you", "70:07", "saw I mean there's crazy stuff now what", "70:10", "do you think about these guys that are", "70:13", "talking about bringing animals back um", "70:16", "like as a scientist sure the extinction", "70:20", "is it's a weird word it is it is its", "70:22", "reintroduction is that they call it the", "70:25", "extinction so that's what they call it", "70:26", "yeah the extinction is to me it's", "70:29", "fascinating especially if it's something", "70:31", "like say the passenger pigeon right we", "70:33", "used to have billions of them in the", "70:35", "United States wiped him out and now", "70:38", "they're saying you know that we can take", "70:41", "the closest living relative isolate some", "70:44", "genes and make a new passenger pigeon is", "70:46", "that worth it because it's something we", "70:48", "wiped out in the last hundred years yes", "70:49", "I feel like that's", "70:51", "we should heal the ecosystem by putting", "70:53", "that back right that being said we still", "70:56", "need to learn from our mistakes like we", "70:58", "need to take into account what we did", "70:59", "and why we did it and like do I think", "71:02", "there should be a Jurassic Park and a", "71:03", "bunch of mammoths and t-rex is", "71:04", "absolutely not that's a waste whether we", "71:06", "can or cannot do it to me that's a waste", "71:08", "of scientific resources that could go", "71:10", "towards conserving things that are on", "71:12", "the brink", "71:12", "now when you say like heal or mend the", "71:16", "environment or the ecosystem when you", "71:19", "would bring back something like a", "71:19", "passenger pigeon isn't like 90% of", "71:21", "everything that ever existed extinct", "71:23", "sure absolutely does the ecosystem", "71:26", "adjust and evolve and would", "71:27", "reintroducing something like a passenger", "71:29", "pigeon would it kind of fuck things up", "71:31", "that exists now where new animals have", "71:33", "taken a different position on the", "71:35", "hierarchy it's too short an evolutionary", "71:37", "time so we are in what's called the", "71:39", "sixth mass extinction event right", "71:41", "there's been five others before us the", "71:43", "one we're in now it's happening at 80%", "71:45", "greater rate than it's ever happened", "71:47", "before", "71:47", "so we are wiping out things more quickly", "71:50", "than the world can adapt so you know you", "71:53", "go into an environment and you take out", "71:55", "all the apex predators the prey explodes", "71:58", "the prey explodes the grass gets eaten", "72:00", "down everything collapses now if you", "72:02", "left that environment over time a", "72:04", "revolutionary time it would adapt right", "72:07", "maybe say say all of the Predators got a", "72:10", "disease and they died out died out over", "72:13", "300 generations during that time", "72:15", "something would evolve within the", "72:17", "environment to adapt the prey so that it", "72:20", "didn't wipe out the environment that's", "72:22", "just kind of the nature's balance but", "72:23", "when you go in there and do it in ten", "72:25", "years or five years it throws off the", "72:27", "equilibrium so when you in theory when", "72:30", "you reintroduce something that's been", "72:32", "and it's not theory it's it's science", "72:34", "they've shown this even right here in", "72:35", "the California Channel Islands when you", "72:37", "put something back that's missing from", "72:38", "the ecosystem it's like you're putting a", "72:40", "piece of the puzzle back right and then", "72:42", "you can allow it to do its thing over", "72:44", "evolutionary time what did they do in", "72:46", "the Channel Islands so I was actually a", "72:48", "big part of that and I loved loved the", "72:49", "project so the California Channel", "72:51", "Islands were settled by agriculture", "72:53", "there were sheeps goats pigs bla bla", "72:54", "there was everything brought over there", "72:55", "right and so not catalina but think", "72:57", "about the northern Channel Islands what", "73:00", "happened was when all these animals were", "73:01", "brought in all the farmers were there", "73:02", "then Golden Eagles", "73:04", "coming over Golden Eagles came over to", "73:06", "eat the pigs and everything else flew", "73:09", "across the ocean yep", "73:10", "flew across the channel started preying", "73:11", "on pigs and everything else there was an", "73:13", "animal on the Channel Islands called the", "73:14", "channel on Fox a very gorgeous cute", "73:17", "cuddly little fox you can see him if you", "73:19", "go to Santa Cruz Island there's loads of", "73:21", "them now thanks to the work that", "73:22", "scientists have done anyway they were", "73:24", "like okay", "73:25", "the Fox is being there it is oh so the", "73:30", "Fox is being wiped out through habitat", "73:32", "destruction through all these undulates", "73:33", "that have been brought in so scientists", "73:36", "got together and what undulates like", "73:37", "cows yeah yeah domestic animals cows", "73:39", "sheep goats etc so scientists came in", "73:42", "and said you know the habitats getting", "73:43", "destroyed the and that that's just the", "73:45", "keystone there were several species that", "73:47", "were on the decline the cows are getting", "73:49", "the livestock is wiping out the habitat", "73:52", "the foxes are declining what do we do", "73:54", "well obvious answer let's remove all the", "73:56", "livestock so we removed all the", "73:58", "livestock right through helicopters", "73:59", "there's a lot of pigs that were causing", "74:01", "damage all that kind of stuff we removed", "74:02", "it all then the Golden Eagles started", "74:04", "preying on the Foxes because their main", "74:06", "habitat was gone so now the Foxes are", "74:08", "under even more pressure so then we", "74:09", "remove the Golden Eagles this is a very", "74:11", "abridged version of what happened but", "74:13", "now we've got the Golden Eagle also", "74:15", "pushed out the bald eagle which are fish", "74:17", "eaters which lived on the island", "74:18", "so now after loads of years of removing", "74:20", "Golden Eagles like relocating them", "74:22", "removing all of the livestock now you", "74:24", "have a healthy population of Channel", "74:25", "Island foxes the bald eagles are back", "74:27", "they're eating fish the whole ecosystem", "74:28", "is back in balance had it been left the", "74:31", "way it was what you would have found at", "74:32", "the californian Channel Islands over say", "74:34", "20 or 30 more years 40 or 50 more years", "74:36", "no foxes no no bald eagles a ton of", "74:39", "golden eagles and a ton of pigs and", "74:41", "likely over time pigs would have", "74:43", "exploded to the point that they Easter", "74:45", "Island themselves right they ate up all", "74:46", "the resources destroyed all the habitat", "74:48", "population collapsed Golden Eagles", "74:50", "collapse nothing left on the island what", "74:51", "do you mean by Easter Island themselves", "74:53", "so you're familiar with Easter Island in", "74:54", "South America I know what those statues", "74:56", "are and all that stuff but I'm not", "74:58", "familiar with what happened to cherylin", "75:00", "so that Island is was an ancient", "75:02", "civilization that was the mecca had", "75:04", "everything off land had big trees tons", "75:06", "of food blah blah blah blah people", "75:08", "settled there and they said this place", "75:10", "is incredible it's paradisiacal", "75:13", "and then they started cutting down the", "75:15", "trees to fish they started eating all", "75:17", "the mammals", "75:18", "and what actually happened is because", "75:19", "they were so remote the middle of the", "75:21", "ocean nowhere near South America nowhere", "75:22", "near anywhere else they cut down the", "75:24", "last tree there were no more canoes", "75:26", "there was no more food on the island and", "75:28", "the population collapsed the island was", "75:30", "barren it was void of trees void of life", "75:32", "void of anything and they didn't have", "75:34", "the canoes or anything to leave anymore", "75:35", "because they cut down the last tree to", "75:37", "build build a boat or make firewood and", "75:39", "everybody there died oh shit so that", "75:42", "that's what happens when you use up", "75:45", "every last resource God so Wow when did", "75:49", "this happen I couldn't couldn't tell you", "75:52", "yes I thought it was like a mystery to", "75:53", "like what happened to the population in", "75:55", "the Easter Island so they're pretty", "75:56", "that's your that's the accepted that's", "75:58", "the scientifically accepted understand", "76:00", "and did they get this from fossils they", "76:02", "get this from bones and is that so they", "76:04", "they've sort of pieced it together", "76:06", "yep they took they take you know isotope", "76:08", "samples and measure carbon dating and", "76:10", "yada yada I think that the heads are", "76:12", "still a pretty big mystery why I think", "76:14", "certain people believe that the heads", "76:16", "were like a nail you know calling to the", "76:19", "gods to help save things because they", "76:20", "were going so badly yada yada but I", "76:22", "believe the heads are still a pretty big", "76:24", "mystery but the actual anthropology the", "76:26", "population to collapse is is known to be", "76:28", "due to running out of resources how long", "76:31", "did it go for good holy do they have an", "76:34", "idea of how long the population lasted I", "76:36", "think it's all I think it's all", "76:37", "published yeah I don't know off the top", "76:39", "of my head but it was it was a thriving", "76:41", "population that you know flew too close", "76:43", "to the Sun is they said because of", "76:46", "Easter Island small size only 63 square", "76:48", "miles it quickly became overpopulated", "76:50", "its resources were rapidly depleted when", "76:52", "Europeans arrived on Easter Island", "76:53", "between the late 1700s in the early", "76:56", "1800s it was reported that the moai were", "76:59", "knocked down and the island seemed to", "77:01", "that I say that right moai be the night", "77:03", "knocked down and the island seemed to", "77:06", "have been a recent war site hmm last was", "77:11", "yeah see the next one their constant", "77:13", "warfare between the tribes the lack of", "77:15", "surprising resources disease invasive", "77:18", "species and the opening of the island to", "77:21", "foreign slave trade eventually led to", "77:23", "Easter islands collapsed by the 1860s", "77:26", "so it didn't take long 1,700 to the", "77:29", "1860s that was rap wow it was annexed by", "77:32", "Chile and so they've never tried to", "77:35", "repopulate the island with trees or", "77:37", "anything else and they're just kind of", "77:38", "leave it alone I believe so I know you", "77:39", "can go there and visit it and see the", "77:41", "heads and I think there are some things", "77:42", "there now but it's it's barren there are", "77:44", "no trees there's no you know it's all", "77:46", "been depleted it's so crazy when they", "77:48", "introduce animals to an island and it", "77:51", "winds up fucking everything up like", "77:52", "Galapagos Island you know and I'm sure", "77:55", "you're familiar with the Judas Judas", "77:57", "goats Judas goats are those the ones on", "77:59", "the Galapagos do you know how they do", "78:00", "that", "78:01", "I don't hate goats it's really", "78:03", "interesting not from that helicopters", "78:04", "yeah well this is how they do it they", "78:06", "cast goats like to hang out together", "78:07", "right but sometimes hard to locate them", "78:09", "so they put a radio collar on one goat", "78:12", "they castrate it and then they let it", "78:13", "loose and they gunned down all the goats", "78:16", "around it and let that go go find the", "78:18", "rest of the goats no it goes and finds", "78:20",

for 48", "78:49", "hours when we arrives I'm an eating seed", "78:51", "so you don't shit it out exactly Wow", "78:52", "yeah quarantine for 48 hours yep", "78:56", "Wow why is there so much concern about", "78:59", "this one area I mean it's the dawn of", "79:02", "evolution you know it's where Darwin", "79:04", "came up with a theory of evolution due", "79:06", "to the finches it's it has been", "79:08", "destroyed in some aspects and it's been", "79:10", "the habitat has been fixed in a lot of", "79:13", "places there's been great conservation", "79:15", "efforts and personally I love what", "79:17", "they're doing because they're trying to", "79:18", "keep it pristine you know I think it's", "79:20", "fantastic that there's a quarantine I", "79:21", "think it's great that I'm not supposed", "79:22", "to eat seeds for two weeks before going", "79:24", "there mm-hmm and it's it's to keep it as", "79:27", "perfect as it is now the island that I'm", "79:29", "going to with with my small team has", "79:31", "like nobody ever stepped foot on it it's", "79:33", "an active volcano that erupts every year", "79:35", "it's this crazy harsh environment we", "79:37", "have to have a new

we're", "79:46", "kind of protective gear do you have to", "79:48", "wear other than your boots just", "79:49", "long-sleeved clothing I mean if that", "79:50", "does it yet it's so the guy was telling", "79:52", "me it's like 45 degrees Celsius so", "79:54", "that's it's well over a hundred and yeah", "79:58", "and that's you know we got to be careful", "80:00", "about water and hiking and there's just", "80:02", "there's a lot of elements but that's the", "80:03", "thing is I'm looking for an animal", "80:04", "nobody's seen in a very long amount of", "80:07", "time so you got to go to these places", "80:08", "nobody's going Wow", "80:09", "that's incredible you know it's it's", "80:12", "interesting the idea of invasive species", "80:14", "too right because like Hawaii's a good", "80:17", "example", "80:18", "yeah Hawaii there's been talk of getting", "80:20", "rid of pigs yep and a lot of the natives", "80:23", "I like will slow down because if they're", "80:25", "what we hunt them we eat them right if", "80:27", "they're invasive then what are we right", "80:30", "totally the pigs were here right around", "80:31", "the same time the people were there and", "80:32", "they've we've existed together there", "80:36", "they need each other and its culture you", "80:38", "know at that point it's it's Polynesian", "80:40", "culture to eat a fire roasted pig and",

"80:57", "saying is a huge cultural significance", "80:58", "so where is the balance well one of the", "81:02", "best examples of that would be like", "81:03", "lanai because lanai has this insane", "81:06", "population of access to here we go and", "81:08", "bow hunt them there every year they're", "81:10", "delicious and yep they're plentiful and", "81:12", "it's one of the most really ethical", "81:14", "hunts cuz you have to hunt them raining", "81:16", "they they're so overpopulated there's", "81:18", "20,000 of them on an island with 3,000", "81:20", "people yep and have you ever been to", "81:22", "lanai I have yeah is diving there", "81:24", "spearfishing they're everywhere Lanice", "81:28", "it's great and they're so beautiful with", "81:30", "their spots and yeah they're amazing and", "81:31", "you know I'm all for it like hunting is", "81:34", "a tool for conservation absolutely yeah", "81:36", "but it's just bizarre that they did that", "81:38", "you have to decide to let deer loose on", "81:41", "an island with nothing to eat the deer", "81:43", "but people right and then when this is", "81:45", "done there's like King Kamehameha which", "81:47", "is what year was that I couldn't say a", "81:49", "long time ago yeah a long time ago so", "81:51", "back then they", "81:53", "you know they had guns I mean how are", "81:54", "they hunting these things back then bows", "81:56", "and Spears are probably right and and", "81:58", "they brought them over from Asia right", "82:01", "yep yep they're from Asia", "82:03", "same thing with New Zealand right", "82:04", "there's axis deer there's goats there's", "82:06", "all kinds of things but red deer there's", "82:08", "all kinds of things down there yeah", "82:10", "and same thing they're all brought in", "82:11", "for sport yeah New Zealand's a weird one", "82:14", "right so is Australia they brought a lot", "82:15", "of stuff over there from yep from Europe", "82:17", "but New Zealand specifically they were", "82:19", "trying to make it like a hunter's", "82:20", "paradise and I think it is right tell me", "82:22", "I'm wrong no it does it's a weird one", "82:24", "because it's mostly high fence you're", "82:27", "gonna love this so under my extinct", "82:29", "animal thing they took moose in the New", "82:31", "Zealand they took like ten of them small", "82:33", "population believe that they've been", "82:35", "hunted out you know they shot the last", "82:36", "one blah blah blah blah there's one guy", "82:39", "crazy lookin dude long hair long beard", "82:41", "like nuts looking guy and he's been on", "82:42", "the hunt not hunt hunt but like trying", "82:44", "to prove that the New Zealand moose is", "82:46", "still there he's found antler sheds he's", "82:48", "found bedding sites some guy even got a", "82:50", "picture of one standing on a rock and", "82:52", "you know moose to me it's 100% of moose", "82:55", "brand so they're in theory somewhere", "82:57", "down the South Island there's one or two", "82:58", "or three of these super elusive moose", "83:01", "that have been in New Zealand for like", "83:02", "50 years", "83:03", "whoa Wow well New Zealand is so fucking", "83:08", "rugged yeah there's a friend of mine has", "83:11", "been there my friend Adam green tree", "83:12", "he's been there he lives in Australia", "83:13", "and he goes there to hunt tar mm-hmm and", "83:16", "you know they live and on the steep", "83:18", "steep", "83:19", "craggy Assael where the rocks real", "83:23", "slippery and it's just like cold shit", "83:25", "and yet really high altitude and you've", "83:28", "seen them before right yeah yeah it", "83:29", "looks like a science fiction animal", "83:30", "there as that's me and my friend might", "83:33", "mean the guys I work with like to say", "83:34", "stranger than fiction you look at it and", "83:36", "you're like that's not a real creature", "83:37", "like some kid drew that yeah like a big", "83:40", "ol shaggy weird-looking things area", "83:42", "where they think they are in New Zealand", "83:44", "the moose yeah did you see that picture", "83:46", "of the one on the rock", "83:47", "yeah sticking out right yeah that's the", "83:53", "last one that was Tait last picture", "83:55", "taken oh there's 1952 there's a recent", "83:57", "one though there's one from like two or", "83:59", "three years ago and I looked at it I'm", "84:00", "like that's a moose like I don't know", "84:02", "who's saying it's not but it's a moose", "84:03", "Wow", "84:04", "yeah from 1952 mm-hmm yeah that's 100%", "84:09", "of moose right but again how weird is it", "84:12", "that there's animals that you know are", "84:13", "there and then there's animals like we", "84:15", "must find this so you spend incredible", "84:17", "amounts of time and all these resources", "84:18", "that it that's all yeah that's 100%", "84:20", "that's freaking Moo that's no doubt", "84:22", "about it see what I'm saying people yeah", "84:28", "that doesn't even make sense that", "84:29", "anybody would argue that right that's a", "84:31", "pretty clear picture but that's not", "84:32", "proof because they need genetic material", "84:34", "they need fur they need something what", "84:35", "do they think that is a cloud exactly a", "84:38", "rubber moose that someone's stuck to", "84:41", "goof on people are they like arguing", "84:42", "that somebody could a computer generated", "84:43", "it yeah rolling all those you know all", "84:46", "those and I appreciate it right as a", "84:48", "scientist I appreciate the fact that you", "84:50", "have to have proof right but it does get", "84:53", "to the point of ridiculousness", "84:54", "yeah well it's certainly possible yeah", "84:56", "it's certainly possible that they've I", "84:57", "mean especially you're looking at that", "84:58", "insanely dense terrain right you know", "85:01", "right but so there are some efforts", "85:04", "right now to try to distinct some", "85:08", "animals there are thank you yeah and", "85:12", "like what did what is currently going on", "85:14", "right now they're calling it the dawn of", "85:16", "de-extinction and it's it's a lot of", "85:21", "very very intelligent genetic scientists", "85:25", "that are trying to isolate specific", "85:27", "genes that are specific to the animals", "85:30", "that have been extinct and putting them", "85:32", "into extant animals animals that are", "85:34", "still here to basically make this", "85:36", "Frankenstein animal because it'll never", "85:39", "be the animal that's gone right it will", "85:41", "look like it'll behave like it it'll", "85:43", "think like it etc but it will never", "85:45", "actually be the animal that we've lost", "85:46", "at least not yet we haven't we don't", "85:48", "have that technology right now what we", "85:50", "can do is isolate a genome put it into", "85:52", "an existing animal that gives birth to", "85:53", "an animal that looks and acts very much", "85:55", "like the extinct animal but it's some", "85:58", "degree different because it's like part", "86:00", "like a mammoth for instance they would", "86:02", "have to take some DNA from a mammoth", "86:05", "right that they would somehow or another", "86:06", "get and introduce it to an embryo of", "86:09", "Mahomet of an elephant and then the", "86:11", "elephant would give birth to a very", "86:13", "hairy very large tusks like these", "86:15", "isolated genetic code", "86:17", "mmm elephant rain it would look like a", "86:19", "mammoth it would act like a mammoth but", "86:21", "the reality is it's a shaggy elephant", "86:23", "with big tusks right so if you did like", "86:25", "23andme on it it would show it's mostly", "86:29", "elif exactly a little bit of yeah I mean", "86:33", "if you think of a double helix like a", "86:34", "DNA strand right you have these little", "86:37", "bars in the middle of it so what they do", "86:39", "is this is a very crude way to explain", "86:41", "it but they pull out a bar from an", "86:42", "elephant and they put in a bar from a", "86:45", "mammoth and then eventually you get this", "86:47", "mammoth and so this would be like gene", "86:50", "editing tools like CRISPR exactly in", "86:52", "those lines exactly Wow and so how far", "86:55", "away are they from doing this it's I", "86:57", "mean it's been successfully done a", "86:59", "couple of times they've really yep", "87:00", "they've given birth to a couple animals", "87:02", "that are very very close to the extinct", "87:04", "animal most of the time there's problems", "87:06", "right there's it's infertile its it has", "87:10", "lung issues whatever it is there's a", "87:12", "couple different cases I'm not a", "87:13", "geneticist I'm a wildlife biologist so I", "87:15", "don't really understand it but it's", "87:17", "they've done it they have successfully", "87:20", "reproduced things that are gone", "87:21", "basically clone things and then the", "87:24", "animal hasn't made it to adulthood and", "87:26", "that seems really really like playing", "87:29", "God it is absolutely like playing God so", "87:32", "I feel like I mean are people doing it", "87:36", "just because they can is it one of those", "87:37", "things or zero like a real valid", "87:41", "scientific reason for trying to", "87:43", "reintroduce these animals or D extinct", "87:44", "them well the valid reason is to", "87:47", "conserve the ecosystem right like we", "87:49", "talked about but I think he goes back to", "87:51", "what we were saying half an hour ago", "87:53", "which is it's just that that quest for", "87:55", "knowledge that can we do it the", "87:57", "innovation right can we play God can we", "87:59", "fix it can we take this thing that's", "88:01", "gone and say no it's not like we have", "88:03", "the tools to make it not gone yeah there", "88:06", "was some article that I read where they", "88:08", "were talking about reintroducing the", "88:10", "mammoths to Siberia and that there would", "88:13", "be some ecological benefit to", "88:15", "reintroducing the mammoths because of", "88:17", "the way they forage for food they would", "88:19", "have some sort of an effect on global", "88:20", "warming I mean do you know about that I", "88:24", "don't know about that specific so you", "88:25", "can find that Jeremy the reintroducing", "88:27", "the mammoths to Siberia to benefit the", "88:30", "environment", "88:31", "look whether that's accurate or not", "88:32", "until you put mammoths on the ground how", "88:36", "do we actually know it's a great theory", "88:37", "and that's what science is right it's", "88:39", "coming up with hypotheses and then", "88:41", "trying to prove them and it sounds cool", "88:43", "like do I want to see a mammoth walking", "88:45", "around Siberia fuck yeah but does that", "88:47", "mean it's actually good for the world", "88:48", "hard to say whoa could bringing back", "88:51", "mammoths help stop climate change", "88:52", "scientists say creating hybrids of", "88:54", "extinct beasts could fix the Arctic", "88:55", "tundra and stop greenhouse gas emissions", "88:58", "don't understand that I find it hard to", "89:01", "believe to be honest maybe it's just", "89:02", "some scientists clever way of sneaking", "89:05", "it in because he wants to play God okay", "89:07", "yeah we're gonna fix everything yeah", "89:09", "fucking use coal who gives a shit", "89:11", "yeah that's that's sadly very real well", "89:19", "is it really oh yeah I mean look if", "89:21", "you're a scientist right right you Joe", "89:24", "Rogan is a scientist how are you gonna", "89:26", "make your career are you gonna make your", "89:27", "career by raising money through being", "89:28", "like yeah sure like I'll study cricket", "89:30", "legs or are you gonna be like look give", "89:33", "me the money to stop global warming by", "89:35", "bringing back fucking mammoths like", "89:36", "right you know like why you can make the", "89:39", "outrageous claim if you think it's gonna", "89:41", "fund your research right that's how you", "89:42", "make your bones right and that's that's", "89:45", "one of the sad realities of some", "89:47", "certainly not all science well mammoths", "89:49", "too are so iconic it's such a freaky", "89:53", "animal to study you know we had them", "89:55", "here", "89:55", "California Channel Islands yeah bring me", "89:57", "mammoths yeah how long ago is that I", "90:00", "want to say pre Ice Age not actually", "90:03", "sure mmm but I mean still can you", "90:05", "imagine like you know you're out fishing", "90:07", "at Catalina and you look up and there's", "90:08", "a pygmy mammoth on the cliff there's a", "90:11", "there's so many mammoth tusks in Alaska", "90:14", "in particular there's a there's an", "90:16", "Instagram page we could send it to you", "90:18", "Jamie", "90:19", "there's a page where they go and look", "90:23", "for them", "90:24", "and they they they basically use like a", "90:27", "high-pressure hose and blow them out of", "90:30", "the side of a hill it's like an eyesore", "90:33", "is it in like earth it's an earth yeah", "90:37", "okay the boneyard Alaska is the", "90:40", "Instagram page if you go to the boneyard", "90:42", "Alaska you'll see", "90:44", "what I'm talking about it's fucking", "90:46", "incredible I mean they keep pulling", "90:47", "these they're using these hoses and", "90:49", "cleaning off this dirt and they're", "90:51", "pulling these intact tusks that's insane", "90:54", "if it must have been so many of them", "90:55", "that died and they're preserving whether", "90:57", "it's mudslides or ever and they get", "90:59", "preserved under these things there's", "91:00", "this one pocket where they're all", "91:02", "concentrated well they're parently they", "91:03", "find quite a bit of them that's not yeah", "91:05", "any one of those in the in the studio", "91:07", "mammoth tusks yeah man seems like like", "91:14", "ivory yeah yeah you don't want to add", "91:16", "some rich assholes house totally what is", "91:17", "that a cigar with skull Oh", "91:20", "short-faced bear skull hole fuck that's", "91:23", "a cool animal that's a cool animal yeah", "91:25", "we've we've drooled over those banks", "91:28", "many times on the podcast", "91:29", "see right there you see those tusks oh", "91:31", "yeah those are tough laugh but yeah", "91:33", "bottom line right there", "91:34", "those are some tough that they pulled", "91:36", "out that's nuts yeah there's a ton of", "91:38", "them man I mean these guys these guys", "91:40", "are constantly doing this and pulling", "91:42", "these things out so let me ask you", "91:44", "you're hiking through there right you're", "91:45", "uh you're on a hike or a hunt or", "91:47", "whatever you stub your toe on one what", "91:49", "do you do you dig it out and put on your", "91:50", "pack leave it", "91:52", "take a picture what do you do I don't", "91:53", "know what the rules are like if you're", "91:55", "in certain places and you find an", "91:57", "arrowhead you're supposed to leave it", "91:58", "but rules aside like ethically what do", "92:01", "you do well it depends on how far away", "92:04", "you are right because they're you that's", "92:06", "a lot of weight said that's that's fair", "92:08", "that's fair let's say you mark it a mark", "92:10", "a pin on a GPS and come back because", "92:12", "it's like it's something you want right", "92:14", "as a human being it's a treasure like", "92:15", "you found this incredible thing but", "92:17", "ethically you should probably shouldn't", "92:19", "touch it you know what do you do well", "92:21", "these guys obviously know what they're", "92:22", "doing right for me I would I mean if", "92:25", "look at that one oh my god that's crazy", "92:28", "it is you'd wrap it up with tape is that", "92:31", "what they did there to like it looks", "92:33", "like all those metal thing to hand it", "92:35", "together sort of I like to keep it from", "92:36", "falling apart maybe as they pull it out", "92:38", "of the water or the other dirt rather um", "92:41", "if I was thinking of my best me yeah the", "92:44", "best me would mark a pin and then alert", "92:47", "status and tell them where it is and", "92:50", "leave it the fuck alone don't be a", "92:51", "greedy dick so what happens in our", "92:52", "spring cut I dig that bitch out and put", "92:56", "pack right not tell anybody and bring it", "92:58", "back home I just don't know what the law", "92:59", "is sure and even beyond the law like", "93:02", "here's this gentleman right here it's", "93:03", "pulling this out even if you don't know", "93:06", "what the law is what's what's right", "93:08", "that's the question right what's right", "93:10", "what's the right thing to do yeah there", "93:11", "might not be a good law yet right but", "93:13", "there might be if I mean there clearly", "93:15", "is a finite number of these things of", "93:17", "course there has to be and they're", "93:19", "prehistoric now let me let me pose this", "93:21", "to you so I know a guy is treasure", "93:23", "hunter by trade very cool old guy", "93:24", "Australian guy lived in Perth and for",

we're seeing and moving and", "110:26", "changing and and we're always finding", "110:27", "new ones like I found a fucking snake I", "110:30", "posted it up on on Twitter like a week", "110:33", "or so ago a snake that has a tail that", "110:37", "looks like a fake spider mm-hmm have you", "110:39", "seen that fucking thing I'm not sure", "110:41", "what do you know the species of it I",

that and", "111:20", "then that amount of camouflage and", "111:22", "adaptation like how does that happen", "111:24", "it's incredible this it's boom oh got", "111:28", "you bitch dunzo", "111:29",

"111:54", "right and then over generational time", "111:57", "this tail evolved little spikes and", "111:59", "little things and all of a sudden you", "112:01", "have this whole population of animals", "112:03", "that look like that like that's a what", "112:04", "is it how the fuck does that happen I", "112:07", "mean how does something grow something", "112:08", "like that allure right grows a lure off", "112:11", "of its head I was like hey look it's", "112:13", "something for you oh my god it's got a", "112:18", "worm I mean that thing literally has a", "112:20", "like a fishing worm like a bass worm I", "112:23", "mean it's it's so amazing all of this", "112:26", "adaptation and all of these look at that", "112:29", "fucking monster with a light groan and", "112:32", "it's got a flashlight on her head but", "112:34", "just it's so amazing how much adaptation", "112:36", "there is and how all these things sort", "112:39", "of work together right like there's the",

I", "113:06", "find it so interesting now when you", "113:09", "study these things and do you ever try", "113:11", "to think like how the fuck that happened", "113:14", "like you see that that spider tailed", "113:16", "snake is there anyone that has like an", "113:19", "idea like that this was you know this", "113:22", "was just a lucky break that this one", "113:24", "snake had a freaky tail and then he got", "113:26", "the fuck a lot doesn't eat a lot of", "113:28", "birds that's the idea man you just I", "113:30", "swear to God you just summed it up like", "113:32", "that is the idea one or two or three", "113:33", "snakes kind of got this adaptation just", "113:37", "a random random genetic sequencing that", "113:39", "led to maybe a white watch on the tail", "113:41", "something unique doesn't it not seem", "113:43", "like that though it seems like they", "113:45", "fashioned it but over time over they did", "113:48", "but over millennia right over thousands", "113:50", "or tens of thousands or hundreds of", "113:52", "thousands of years the one what happened", "113:54", "was say there's two snakes with a white", "113:55", "spot on their tail then they have a baby", "113:57", "and it has little bit of deformation", "113:59", "right a little thing sticking out then", "114:02", "that snake all of a sudden catches more", "114:03", "birds than the rest of the snakes that",

animals to", "114:14", "reproduce with to continue the gene pool", "114:16", "and so that's what happens it keeps", "114:19", "evolving it's like a peacock right this", "114:21", "crazy big tail that it's attracting", "114:23", "mates with it's not useful to the bird", "114:25", "you know that's entirely made for", "114:27", "showmanship for peacocking if you will", "114:29", "and it over generational time it gets", "114:32", "bigger and crazier and more elaborate", "114:34", "more colorful and the females literally", "114:36", "flock to them and that's the animal that", "114:38", "continues on what I really wish there", "114:41", "was a way and maybe there will be some", "114:42", "time in the future where they're going", "114:44", "to be able to show you with like some", "114:45", "sort of supercomputer sequencing where", "114:48", "they'll be able to look at the DNA of", "114:50", "this thing and say oh this is the exact", "114:52", "progression right this is what it", "114:53", "started off with and this is what it", "114:54", "became right this is how some sketchy", "114:56", "looking forest chicken became a peacock", "114:58", "totally you know this is how some freaky", "115:01", "snake became perfectly adapted to its", "115:04", "environment I mean that thing looks", "115:05", "exactly like the rock that it's on it's", "115:08", "perfect yeah since it is in crowd", "115:10", "like I would I'm like you I'd love to", "115:12", "know who patient zero is you know who's", "115:14", "the who's the first one", "115:16", "yeah because stupid people like me look", "115:17", "at that and they go okay well that's got", "115:19", "to be a plan there's something there's a", "115:20", "higher power this is something that like", "115:22", "is looking after this things and writing", "115:24", "them making them evolve this way right", "115:26", "right it's no I mean it's it's super", "115:29", "interesting what about like cephalopods", "115:32", "like octopus and cuttlefish and the way", "115:35", "they adapt their environment that's even", "115:37", "freakier right they do it", "115:38", "instantaneously and have you ever heard", "115:40", "the theory that octopus are from out of", "115:42", "space yeah we talked about that with", "115:43", "Brian Cox the other day yeah I'm not I'm", "115:45", "not super well-read on it yeah like it", "115:48", "looks like a damn alien yeah he was very", "115:50", "incredulous but you know he's obviously", "115:52", "it's more than both of us right yeah", "115:57", "it's like me looking at tackling that it", "115:59", "doesn't make sense that of course it", "116:00", "doesn't make sense I'm stupid correctly", "116:02", "he's he's you know when we're looking at", "116:04", "this I but this is apparently like", "116:05", "peer-reviewed published paper about the", "116:08", "possibility of octopus being reintroduce", "116:14", "right on them right I know I don't", "116:16", "understand it well but yes it's like the", "116:18", "thought that the population came from", "116:20", "out of space because the DNA sequence II", "116:22", "and suggest something that makes it", "116:25", "extraterrestrial adaptability yeah he", "116:27", "was super skeptical because he was", "116:28", "saying that they're essentially so close", "116:30", "to everything else here right it doesn't", "116:32", "make sense but the other theory was it", "116:34", "might be just this is the path of life", "116:36", "right and the reason why it's so close", "116:37", "to us is that this is the way all life", "116:39", "even if it's extraterrestrial sure gets", "116:42", "established sure I just I don't believe", "116:44", "octopus from out of space but I love the", "116:46", "theory I love the idea of it it looks", "116:47", "like it's from outer space you know it's", "116:49", "just wacky well it's such a cool thought", "116:51", "yeah you know things came from out of", "116:54", "spaces so well that's also a thought", "116:56", "about psilocybin mushrooms from the", "116:58", "weirder people that they came on", "117:00", "asteroids and spores I've heard that", "117:02", "yeah and they've I don't know if you", "117:03", "know this but they've proven that", "117:05", "certain I don't know about psilocybin", "117:06", "but certain mushroom spores are", "117:08", "impenetrable to the vacuum of space yeah", "117:10", "they can survive yeah that's bananas I", "117:13", "pick a lot of mushrooms not psilocybin", "117:15", "but a lot of porcini a lot of", "117:17", "chanterelles like I do a lot of foraging", "117:20", "it's really fun are you aware of Paul", "117:22", "Stamets no I don't know he's", "117:24", "amazing one of my favorite podcasts ever", "117:27", "he's a mycologist a fucking trip in", "117:31", "every sense of the word huh a", "117:32", "supergenius mycologist whoo the craziest", "117:36", "story about being in high school and", "117:37", "what do you say took 20 grams of", "117:39", "mushrooms and on to tree a lightning", "117:41", "storm but something fucking it's", "117:44", "something where you hear him tell the", "117:45", "story your hands start sweating away he", "117:47", "grabs 10 grams or 20 grams like", "117:50", "something fucking bananas like something", "117:52", "that would kill moose yeah well it", "117:53", "wouldn't kill it but it would definitely", "117:54", "make it think it's not a moose anymore", "117:56", "right and and it essentially changed his", "117:59", "life stopped him from stuttering he used", "118:00", "to stutter and he did this and he", "118:01", "stopped stuff no way yeah I've heard", "118:03", "about guys that microdose with mushrooms", "118:06", "with psilocybin and it heightens their", "118:09", "focus and curse or autism and you know", "118:12", "there's I'm not very well-read on that", "118:14", "but there's a whole idea that micro", "118:16", "dosing with these chemicals that are", "118:18", "naturally produced can actually have", "118:20", "very positive effects yeah there's quite", "118:23", "a few people do that the only common", "118:24", "yeah yeah I've talked to a lot of people", "118:26", "that do that it really goes with that", "118:28", "and they also micro dose of the LSD", "118:29", "there's a lot you have a lot of Silicon", "118:31", "Valley people are micro dosing with LSD", "118:33", "it's funny cuz the one person that I", "118:35", "know that's done the micro desing with", "118:36", "mushrooms from Silicon Valley yeah", "118:37", "people grind them up into pill form and", "118:40", "and in fact a lot of Fighters are doing", "118:42", "that now really strange yeah so what", "118:44", "would that why would that help you like", "118:46", "as a fighter is it it's not a mental", "118:48", "focus thing it's a it's a physical thing", "118:49", "at that point right well it's gets you", "118:51", "into the flow state interesting and so", "118:54", "like with fighters the real thing is", "118:57", "it's not just your skill but it's your", "119:00", "ability to execute that skill under", "119:01", "pressure alright so there's an", "119:03",

thing", "119:29", "it's not just that though the", "119:30", "consequences of it possibly go wrong", "119:32", "make you hesitate and it just it's it's", "119:35", "the stress of it all this very", "119:38", "strictly it's very difficult to operate", "119:39", "under that stress sure the mushrooms for", "119:42", "some people alleviate that stress and", "119:44", "put you in this elevated state where", "119:47", "they say and I haven't I've never fought", "119:50", "on mushrooms but they say that when", "119:52", "you're on mushrooms you actually can see", "119:54", "what a guy's gonna do before he does it", "119:56", "interest yeah you have a sense of what", "119:58", "they're gonna do that's a much more", "119:59", "heightened sense than you would if you", "120:01", "were just in a normal silver state", "120:03", "so are you pickin do you think you're", "120:04", "picking that up through like biological", "120:06", "cues like you could see the muscles", "120:07", "twitching in the arm before the punch", "120:09", "comes or like what how do you think", "120:10", "that's a good question they've done it I", "120:12", "don't know you know I've never sparred", "120:14", "on mushrooms or sound like a good idea", "120:16", "but that's really common they say it is", "120:18", "a good idea the guys who do it love it", "120:21", "yeah interest and guys have like you", "120:23", "know had some real extreme positive", "120:25", "results huh yeah that's fascinating I", "120:28", "never thought as an athletic performer", "120:30", "that athletic enhancement that would be", "120:32", "a thing yeah it's it's not just the no I", "120:35", "don't think it makes you move faster or", "120:38", "hit stronger or hit harder but I think", "120:40", "what it does is it puts you in the zone", "120:42", "interesting there's there's states that", "120:44", "you get into where you just you can't do", "120:47", "no wrong and these are usually very", "120:49", "elusive they come and they go", "120:51", "you know you get them like do you ever", "120:53", "play pool I did a little bit I mean but", "120:55", "you know how sometimes you play pool for", "120:56", "a few hours and then you just awesome", "120:58", "yeah you just have this feeling of where", "121:00", "everything's gonna go that's even if", "121:02", "you're not very good sometimes those", "121:04", "little conflict to tree shots at", "121:05", "sheriff's the zone sure you know and", "121:07", "that elusive state of like RIT and then", "121:11", "sometimes you're like wow I can't", "121:12", "believe I'm in the zone then it goes", "121:13", "away right you know right maintaining", "121:16", "that flow state what do you think it", "121:18", "takes emotions out of it like is that is", "121:20", "that why you're in that state like if", "121:22", "you're not emotionally attached to that", "121:23", "shot or that punch maybe you can execute", "121:26", "it better it's possible I mean there's a", "121:28", "lot of speculation of what's going on", "121:30", "right what's causing this elevated state", "121:32", "of consciousness it's interesting yeah I", "121:34", "don't know I'll just start micro dosing", "121:36", "on mushrooms and going out che snakes", "121:37", "around maybe like maybe you have you", "121:39", "like more in tune with the environment", "121:41", "or maybe I get bitten and - that's true", "121:43", "- really hello to the snake yeah", "121:46", "fuck you you are okay so I'm not I'm not", "121:49", "like a big drug guy by any means but I", "121:50", "think you'll love this story on this", "121:53", "amazon trip I told you about we land in", "121:55", "this airstrip and then this plane we", "121:56", "meet we get into this village and I'm", "121:58", "like cool boats have made it here it", "121:59", "took the boats five days we're gonna", "122:00", "head upriver right and are like", "122:03", "translators like you can't do that yet", "122:04", "what do you mean like we've spent months", "122:06", "planning this he's like you have to have", "122:08", "the shamans blessing to go upriver and", "122:10", "I'm like okay what does that mean he's", "122:12",
