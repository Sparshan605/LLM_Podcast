trespass or for", "07:12", "loitering", "07:12", "and then the aclu actually sued and they", "07:14", "said that this is a violation of", "07:15", "people's personal property", "07:16", "oh and the courts tell you you do such", "07:18", "good work sometimes and the court's", "07:20", "ruled that you actually are not allowed", "07:21", "to move people's stuff that that's", "07:22", "actually personal property", "07:24", "even though it's in a public area and", "07:25", "then they got a ruling from a court that", "07:26", "you're allowed to live in your car", "07:27", "because for a while you weren't allowed", "07:28", "to live in your car and then it was", "07:29", "you're allowed to live in your car", "07:30", "so now you're basically allowed to leave", "07:32", "your stuff on the sidewalk and the", "07:33", "police are not allowed to move it", "07:34", "and you're allowed to live in your car", "07:36", "and then", "07:37", "there was this sort of equity movement", "07:39",

changed", "11:40", "and yet it immediately turned into who", "11:42", "can we blame who's who's to blame for", "11:44", "all these dead people maybe it's ron", "11:45", "desantis or maybe it's cuomo like who", "11:47", "who can we blame so that was terrible", "11:48", "and then on the floyd stuff", "11:49", "i had the same feelings like i don't", "11:51", "know a single human being who watched",

actually really", "21:39", "the the biggest problem right now on the", "21:41", "racism point is the shifting definition", "21:43", "of racism", "21:44", "so i had the unfortunate experience of",

side", "47:41", "is that it's they're accountable now", "47:44", "and this has been going on forever if", "47:46", "you talk to people that are black that", "47:47", "grew up in", "47:48", "in poverty
