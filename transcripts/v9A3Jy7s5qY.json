controller", "18:00", "that's called a a four one nine it'll", "18:03", "keep the temperature of the refrigerator", "18:05", "about 34 to 38 degrees so rather than", "18:07", "plugging the

fridge and then you take all your", "18:15", "meat and you lay it out on grates in the", "18:17", "refrigerator and I left it in there for", "18:19", "about three weeks this scrub cow and it",

control", "18:41", "the the temperature you want about 34 to", "18:44", "38 degrees and then the humidity can", "18:46", "vary a lot more than that but I kept the", "18:48", "humidity at about 60 to 70 degrees and", "18:50", "then basically you just slice off all", "18:52", "that hard grisly external coating and", "18:55", "you've got this amazing me I'm a super", "18:57", "soft super tender and

size and so so the the", "19:41", "food is on grates inside the", "19:43", "refrigerator yeah so I took all the", "19:45", "shelving out of the refrigerator and I", "19:47", "just put some plywood on", "19:48", "other side of the refrigerator and I put", "19:50", "these metal grates oh so you constructed", "19:52", "your own right exactly then just laid", "19:53", "the meat down on the grates

make a fist with one", "22:21", "hand then you shake their hand you're", "22:23", "stronger you know and that's that's", "22:24", "something that Pablo's at Selene talks", "22:26", "about his books you know about how to", "22:28", "generate as much force as possible right", "22:30", "for as low as one fist I mean if you're", "22:32", "gonna do like a bottoms-up kettlebell", "22:33", "press right

you hold", "23:19", "your breath you go - doing that same", "23:22", "thing it tightens up every yeah and", "23:23", "allows you to produce more force the the", "23:27", "other gum you mentioned the bazooka", "23:29", "there's a gum called mastic gum and I", "23:31", "interview this guy Dean Karnazes who run", "23:33", "it he did the 50 marathons in 50 days", "23:35", "and he ran the the traditional marathon", "23:38", "in Greece which is apparently not 26.2", "23:40", "miles it's like a hundred and some miles", "23:42", "that he ran and he would chew this", "23:44", "mastic gum which

a lot of times you get you", "23:54", "know be thinking about food you want to", "23:56", "eat this mastic gum apparently keeps", "23:58", "your appetite satiated and allows you to", "23:59", "produce saliva and I bought some and", "24:01", "it's you can find that shit it's a I", "24:03", "think I got it mastic gum Amazon helps", "24:06", "Greeks of mastic gum yeah that's what it", "24:10", "looks like Little Rock's", "24:11", "and the interesting thing is is you can", "24:13", "take it out after you're done chewing", "24:15", "and then just like the next day put it", "24:17", "back in your mouth and keep you can chew", "24:19", "that stuff for days it's like a like an", "24:21", "Everlasting Gobstopper tastes like it", "24:23", "tastes like ass that's not that good but", "24:26", "if you have this this h pylori issue", "24:29", "it's supposedly very good for that yeah", "24:31", "look that wasn't bad", "24:32", "they had a licorice anise E and a fennel", "24:35", "so it tastes even shittier yeah but but", "24:38", "it's supposedly", "24:39", "you know this idea that we grow up on", "24:41", "soft food and babies eat eat soft food", "24:44", "yeah you wouldn't want the capsule that", "24:45", "would I mean the capsule would be good", "24:47", "for your that's where you got to be", "24:48", "careful as a lot of companies sell it as", "24:50", "a capsule right as mastic gum as a", "24:52", "capsule but um the each one that's the", "24:54", "exact one I have that Cree knows say", "24:57", "there's mastic ground yeah yeah and", "25:00", "that's that's the stuff that you", "25:01", "actually chew hmm to make your jaw", "25:03", "stronger hmm and to produce extra saliva", "25:07", "huh and do you use this stuff where you", "25:09", "work out are you just occasionally", "25:11", "chewing no I don't like to have gum like", "25:13", "you have so many different things going", "25:15", "on so many different modalities that", "25:17", "you're experimenting with there's no way", "25:18", "you can spits that's my stick that's", "25:20", "what that's what I do is I try stuff and", "25:22", "I write about it it's not like it's not", "25:24", "like I'm doing mastic gum and black cap", "25:26", "powder I know and injections all day", "25:28", "long um works yeah I would think you'd", "25:32", "keep doing it all the time but it's just", "25:33", "like you forget about a lot of stuff", "25:35", "though you try out so many things you", "25:37", "forget about it yeah I tried that out a", "25:38", "while ago it's pretty good I need to", "25:40", "order some more of that so yeah you", "25:41", "start to lose track of all the stuff I", "25:43", "try I don't have it all systematized of", "25:45", "some big Excel spreadsheet what are you", "25:47", "doing with the exomes explain that", "25:48", "because I just got some shot into some", "25:51", "tears that I have in my shoulders you", "25:53", "know it's exosomes exosomes they're", "25:58", "signaling molecules so your body", "26:01", "actually has them your cells have", "26:02", "exosomes and they're used as cell to", "26:04", "cell communicators", "26:05", "so they interact with cell surface", "26:07", "receptors and they'll actually carry a", "26:09", "message from one cell to another such as", "26:11", "you know you need you need to absorb", "26:14", "this into the cell you need to carry", "26:16", "this to a joint or you know whatever", "26:18", "you'd want to use an exosome for to", "26:20", "carry messages throughout the body it's", "26:21", "part of your believers referred to as", "26:23", "the paracrine system your body's", "26:25", "internal cellular communication system", "26:27", "so the idea", "26:29", "is that if you combined the exosomes", "26:32", "with other therapies let like", "26:34", "platelet-rich plasma injections which", "26:37", "you do for it to increase the amount of", "26:39", "growth fast whether they did to a", "26:40", "specific joint they did exosomes plus", "26:42", "PRP with you right which I I can I can", "26:46", "tell you the full procedure that I did", "26:47", "but I just got that all over my face my", "26:49", "face five days ago was red and swollen", "26:51", "because it was covered with exosomes", "26:53", "lights your questions it's a it's a", "26:56", "beauty procedure beautiful as you are", "26:58", "thank you thank you but now I'm a", "27:00", "beautiful thirteen year old so the the", "27:06", "exosomes can be combined with other", "27:08", "things like PRP and also with stem cells", "27:11", "or with bone marrow and that's what I", "27:14", "did and the interesting thing is that", "27:16", "you can get something like a placental", "27:21", "cell alright and in my case they", "27:23", "actually took placental cells from this", "27:25", "lab called chimera labs I had this", "27:27", "procedure done in Park City Utah it's", "27:29", "guy named dr. Harry Adelson and he he", "27:32", "had these placental cells from chimera", "27:34", "labs they destroy the placental cell so", "27:38", "that there's no actual DNA from some", "27:41", "other person that you're putting into", "27:43", "your body right which is which is the", "27:45", "that's considered to be part of the risk", "27:47", "of stem cells even umbilical or amniotic", "27:49", "you're still getting somebody else's DNA", "27:52", "into your body not your own DNA so the", "27:54", "idea is that you would take exosomes", "27:56", "that you've isolated from something like", "27:58", "a placental tissue and then you would", "28:01", "mix those with your own stem cells in", "28:04", "this case what I used was was bone", "28:06", "marrow aspirate they went into both of", "28:09", "my iliac crests they took out the bone", "28:11", "marrow they mixed it with the exosomes", "28:13", "and and these videos I published both of", "28:15", "the videos on YouTube and and it's like", "28:17", "a it's like a huge syringe fold I'm", "28:22", "gonna see the drawing on my hip how much", "28:24", "bone marrow they've taken out of your", "28:25", "head a lot I was well I was out you know", "28:27", "I was heavily sedated during the entire", "28:28", "procedure", "28:29", "well not heavily stemming I was under", "28:31", "who wasn't general anesthesia", "28:33", "it's called full-body sedation so you're", "28:35", "similar to general anesthesia with few", "28:38", "of the risks of the actual anesthesia I", "28:40", "was not conscious", "28:42", "nothing I mean all I remember is they", "28:43", "said count from 100 down to zero and I", "28:46", "got to like 93 and then I woke up yeah", "28:48", "exactly", "28:49", "so they took the bone marrow from the", "28:52", "iliac crest right which is just like", "28:54", "bone broth for your whole body's got", "28:56", "College and this got peptides it's got", "28:58", "stem cells they mix it with the exosomes", "29:00", "which act as cell communicators from", "29:04", "those placental cells this place called", "29:06", "chimera Labs which in my opinion it's", "29:08", "just a great sexy name for some kind of", "29:10", "a mysterious lab company where you buy", "29:12", "placentas so basically they they mix the", "29:15", "exosomes", "29:16", "with the bone marrow and then what they", "29:18", "did you are oh yeah see that's what", "29:20", "let's see whereas that crest you asked", "29:24", "me how much they took how much they're", "29:25", "pulling out holy shit but he did that", "29:29", "like four times cuz he did twice - are", "29:32", "you fucking shitting me this was five", "29:34", "days ago he told me I was supposed to", "29:36", "not do anything for two weeks but did", "29:37", "that Spartan Race I armored myself up", "29:40", "why didn't it well I I was signed up for", "29:45", "the race and I had sponsor obligations", "29:47", "actually not sponsored by use like four", "29:54",

"30:02", "what is rock tape and kinesio tape", "30:04", "you've seen this stuff before it's like", "30:06", "what you see crossfitter supports it", "30:10", "supports the joints", "30:11", "oh Jesus they're going in for another", "30:13", "tube four of those four of those big", "30:16", "tubes", "30:17", "Jamie's do you think you have in your", "30:19", "body you think you have four tubes of", "30:21", "marrow", "30:21", "floating around some I could pull out of", "30:23", "you yeah but well the tubes also you", "30:26", "know this when you gives like you can", "30:28", "give like 19 tubes of blood but it's not", "30:30", "as much blood as it actually looks like", "30:31", "because it's inside of that little", "30:33", "skinny tube right so he and his partners", "30:36", "like quite a lot what they did was he", "30:38", "went with with that bone marrow mixed", "30:42", "with the exosomes they mix it with ozone", "30:43", "which apparently using an ozonator which", "30:46", "apparently increases the efficacy of the", "30:48", "bone marrow and you're doing this for a", "30:49", "no specific injury no specific injury no", "30:53", "this is all just for", "30:55", "over two reasons number one anti-aging", "30:57", "number two just immersive journalism", "30:59", "just to write about I think this stuff's", "31:01", "fun to write about looking at in a study", "31:03", "so and apparently the stem cells stay", "31:06", "valves so into is this this is an", "31:08", "over-exaggeration but it's almost like", "31:09", "he'd be like wolverine or like you", "31:10", "recover

going for a", "42:14", "long time in between your feedings right", "42:17", "so so the idea is you know you'd wake up", "42:20", "and in the population for which this", "42:23", "seems to be the most

of", "44:04", "those big steaks every single night for", "44:08", "dinner just like a bunch of steak every", "44:09", "single night for dinner problem and this", "44:12", "is like ten days how'd you

days", "45:37", "especially for an athlete you could", "45:39", "still intermittent fast and get all the", "45:41", "benefits of that and you could still eat", "45:43", "as many calories as you would mean to", "45:45", "sustain a normal healthy metabolism all", "45:47", "right so so you're not starving yourself", "45:49", "but on the less active days you would", "45:51", "shift to a lower protein

you asking to 0.7 to", "46:01", "0.85 grams per pound of body weight", "46:04", "right so so there's some days where your", "46:06", "high protein some days where your low", "46:07", "protein some periods of the week such as", "46:10", "a meatless Monday or some periods of the", "46:12", "year you know such as every quarter you", "46:14", "know for a week where you're eating a", "46:16",
