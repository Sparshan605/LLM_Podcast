get into this the ufc program is", "07:47", "not the only program that's seen this", "07:49", "there's another professional sports", "07:50", "league", "07:51", "that has seen it very frequently

hiding", "08:04", "in the fat tissues surrounding organs", "08:06", "and maybe", "08:07", "have a pulsing effect where it's", "08:09", "released at certain times", "08:10", "and other times you can't

not", "08:28", "performance enhancing drugs they're the", "08:30", "result of the breakdown of the parent", "08:31", "drug", "08:32", "in the body now what how much time is it", "08:35", "detectable the actual drug itself", "08:38", "so pretty quick uh it's a pretty quick", "08:40", "clearance time i think rochenkov's study", "08:42", "says", "08:42", "you know maybe a week uh so it's not", "08:44", "around for very long and that's why he", "08:46", "conducted the study", "08:48", "ironically enough and i was gonna go", "08:49", "watch icarus here", "08:51", "last night and i just i've had too much", "08:53", "going on the last week to kind of", "08:54", "refresh my mind but", "08:56", "um apparently he he knew this was part", "08:59", "of his protocol for russian athletes", "09:01", "he knew a coach that was still giving", "09:03", "the oral tarini ball to russian athletes", "09:05", "and he had a falling out with a coach so", "09:08", "he goes off on the side", "09:09",

out what stays", "09:17", "around and leaves markers in the body", "09:19", "for a long time and so he developed", "09:21", "these short and long-term metabolite", "09:23", "tests and was able to catch some of this", "09:25", "coach's", "09:26", "athletes for using the oral tyrannoball", "09:28", "interesting", "09:29", "so the actual drug itself is gone from", "09:31", "the system but the

like 18 months yeah so", "09:41", "here here's the initial here's the", "09:42", "proposed initial ingestion", "09:44", "yep because my question is these same", "09:46", "long-term metabolites", "09:48", "these existed a year plus ago it was", "09:51", "more than a year", "09:52", "how long ago that that's the so july", "09:54", "2017 was your initial test so with all", "09:57", "the experts and we'll get through this", "09:58", "what all the experts are telling us", "10:00", "is there's no evidence of re-ingestion", "10:04", "and most likely this is still remnants", "10:06", "from", "10:07", "the july 2017 test however it was to", "10:10", "enter into a system", "10:12", "and we'll go through some of these", "10:13", "testing numbers that have shown", "10:15", "negatives followed by", "10:16", "very low level pico grant picograms the", "10:19", "question though was", "10:20", "that the the ingestion that happened", "10:23", "that he tested positive for in july of", "10:25", "2017 indicated a long-term", "10:28", "effect right it was a long-term", "10:30", "long-term metabolic correct", "10:31", "so meaning it had already been in his", "10:33", "system for a year or so it absolutely", "10:35", "could have predated", "10:36", "you know the theory the first time", "10:38", "through was something had to have", "10:39", "entered his system between july 7th", "10:41", "and july 8th those negatives and this", "10:43", "low picogram", "10:44", "reading on july 28th over this last year", "10:48", "there's been a lot of study into this", "10:49", "long-term metabolite as i mentioned", "10:51", "this isn't just a ufc issue there's", "10:53", "another major professional sports league", "10:55", "that", "10:56", "for the time being wants to keep their", "10:58", "their

effect over a year where you'd", "11:08", "see but this is positive well over a", "11:10", "year", "11:11", "we're talking two and a half years now", "11:13", "right if it's a year if", "11:14", "if it's a if in july he would july 2017.", "11:18", "we're talking a year and a half right", "11:19", "july 2017", "11:21", "july 17 but it could have been in his", "11:23", "system a year prior i don't know", "11:25", "yeah it could have been a couple months", "11:27", "a year i don't know he had never showed", "11:28", "up for that m3 metabolite for he had", "11:30", "been tested", "11:31", "you know for it he had been tested", "11:33", "multiple times in the program correct me", "11:35", "from wrong", "11:35", "isn't the same level isn't it", "11:38", "approximately the same picograms", "11:40", "that exist today in 2018", "11:43", "that were there in 2017 generally if you", "11:47", "look and we can go over these numbers it", "11:49", "it fluctuates", "11:50", "you know from single digits it never", "11:52", "gets into triple digits to", "11:53", "to mid double digits so there's some as", "11:55", "low as nine picograms over that time", "11:58", "um there was some at 60 picograms let's", "12:00", "explain a picogram to someone because", "12:02", "it's a preposterous", "12:03", "small it's insane and you know the the", "12:06", "analogy that i heard early on was", "12:08", "and i think john used this throw a pinch", "12:10", "of salt an olympic swimming pool and i'm", "12:12", "like okay well that's", "12:14", "you kind of wrap your head around now", "12:15",

a picogram so one grain of", "12:25", "salt", "12:25", "and we all know what that looks like", "12:26", "right you put that in front of you", "12:28", "and you split that and i mentioned this", "12:31", "week 50 million it's actually", "12:32", "58 million if you split that 58 million", "12:35", "times a grain of salt", "12:37", "each one is a picogram i mean it's", "12:39",

"he's gone from and i'll", "12:51", "read through it here so here's here's", "12:53", "since the initial appearance of the m3", "12:55", "metabolite here's what john's", "12:58", "tests look like in those picogram", "12:59", "readings so the first one was collection", "13:02", "date was july 28", "13:03", "2017. he had a concentration", "13:07", "of 80 picograms however let me caution", "13:11", "and i'll read something from from an", "13:12", "expert", "13:13", "when you get down to these picogram", "13:15", "levels", "13:16", "the science is somewhat inexact because", "13:19", "it's such",

just", "20:18", "yeah it's it's absolutely a theory i", "20:20", "don't you know i i i can't sit here and", "20:22", "said that happen but i will have heard", "20:23", "similar things i have heard

the time period", "21:17", "he's talking about that the athlete", "21:19", "admitted", "21:20", "um that prior to and for a period of", "21:23", "time", "21:24", "after the reporting of a second

"22:34", "there are studies not necessarily with", "22:36", "this but", "22:37", "another substance clomiphene and look i", "22:39", "want that while i'm cautioning people", "22:41", "to be careful

know i think 25", "23:32", "milligrams a day", "23:33", "and then had them get off and then", "23:36", "continue to look at their urine up to", "23:38", "261 days after", "23:40", "and what you saw

test", "26:11", "it well i mean someone could try it with", "26:13", "something else but it the reason you", "26:15", "microdose", "26:16", "with endogenous substances is they're", "26:18", "already

right you deserve", "56:09", "to to have time served at the time of", "56:11", "that arbitration", "56:13", "so again i think that's a good example", "56:14", "of the checks and balances", "56:16",

in the reality", "56:43", "in the real world is that doesn't", "56:44", "necessarily happen and that's why you", "56:46", "have these checks and balances", "56:47", "available um josh barnett's take on the", "56:50", "matter", "56:51", "is that they tried to paint him as", "56:53", "guilty even though he was not", "56:54", "and that he he feels like he definitely", "56:57", "got a bad deal",

and although he was found", "57:07", "not guilty that he feels like not enough", "57:10", "emphasis was", "57:12", "put into establishing that he was not", "57:14", "guilty and that", "57:16", "you know he he feels like they chased", "57:18", "him down over something that he didn't", "57:20", "do", "57:20", "yeah i mean well here's what he did do", "57:22", "is he used a supplement that",

how it was", "57:48", "marketed", "57:49", "i said okay well that's that's likely", "57:50", "the candidate of where it came from", "57:52", "yeah so i mean the analysis would be hey", "57:55", "you know", "57:55", "that pool be careful there's sharks", "57:57", "swimming in that pool they can eat you", "58:00", "and the person jumps in the water anyway", "58:01", "saying look i didn't want to get eaten", "58:03", "by a shark but a shark comes up and ate", "58:05", "them it's like", "58:06", "hey we told you that this was the case", "58:08", "you didn't follow that now", "58:09", "there also needs to be a differentiation", "58:11", "between someone who's intentional", "58:13", "cheating intentionally cheating", "58:15", "and someone that's just you know makes a", "58:17", "naive", "58:19", "supplement choice there there needs to", "58:21", "be a differentiation between that and", "58:22", "there was in that case", "58:23", "josh didn't get you know the full", "58:26", "penalty of what was", "58:28", "what that substance you know would have", "58:29", "rendered but he did have to go through a", "58:31", "long", "58:31", "period of time where he was unable to", "58:33",

did that give", "58:44", "you a performance enhancing benefit did", "58:46", "it allow you to recover a little bit", "58:47", "better", "58:48", "did it make you a little bit stronger", "58:50", "and you know that's why those strict", "58:52", "liability provisions are in there", "58:54", "otherwise people would just take these", "58:55", "prohibited supplements and say oh i", "58:57", "didn't know", "58:57", "exactly it was an accident exactly", "58:59", "meanwhile they're getting a benefit", "59:00", "exactly so they have to have some sort", "59:02", "of penalty in place", "59:04", "i think so now i also think again there", "59:07", "needs to be", "59:08", "a differentiation between the", "59:09", "intentional non-intentional and we do", "59:11", "have that", "59:12", "in our policy there are definitely", "59:14", "mitigating factors available in our", "59:16", "policy that if you didn't do thing on", "59:17", "purpose", "59:18", "you're not you know you're not", "59:19", "sanctioned as high tim means is a great", "59:21", "example there so tim means", "59:23", "used a relatively benign supplement it", "59:25", "was a creatine", "59:26", "creatine you know generally doesn't have", "59:29", "an issue", "59:30", "as as opposed like testosterone booster", "59:32", "supplements we tell our athletes", "59:34", "stay away from anything marketing as a", "59:37",

quickly", "59:57", "so i think the same thing with joel", "59:58", "romero", "60:00", "so correct joelle romero used a natural", "60:02", "diuretic product that had", "60:04", "a sarm in it in all these cases", "60:08", "not only does the the prohibited", "60:10", "substance", "60:11", "need to show up and what the athlete has", "60:13", "says they've used already", "60:15", "but to protect

the", "60:33", "prohibited substance is in that", "60:35", "based on the interview with the athlete", "60:36", "of how much should you use when's the", "60:38", "last time you used it relative to this", "60:40", "test", "60:41", "do the science calculations just to make", "60:43", "sure an athlete's not saying well i know", "60:45", "this creatine has spiked with austrian", "60:48", "so i'm going to go use osterine and then", "60:50", "i have a built-in excuse", "60:51", "when i test positive for austrian in", "60:53", "order to be able to match", "60:54", "contaminant levels with what's

office so they are", "68:44", "the ones that", "68:45", "prosecute and you know cases involving", "68:48", "ped use that violates nevada regs so we", "68:52", "share all this with them and look just",

happening", "69:01", "next week in fact", "69:04", "they i think were understanding these", "69:06", "issues but", "69:07", "said look you know optically this", "69:10", "doesn't", "69:10", "look great and we feel that out of an", "69:13", "abundance of caution that we need to", "69:15", "have", "69:16", "a public hearing and be very transparent", "69:18", "about this because this", "69:20", "is this is some weird shit um", "69:24", "this was last friday so we're eight days", "69:25", "out from the fight so", "69:27", "you know we start talking about hey when", "69:29", "can we potentially have this", "69:30", "and unfortunately christmas holiday", "69:34", "several of the commissioners weren't", "69:35", "even in town", "69:37", "and basically what they said is look we", "69:39", "will absolutely do this", "69:41", "if you want us to but likely that", "69:43", "hearing would not be until today", "69:45", "thursday or maybe tomorrow friday and", "69:48", "you know marnell's like look i i'm", "69:50", "starting to get my head around this", "69:53", "but i can't guarantee you that my other", "69:55", "commissioners or me", "69:56", "are going to come out the same way so", "69:58", "you're taking you know you're taking a", "70:00", "chance here that", "70:01", "that we could say well we need more", "70:02", "information", "70:04", "so so basically they were willing to", "70:06", "listen to it", "70:07", "um i think they were starting to wrap", "70:10", "their heads around it but didn't feel", "70:11", "that they were up to speed enough", "70:13", "on it they didn't have the luxury", "70:16", "that andy foster and california have", "70:19", "remember when john tested positive", "70:21", "in july 2018 that fight was in", "70:24", "california", "70:25", "because that fight was in california", "70:27", "california retained jurisdiction", "70:30", "they've had two very public hearings on", "70:32", "john when they suspended his license", "70:34", "and most recently a week and a half ago", "70:36", "when they reinstated his license", "70:38", "so andy and the commission were very", "70:41", "familiar", "70:41", "with the world tyrion ball they were", "70:43", "very familiar", "70:45", "with the long-term metabolite and in", "70:47", "fact andy was somewhat critical", "70:49", "of usada during the last hearing he", "70:52", "thought", "70:52", "after looking at all the details after", "70:54", "reading you know mclaren's", "70:57", "position that there was no evidence that", "70:59", "this was done on purpose", "71:01", "he thought man maybe they went a little", "71:02", "bit hard on him and he stated that in", "71:04", "that in that second hearing", "71:06", "so with the reemergence of the the", "71:09", "picogram quantity of this m3 long-term", "71:11", "metabolite", "71:13", "annie and the commission unlike nevada", "71:16", "didn't need to get up and speed on it", "71:17", "they've already had two public hearings", "71:19", "on john's issue they were intimately", "71:21", "familiar", "71:22", "with you know some of these dynamics of", "71:24", "this drug", "71:26", "and the metabolites and that's why he", "71:28", "felt comfortable", "71:29", "based on their familiarization with it", "71:31", "and based on", "71:32", "these written absolute statements by", "71:35", "these experts so there was no", "71:36", "re-ingestion", "71:38", "one and then the second thing which we", "71:39", "haven't covered is these experts said", "71:42", "based on these low-level picograms", "71:44", "there's no performance-enhancing benefit", "71:46", "and that's an important point because if", "71:49", "you would have told ufc", "71:51", "look this is still remnants from a year", "71:53", "and a half ago", "71:55", "but we can't rule out that he's not", "71:57", "getting a performance enhancing benefit", "71:59", "from it", "72:00", "well in that instance i'll tell you and", "72:02", "you know i i stand by this i would i", "72:04", "would leave this company if somebody", "72:06", "told me otherwise", "72:07", "if there was any indication that there", "72:09", "would be a benefit from him", "72:10", "even though it technically wasn't a", "72:11", "violation i'm not going to stand by", "72:14", "while anybody licenses that guy to fight", "72:17", "could it been", "72:18", "could this have been somehow or another", "72:22", "mitigated by communicating these results", "72:25", "to nevada earlier", "72:27", "well we didn't announce the fight that", "72:29", "john was gonna fight in", "72:30", "in nevada until october but in october", "72:34", "so you have said hey look here's this", "72:37", "issue sure", "72:38", "potentially but the issue was usada", "72:41", "hadn't come", "72:42", "to that they were in the middle of that", "72:43", "point of consulting with", "72:46", "other professional sports leagues with", "72:48", "the other wada labs they hadn't reached", "72:50", "their conclusion their science expert", "72:52", "hadn't determined hey", "72:54", "this is definitely residual no", "72:55", "performance dancing they were still", "72:57", "going through that data at that point", "72:59", "so what they've told me is look we tried", "73:01", "to hurry that along as fast as possible", "73:03", "we wanted to make sure that that you", "73:05", "know we went through this and very", "73:07", "very detailed and no stone left on the", "73:08", "side when when did they reach this", "73:10", "conclusion", "73:12", "so this was early december so december 6", "73:14", "that letter went out saying we've had", "73:15", "these two", "73:16", "low-level positives back in august well", "73:18", "okay but here we are", "73:19", "i mean this is the end of december what", "73:22", "could", "73:23", "this have been headed off at the past", "73:25", "well again when nevada first got", "73:27", "notified", "73:28", "they thought like we were hoping well", "73:30", "he's had four negative tests", "73:32", "so he's probably going to be negative", "73:33", "going forward here right i mean that's", "73:35", "what", "73:36", "you know the lay person would think okay", "73:37", "he's probably out of the woods now", "73:39", "but you know again getting back to what", "73:42", "period of time is this in john's", "73:44", "preparation and if you look", "73:46", "at some of these numbers and when these", "73:48", "metabolites appear and disappear", "73:50", "in early august john was preparing his", "73:53", "defense for this arbitration i think he", "73:56", "had an idea based on talking to his", "73:57", "attorneys like hey", "73:59", "we got a pretty good shot here of some", "74:01", "mitigating factors where this", "74:02", "is potentially going to get reduced so i", "74:04", "think you know he starts to get a little", "74:06", "bit motivated gets in the gym", "74:08", "starts training again clearly in early", "74:11", "december that's the period of time when", "74:13", "our fighters that close to a fight are", "74:15", "bringing down that body weight", "74:17", "right they're cutting body fat they're", "74:18", "losing you know a little bit of water", "74:21", "so it certainly seems to correlate these", "74:23", "these", "74:24", "these pulsing you know effects with when", "74:26", "this is just", "74:29", "absolutely it is so uh this positive", "74:32", "result", "74:33", "was announced when so", "74:36", "a week ago yesterday", "74:39", "uh this is usada's announcement usada", "74:41", "notifies us", "74:42", "the ufc it always happens and they", "74:44", "notify if any commission has", "74:46", "jurisdiction at this point this close to", "74:48", "a fight nevada has jurisdiction", "74:51", "so i get the call and", "74:55", "you can imagine what's going through my", "74:56", "head i mean i i've gotten so many of", "74:58", "these calls now i literally for the", "75:00", "first five or ten minutes", "75:02", "can bury my head in my hand and think", "75:04", "through exactly how this thing's gonna", "75:06", "play out", "75:07", "and you know it's gonna be hey nevada's", "75:10", "gonna say", "75:11", "wait a second what's going on here we", "75:13", "need to root this out", "75:15", "john's going to say jesus christ like", "75:17", "what is going on in my life i can't get", "75:19", "a fucking break i'm trying to be careful", "75:23", "i even went through with dc how dc is", "75:25", "going to react and he react he's going", "75:26", "to be", "75:27", "i fucking told you this was the case", "75:29", "this guy's a cheater", "75:30", "you know usada's bullshit novitskiy's", "75:32", "bullshit all this stuff", "75:34", "goes through my head in the first five", "75:35", "or 10 minutes what's how's dana going to", "75:37", "react how's hunter going to react when i", "75:39", "have to go over to his office and", "75:40", "explain this out to them it played out", "75:43", "exactly as i saw it it's", "75:44", "it's it's some of the worst days of my", "75:46", "career when i get these calls", "75:48", "um but you know everyone was notified", "75:51", "and", "75:52", "nevada was in our office two days later", "75:54", "and again i mean", "75:56", "there's been some criticism of them out", "75:58", "there", "75:59", "i don't fault them this is a complicated", "76:01", "issue that optically", "76:03", "doesn't look great and to do anything in", "76:05", "a rush manner would be difficult", "76:07", "they did everything they could to afford", "76:09", "us having a hearing", "76:11", "um problem was it was just it was too", "76:13", "close to to a fight", "76:15", "so essentially to get this out this", "76:18", "issue with optics right because it", "76:20", "you go on twitter everybody's calling", "76:22", "them a cheat everybody's saying that you", "76:23", "know anybody that sanctions this is", "76:25", "you're sanctioning cheating for", "76:29", "someone to get an understanding of what", "76:31", "this is like it actually requires", "76:33", "probably more than we've done", "76:34", "now over the last hour and 15 minutes", "76:36", "yeah and i appreciate this for him i", "76:38", "mean dana and i went on sportscenter and", "76:40", "announced it in three minute hit and i", "76:41", "came out of there going", "76:42", "absolutely everyone in the world is", "76:44", "gonna say this is bullshit you can't", "76:46", "this is we're gonna have a hard time", "76:48", "doing this in two hours here", "76:50", "yeah those things yeah you've got you've", "76:52", "got to delve into it and you've also", "76:54", "have to put your trust and reliance on", "76:56", "these experts they have", "76:58", "a education professional career of 20 to", "77:01", "25 years", "77:02", "to come up with these absolutes there's", "77:04", "no one else", "77:05", "in the world but maybe a dozen people", "77:07", "that can come up with these conclusions", "77:10", "you do have to put your you know your", "77:11", "faith in in their background and their", "77:13", "careers and their knowledge and", "77:15", "education and", "77:16", "you know i read what you those absolutes", "77:18", "were that there was no", "77:19", "evidence of any re-ingestion this is by", "77:22", "multiple", "77:23", "experts and that john would not have", "77:26", "retained any performance benefit based", "77:28", "on these low-level picogram amounts", "77:30", "well i'm happy that we're going to have", "77:32", "this out there so people if they have", "77:34", "the time if they're really that", "77:35", "interested in it", "77:36", "this is probably a more in-depth", "77:38", "discussion of this than you're going to", "77:40", "get anywhere else", "77:41", "but i really wish we could have gotten", "77:43", "something like this to nevada and nevada", "77:45", "could have gone over this and", "77:46", "looked at what what i'm seeing what", "77:48", "you're saying", "77:49", "it seems to me that we could have just", "77:52", "had some sort of a meeting and kept this", "77:54", "fight in nevada and it would have saved", "77:55", "everybody a lot of heartache yeah i mean", "77:58", "i i think", "77:59", "things were pointing in that but there", "78:00", "was no guarantees on that roll the dice", "78:02", "baby it's nevada", "78:03", "come on it's vegas you know the other", "78:05", "thing that was being looked at was", "78:07", "was fairness to these athletes really", "78:09", "you're going to play", "78:10", "athletes you're going to put john and", "78:12", "gus maybe more importantly in a position", "78:14", "where he doesn't know", "78:15", "until two days or a day before whether", "78:17", "this fight is happening or not", "78:19", "i mean these and and not even mentioning", "78:22", "the other fighters on the card and look", "78:24", "you can talk to and i have to shawn and", "78:26", "mick and dana and hunter", "78:28", "all these fighters want to be on the big", "78:30", "pay-per-views", "78:31", "they know the bigger the fight at the", "78:33", "top of the card the more eyes are on", "78:35", "that fight and when you have a", "78:37", "spectacular fight in the first", "78:39", "second fight on the card if it's on a", "78:42", "big pay-per-view with a giant fight at", "78:43", "the top of it that can propel your", "78:45", "career your next fight you could be", "78:46", "fighting the main event on", "78:48", "you know a fight pass and progress from", "78:49", "there so", "78:51", "i think you know i think it's accurate", "78:53", "to say that generally", "78:54", "everybody wants these these cards to be", "78:56", "as big as possible and when", "78:58", "all the experts are telling us a 100", "79:01", "percent this isn't a sanction", "79:03", "b he's not retaining any performance", "79:05", "enhancing benefits i think", "79:07", "and clearly dane and hunter thought this", "79:09", "we have an obligation to do", "79:10", "what we can do for fairness for john", "79:14", "definitely for for gus for the rest of", "79:16", "the card to try to make this fight", "79:17", "happen", "79:18", "going forward is there any way we could", "79:20", "ever prevent something like this from", "79:21", "happening again with a similar situation", "79:24", "in a place like nevada so here's i think", "79:26", "we have a couple solutions to that and", "79:28", "it's not necessarily relative to the", "79:29", "commission but", "79:30", "one thing that obviously protected john", "79:33", "a lot in this was the frequency of", "79:35", "testing", "79:36", "you know if you look at his numbers and", "79:37", "and these were", "79:39", "these were instances where they", "79:40", "collected samples but in many of these", "79:42", "cases they did multiple tests on him and", "79:44", "that means", "79:45", "you know the tests i'm reading were for", "79:46", "the anabolic steroid panel", "79:48", "but in addition to that they may have", "79:50", "done biological passport tests on that", "79:52", "same collection they may have done an", "79:54", "hgh test an epo test", "79:56", "and this is all confidential that usada", "79:57", "doesn't release all this information", "79:58", "they release numbers on the publicly", "80:00", "available website", "80:01", "but you don't see what those tests are", "80:03",

said", "80:21", "you know hey we think that you probably", "80:24", "should you know", "80:25", "up the amount of tests that you're doing", "80:27", "so we just renewed", "80:30", "a contract with usada and we're reducing", "80:32", "we're increasing our testing numbers by", "80:34", "30 to 40 percent", "80:35", "we currently uh the first three years of", "80:38", "the program are under

this is an approved", "82:36", "line of supplements we approve you to", "82:39", "take this and this is something that", "82:40", "we've been unable to do in the first", "82:42", "three and a half

suggestion", "83:02", "but why doesn't the ufc come up with its", "83:04", "own supplement line", "83:05", "and provide them to the fighters and say", "83:08", "you can't take anything else", "83:09", "yeah i mean it's definitely been talking", "83:11", "through it's they had sponsorships with", "83:13", "other supplement lines", "83:14", "exactly there's a lot of dynamics to it", "83:16", "it's not as easy as", "83:17", "yeah doing it overnight and it's a", "83:19", "distribution method", "83:20", "just if you could say hey you could take", "83:22", "creatine you could take you know",

let's say nsf nsf has 1200", "84:06", "supplements that approve i'd say", "84:07", "all 1200 of these are approved you", "84:09", "should only use these if something were", "84:11", "to happen to an

is what you're the way", "91:38", "you're laying it out here i don't see", "91:40", "any holes in this", "91:41", "so you know a couple things in the", "91:43", "future that people can look forward to", "91:44", "look", "91:45", "we want and john wants to fight nevada", "91:47", "again and nevada's basically said look i", "91:50", "think we understand this issue but we", "91:51", "need to have this hearing", "91:52", "there will be a public hearing on this", "91:54", "my understanding is early quarter one so", "91:57", "look you know don't take my word for it", "91:59", "wait until
