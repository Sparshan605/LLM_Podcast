just pointing me in this direction", "01:10", "yeah in 2017 stuff that has never", "01:13", "happened to me before - kind of yeah", "01:17", "head towards the exit a little bit but", "01:20", "I'm good with it I'm a very decisive", "01:21", "person so this is probably one of them", "01:24", "that I thought about a little bit as far", "01:26", "as like how to be done or or if to be", "01:28", "done I guess but the how was the hardest", "01:31", "part my agent kept calling and saying", "01:33", "what about this and what if you did that", "01:35", "and I'm like no no no you all need to", "01:39", "get ready for me to be done please Wow", "01:41", "and so then he came up with the he's", "01:43", "like what if you finish up at the at", "01:45", "Daytona for the 500 and I was like what", "01:48", "about the Indy 500 and he goes and I was", "01:50", "really only referring to the Indy 500", "01:52", "and he was like well I'd I'd love you to", "01:53", "do both I was like oh well that's a good", "01:57", "idea so there's this thing in racing", "01:59", "called the double which is doing the", "02:01", "Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend on", "02:04", "Sunday and then flying straight to", "02:06", "Charlotte to do the coke 600 afterwards", "02:08", "and that's kind of known as the double", "02:10", "but this is what we're calling the day", "02:12", "double and it has to do with just having", "02:14", "spent you know a chunk of my career in", "02:16", "IndyCar and a chunk of my career in", "02:17", "NASCAR and it just kind of feels like", "02:19", "the right way to go out I don't know it", "02:20", "didn't it wasn't clear it was a bit of a", "02:22", "murky end as far as like what's gonna", "02:24", "happen am I gonna race next year", "02:26", "full-time or not and it just kind of", "02:28", "went suit too long for me to have like a", "02:30", "proper I'm done sort of moment in my", "02:33", "head so this was just a great way to do", "02:35", "it so when you say that things happen in", "02:37", "2017 that didn't happen before like what", "02:40", "do you mean I got a sponsor leave me my", "02:42", "primary sponsor left at the beginning of", "02:44", "the year I mean I I signed a contract", "02:46", "when Mercury's in retrograde so you know", "02:49", "I screwed myself there but I don't know", "02:52", "I don't know it was true so I guess", "02:56", "maybe the universe is a little bit more", "02:59", "straightforward than we think I think a", "03:01", "lot of good things probably happen", "03:02", "during that time in 2017 or during", "03:05", "Mercury retrograde I think people look", "03:11", "for some sort of like hidden meaning to", "03:13", "things when it comes to like astrology", "03:15", "yeah yeah I do try and understand it", "03:18", "it's quite I'm trying to understand how", "03:20", "it really matters but I don't know", "03:24", "there's definitely some things at least", "03:26", "with the moon that goes on I mean the", "03:29", "water changes with the moon so doesn't", "03:31", "that mean that other things should too", "03:33", "whether it be energetically or something", "03:35", "like that", "03:35", "I think the the water and the moon thing", "03:37", "kind of makes sense a little bit a", "03:39", "little bit mm-hmm", "03:41", "but I think it's probably just like", "03:42", "barely one way or the other maybe it's a", "03:45", "whisper on the wind kind of yeah I think", "03:47", "it's more in your head so stop putting", "03:48", "my crystals outside to charge under the", "03:50", "full moon maybe not so important I would", "03:52", "say it's not that important there's", "03:53", "something something someone sent me", "03:54", "about the army using crystals and I was", "03:57", "like this has got to be like an onion", "03:58", "article that the art of the army was", "04:00", "using crystals for like medics II think", "04:03", "if you could see find that way to find", "04:05", "it wounded people yeah look at this", "04:10", "stupid shit I don't know I don't know", "04:12", "I'm sure if it's real US Army's new", "04:14", "holistic medics treating gunshot wounds", "04:18", "with crystals and essential oils is", "04:20", "satire thank you thank you", "04:22", "essential oils don't you think there's a", "04:24", "plant that cures everything out there", "04:26", "there probably is something like that in", "04:27", "the Amazon that maybe not cures", "04:29", "everything but there's probably a lot of", "04:32", "stuff that we can throw essential oils", "04:33", "come from right yeah so pair that up", "04:36", "with some high vibrational stones high", "04:39", "vibrational stones tents so your sponsor", "04:47", "leaving you you were like that's it it's", "04:48", "just a never happened to me before I've", "04:50", "always been someone that's been really", "04:51", "well funded and I always had a sponsor", "04:54", "always had a sponsor and never a problem", "04:57", "and so yeah it was just things like that", "04:59", "were happening I got in a few big wrecks", "05:01", "in a row like probably three and six", "05:04", "weeks that were mmm you know like I was", "05:06", "bawling in the medical center after the", "05:08", "third one going I mean I was running", "05:10", "like top ten and a car blew a rotor and", "05:13", "clipped me and put me in the wall I was", "05:15", "on fire another driver broke his back I", "05:18", "mean it was a huge accident and I'm like", "05:21", "what is what is the message why does", "05:23", "someone trying to tell me right now and", "05:24", "so you know after I collected my shit", "05:27", "and got my face looking like halfway", "05:29", "decent to go talk to the media out there", "05:30", "I finally got out but yeah just stuff", "05:33", "like that was happening and I was I was", "05:35", "in a very go with the flow mood in 2017", "05:38", "I wasn't pushing for anything because I", "05:40", "wasn't really sure what I wanted so I", "05:41", "just let the universe take care of it", "05:43", "you've got a very interesting way of", "05:44", "looking at things you when things go", "05:47", "wrong you're like what is the universe", "05:49", "trying to tell me you're not like well I", "05:51", "Drive really fucking fast for a living", "05:53", "and sometimes shit goes wrong that", "05:55", "happens too I mean it seems like car", "05:58", "racing is just inherently crazy I mean", "06:01", "it's what I was saying what I was saying", "06:02", "you do one of the craziest things you", "06:03", "can for a living going 240 miles an hour", "06:05", "is no joke yeah metal and rubber and", "06:09", "things just yeah trust in something when", "06:13", "you're out there because you're doing", "06:14", "like you said 200 plus miles an hour", "06:16", "with you know people that aren't your", "06:19", "friends around you with walls don't you", "06:21", "as well so you know you kind of gotta", "06:23", "put your trust in something else yeah", "06:25", "that's why I was getting at that because", "06:27", "I think the way you think is a lot it's", "06:30", "very similar to the way fighter pilots", "06:32", "think fighter pilots have a lot of weird", "06:34", "superstitions and a lot of a lot of", "06:36", "pilots do a lot of people that are", "06:38", "involved in", "06:39", "things it's almost like in order to get", "06:42", "through the the task at hand", "06:45", "you almost have to delegate certain", "06:48", "aspects of reality to fate or to chance", "06:51", "or to write yeah I believe that yeah I", "06:54", "mean they have a tattoo on my back one", "06:58", "of us in America it's an American flag I", "06:59", "got that when I was 19", "07:00", "it's like an American flag that fades to", "07:02", "a checkered flag and then there's and", "07:04", "then I got that when I was 19 then when", "07:06", "I was about 27 I went and got the rest", "07:08", "which was angel wings and some stars and", "07:11", "you know it's not the most beautiful", "07:14", "piece art but it means something to me", "07:16", "won't be really beautiful in 30 years", "07:18", "I'm sure 40 but it's but yeah my point", "07:23", "is is that I would definitely pray that", "07:25", "you know I was taken care of and you got", "07:27", "a hand that off and just go do your damn", "07:29", "job and not be afraid and just trust in", "07:32", "the fate of everything and yeah so", "07:34", "that's kind of where the angel wings", "07:35", "came well I think that people that do", "07:37", "inherently risky things oftentimes look", "07:40", "for signs or look for some sort of you", "07:43", "know some direction some some message", "07:46", "from the universe and that's why I was", "07:48", "well I mean I feel like as a racecar", "07:51", "driver I've thought about this a lot", "07:52", "lately and I wonder how much of our job", "07:54", "is a little less even just feeling", "07:57", "what's happening and how much is", "07:59", "actually maybe more intuitive like maybe", "08:01", "we're maybe we're having more intuitive", "08:04", "understanding of what's going on and", "08:06", "what's coming then we realize we just", "08:09", "are so everything's happening so fast", "08:12", "and that you you just think oh I have", "08:16", "really good feel you know I mean I'm", "08:18", "sure there's some of that too but so I", "08:20", "think that maybe maybe you're maybe", "08:23", "maybe athletes or people at an elite", "08:25", "level or more in touch with that", "08:26", "intuitive side that finite like last", "08:31", "thread of feel maybe it's beyond feel", "08:34", "yeah knowing that makes sense I mean if", "08:38", "you think about the amount of time that", "08:39", "you've spent involved in that intense", "08:41", "activity in this you know they say that", "08:44", "people get road rage for one of the", "08:46", "reasons why people get road rage is", "08:48", "because when you're driving you are", "08:50", "reacting to things that", "08:52", "happen instantaneously very quickly so", "08:54", "your body is at a very heightened state", "08:56", "and people you know someone cuts you off", "08:58", "you they'd start freaking out like", "08:59", "instantly they go from 1 to 10 right", "09:02", "away and the reason is because they're", "09:04", "always at 7 and they don't even realize", "09:06", "they're at 7 when you're in the car", "09:07", "you're probably at like 13 this one goes", "09:11", "to 11 yeah you mean you're cranked up", "09:13", "right and so you're probably seeing", "09:15", "things and feeling things that the", "09:18", "average person yeah they don't", "09:19", "experience in their life 1 percent yeah", "09:21", "you're just working at that top little", "09:24", "top level of feeling of of focus that", "09:34", "were you calling in the zone", "09:36", "yeah where it kind of almost becomes", "09:38", "slightly out-of-body you know how it's", "09:41", "happening it's just happening well I", "09:43", "would imagine like you kind of melt away", "09:45", "and you're just completely involved when", "09:47", "I think when I think about what I have", "09:48", "to do like let's say as an example", "09:50", "coming in for a pit stop and you got", "09:52", "your throttle brake clutch gears all the", "09:55", "different things that you have to do to", "09:58", "think about it logically what you have", "09:59", "to do is so much more confusing than", "10:01", "just going on instinct of like just do", "10:03", "it", "10:04", "because you have to you know used you", "10:07", "only have two feet but you have three", "10:08", "pedals and you have to use all three", "10:09", "pedals at some point in time but you", "10:11", "want to be ready for everything and", "10:13", "you're coming in like with the clutch in", "10:15", "on the brake but then you have to get", "10:17", "back to the get to the get to the", "10:18", "throttle just in time but you have to", "10:20", "have the clutch in and you have to hold", "10:21", "the brake so you make sure you don't", "10:22", "roll there's all kinds of things you", "10:23", "have to do using all three pedals which", "10:25", "you have to feet and so when you kind of", "10:27", "when you have to think about what you", "10:28", "have to do it's a little more", "10:29", "overwhelming than just doing it do you", "10:31", "drive a manual in real life I would I", "10:33", "love it easy yeah I do too yeah yeah but", "10:36", "I mean a lot of people it seems like", "10:37", "it's kind of a dying thing yeah it is I", "10:40", "mean even Indy cars went to paddle", "10:41", "shifting before I was done it was", "10:43", "h-pattern and then it was sequential", "10:45", "gearbox and then it was paddle shifting", "10:47", "and then but NASCAR NASCAR still still", "10:49", "got the ol H pattern that left leg is", "10:51", "important for the whole feel of the", "10:53", "thing right well especially in an Indy", "10:55", "car in an Indy car you actually have a", "10:57", "full-on dead pedal so you have all three", "10:59", "pedals and then you have a dead pedal", "11:00", "which is is important because you spend", "11:03", "a lot of time with your foot there but", "11:05", "it is part of the feel it is absolutely", "11:07", "part of the feel of the car especially", "11:09", "with all the g-loads", "11:10", "how did you get involved in racing I", "11:13", "race go-karts when I was a kid my sister", "11:16", "and my sister wanted to race go-karts", "11:17", "and I just didn't want to get left out", "11:19", "so turns out I was alright it and I kept", "11:22", "going but it's it's a very unusual path", "11:24", "yeah well I mean I did everything though", "11:26", "I was I played like coach pitch then tee", "11:29", "ball I was in the band the choir", "11:32", "I took voice lessons I was a played", "11:35", "basketball volleyball cheerleading I", "11:38", "played in every sport I took tumbling", "11:41", "classes and then I also tried racing so", "11:44", "you've always been intense yeah yeah for", "11:47", "sure did you know at a certain age that", "11:49", "you wanted to be a racecar driver well", "11:51", "when I was 10 I decided that I wanted to", "11:52", "go to college for engineering so I could", "11:55", "learn how to work on my race car and I", "11:57", "realized wow I learned to be an engineer", "12:04", "so that you could work on your race car", "12:05", "do you understand how crazy that is", "12:07", "thirty ten years to be thinking that", "12:10", "well I don't know do you think you're", "12:15", "born that way or mine olds like what do", "12:17", "you think about that like to be thinking", "12:19", "that way when I'm 10 years old like you", "12:21", "you know some people are just so much", "12:22", "different or more mature further along", "12:25", "is it why do you think that is it's a", "12:28", "very good question I don't I I think", "12:31", "it's entirely possible that memory gets", "12:33", "transferred through DNA and that there", "12:36", "are certain people that have a long line", "12:38", "of adventurous people in their family", "12:41", "and that gets transferred to the DNA of", "12:43", "the children I think it's entirely", "12:44", "possible I have is not a spiritual", "12:48", "reincarnation no maybe I mean look it's", "12:51", "that's an that's entirely possible to I", "12:53", "would never I would never say no to that", "12:55", "because if you're living this life I", "12:57", "mean nobody asked to live this life you", "12:59", "just hear right mm-hmm", "13:01", "who knows if you get to do it again I", "13:03", "mean we're assuming that you don't get", "13:04", "to do it again because we're assuming", "13:06", "that time goes on sort of linear way but", "13:08", "maybe it just does for you in this life", "13:10", "it's entirely possible that there's", "13:12", "infinite number of lives being lived out", "13:14", "in infinite timelines all simultaneously", "13:18", "we just", "13:18", "this one we don't even know what happens", "13:20", "when we sleep you go to sleep you close", "13:22", "your eyes if some crazy dream about", "13:24", "Godzilla chasing you when you're on a", "13:26", "skateboard you wake up in the morning", "13:27", "and you just assume that you're on the", "13:29", "same timeline that you were on before", "13:31", "mm-hmm you know because you have known", "13:33", "the astral who knows I don't you know I", "13:36", "have children and in one of the things", "13:38", "that's really fascinating about watching", "13:40", "a child develop from a baby to you know", "13:42", "a kid and see their personality it's", "13:44", "like you realize like there's a lot of", "13:47", "stuff that's just that's what they come", "13:49", "with yeah that's what I'm saying so it's", "13:51", "just different why you know why why was", "13:54", "I thinking about being an engineer when", "13:56", "I was 10 years old why was I brave", "13:57", "enough to go live in England by myself", "13:59", "when I was 16 and all good with it and", "14:01", "you know why why why why my intent why", "14:06", "did why was I intense when you met me", "14:08", "yeah well I think part of your intensity", "14:11", "is probably if I had a guess if I could", "14:14", "be presumptuous you are a woman involved", "14:17", "in a very manly activity and I'm sure", "14:20", "men probably test you in some sort of a", "14:22", "weird way and so I bet along the way", "14:25", "you've developed this sort of like way", "14:28", "of addressing them right away like a", "14:30", "listen motherfucker sometimes just like", "14:34", "that yeah I mean I think you probably", "14:35", "have to you know I would imagine happen", "14:37", "to be strong you have to I remember when", "14:39", "I was younger and going to meetings with", "14:41", "companies or team bosses people like", "14:45", "that and was the advice given was don't", "14:49", "say oh I think this and maybe like you'd", "14:52", "be sure about what you want and I", "14:54", "remember that so yeah a nature versus", "14:57", "nurture some of its learned but some of", "14:58", "its just there yeah you can't turn a", "15:01", "timid person to you may be good but I", "15:05", "mean it's not not likely you would you", "15:08", "you seem to be like this person this is", "15:10", "just who you are yeah if you're telling", "15:12", "me that at 10 years old you were", "15:13", "thinking about being an engineer so you", "15:14", "could work on race cars that's not", "15:16", "normal", "15:16", "yeah I mean what's normal what you want", "15:19", "to do when you were 10 years old I had", "15:20", "no idea I probably wanted to be an", "15:22", "artist I think I wanted to be an artist", "15:25", "that follows this vein sort of yeah but", "15:28", "I used to want to draw comic books I did", "15:31", "a lot of that", "15:32", "yeah so that was probably what I wanted", "15:33", "but I was never like what I need to do", "15:35", "is like I need to figure out a way to", "15:37", "make my hand stronger so they draw", "15:39", "faster let's keep in mind I did not go", "15:43", "to college in fact I didn't even finish", "15:45", "high school you didn't at all nope I", "15:47", "left when I was 16 and I got my GED", "15:49", "Wow I failed the first time Wow I don't", "15:52", "know why yeah okay good because that's", "15:54", "like a horrible like I failed my GED oh", "15:57", "geez", "15:58", "I the Constitution test is something at", "16:02", "least in Illinois I don't know if you", "16:03", "have to pass it in every state but in", "16:05", "Illinois you do and so in eighth grade", "16:07", "to go to high school you have to get a", "16:09", "70% or above to go to high school I got", "16:12", "a 70 so I went to high school now I'm", "16:15", "like a 3.5 and above student like I was", "16:17", "a zandi's not a problem for some reason", "16:21", "the Constitution and government and all", "16:23", "of those sectors and names and holy", "16:26", "moley it's so confusing to me so so then", "16:30", "when it came time to do my take my GED I", "16:32", "didn't study at all I just took the test", "16:34", "and I failed the Constitution test yeah", "16:40", "I mean I've never studied in my life so", "16:43", "anything no really yeah the only thing I", "16:48", "study up and well study if I'm doing a", "16:52", "speech or if I'm doing it something for", "16:55", "a

difference I don't know", "25:36", "what's it like to be a guy", "25:39", "yeah probably different but I think that", "25:41", "like what's it like to be a woman that's", "25:45", "the only woman who's in NASCAR at your", "25:48", "level that's that's a valid question I", "25:51", "mean that's crazy how does everybody", "25:52", "else treat you yeah that that really is", "25:55", "the main question I can't answer because", "25:57", "I'm not them and I I know that from from", "26:01", "enough experience now because I used to", "26:04", "not really look into it much and in the", "26:05",

so", "26:20", "but in NASCAR you can hit each other and", "26:22", "it's you have bumpers and which is", "26:25", "really cool but it also isn't cool", "26:26", "because if somebody wants to do it they", "26:27", "can so what would I say I would say that", "26:31", "they don't want to get passed by a girl", "26:32", "and you know what I don't either", "26:34", "is that weird no", "26:36", "I really don't I mean I've driven I've", "26:38", "raced with girls and I don't I don't", "26:40", "like it so do you do you feel", "26:43", "differently when a guy passes you than", "26:44", "when a girl passes you probably yeah yes", "26:47", "and what why well you don't you just go", "26:50", "internally that bitch I'm like I can't", "26:54", "believe my car isn't faster right sucks", "26:58", "but if it's a guy that passes that are", "27:01", "not good that I'm like you know come on", "27:03", "the radio and I'll be like yeah I just", "27:05", "want you to see that what car passed me",

you know", "27:18", "aren't very good and that they they", "27:21", "somewhat don't belong and I get like a", "27:24", "little bit of animosity at first but I", "27:26", "would have thought that people would", "27:28", "have got got used to it a little bit", "27:29", "more than they did so but you have that", "27:32", "cultural and mas that you were saying a", "27:33", "little bit yeah yeah I don't know where", "27:35", "it comes from but when you say that it's", "27:37", "a it's a cultural norm that girls aren't", "27:39", "good you don't think about that about", "27:41", "yourself", "27:41", "no yeah see I knew that there's you", "27:44", "don't have any doubts I get everyone out", "27:46", "there I'm like you suck because of this", "27:48", "and I'm gonna beat you cuz of that and", "27:50", "right god I hate you I don't think", "27:52", "because I'm a girl I'm not as good as", "27:54", "though no not at all so why would you", "27:56", "think that about the other I don't know", "27:57", "I just cuz I'm not used to it right you", "27:59", "just something you're not used to yeah", "28:01", "that makes sense", "28:02", "yeah well also it's like you're unique I", "28:04",

"28:34", "surprised when people surpass those", "28:36", "expectations yeah you know but I would", "28:38", "think that you would experience probably", "28:42", "more discrimination as a woman than I", "28:46", "mean if you think about a woman", "28:49", "doing almost any other job like if", "28:51", "you're telling me you're the only woman", "28:53", "that does that and you're at this", "28:56", "intense macho job this is a fucking", "29:00", "intense job I mean you're going 200", "29:03", "miles an hour everybody's it's nuts", "29:06", "that's a crazy job and you're out there", "29:09", "at the top of the food chain with all", "29:11", "these men yeah I would I would imagine", "29:14", "there's two things that happen", "29:16", "there's a bunch of guys that treat you", "29:17", "with respect mm-hmm they're they're like", "29:19", "wow they look impressed", "29:21", "yeah yeah they're cool with you they'll", "29:22", "and she's one of us that's right and", "29:24", "then there's a few that are just dicks", "29:26", "mm-hmm and that those dicks are just", "29:28", "encouraging and the amount of times I", "29:33", "wish I was good at taking people out I", "29:35", "wish people knew how hard it was to", "29:36", "actually take someone out on track it's", "29:38", "not that easy because you can risk", "29:40", "yourself exactly yeah and if your car", "29:44", "doesn't handle very well you can't get", "29:45", "close enough to him if you could you", "29:48", "would just move the air which is almost", "29:50", "like hitting them and get them out of", "29:51", "the way but sometimes the car doesn't", "29:53", "handle well enough so like you'd have to", "29:55", "just bomb in there and God willing you", "29:57", "hit him to get you to slow down and then", "29:59", "days go sailing and you keep going but", "30:02", "it's risk that's a rare moment right", "30:04", "yeah have you done before I've tried to", "30:07", "take people I suck at it I absolutely", "30:09", "suck at it I've taken myself out like", "30:11", "three times trying to do it I mean look", "30:13", "I'll be the lamb I don't mind to make a", "30:15", "point yeah I got to make a point if", "30:18", "someone's driving like a dick yeah yeah", "30:22", "there was uh what was the one that was", "30:24", "the most sad was um it was a couple", "30:27", "years ago it was at Martinsville and", "30:29", "this is when something was going down", "30:30", "with it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano", "30:33", "and it was during the chase which is the", "30:36", "last ten races of the season and they", "30:38", "were in the chase Matt and Joey and Joey", "30:41", "had made it so that Matt couldn't get in", "30:43", "because he took him out a week earlier a", "30:44", "week or two earlier and then they got to", "30:46", "Martinsville and it's a very very small", "30:47", "short track it's just a half a mile and", "30:49", "so it's easy to kind of be able to", "30:52", "attack if you want to and so he just", "30:54", "straight took him out and there's a", "30:57", "whole big hoopla about it people up in", "31:00", "arms thought it was totally unfair and", "31:03", "anyway during the same race some asshole", "31:05", "hits me takes pins me out and so I come", "31:08", "back and I'm a lap down or something cuz", "31:11", "he spins me out and I go to take him out", "31:13", "and I just sail off into the corner he", "31:15", "manages to kind of keep going I spin", "31:17", "again because I'm horrible at it and", "31:19", "turns out that you know I get a fifty", "31:22", "thousand dollar fine because I am I'm", "31:27", "not racing for position because I was a", "31:29", "lap down and they applied that because", "31:32", "that was also the same race that Matt", "31:33", "and Joey had their big thing and I think", "31:35", "maybe Joey was leading or something like", "31:37", "I think he was leading and it was on a", "31:39", "restart so they weren't racing for", "31:41", "position either so that was kind of like", "31:43", "their rule that they put forth to make", "31:46", "for I mean Joe Matt probably got a", "31:48", "hundred or two hundred thousand dollar", "31:49", "fine but there I am you know not the I'm", "31:53", "definitely screwed in this scenario so I", "31:55", "got fined 50 grand for it and I'm the", "31:57", "one that's out so if you're another guy", "31:59", "if you're racing for position then it's", "32:00", "okay to bump into each other apparently", "32:02", "yeah so really you're the one that's", "32:05", "screwed because if you're racing if", "32:07", "someone takes you out and then you're", "32:09", "still racing for position now you're", "32:11", "gonna have to be potentially you know", "32:13", "putting yourself in another position to", "32:14", "get taken out when they started it", "32:16", "there's no win for the person that's", "32:18", "being aggressed was it always legal to", "32:23", "bump into each other it's gone kind of", "32:26", "through waves of different rules but", "32:28", "yeah I mean it is legal but whenever a", "32:31", "big accident happens and there's a", "32:32", "tragedy I would assume that that's when", "32:34", "they tighten down the rules sometimes", "32:37", "sometimes not sometimes they just accept", "32:39", "that it just happens sometimes it's just", "32:41", "usually if there's something like that", "32:43", "that happens it's not from one person's", "32:45", "action that it's maybe a chain of events", "32:48", "that leads to something like that it's", "32:50", "one of the rare jobs that you do that's", "32:52", "a sport one of the rare sports where the", "32:55", "potential for death is always there yeah", "32:58", "it's true", "32:58", "it

think that it's what we", "92:23", "think it is I think it's most likely far", "92:27", "beyond the the places that we can", "92:30", "currently travel to and I think that by", "92:32", "the time they get to a high level of", "92:36", "sophistication they're most likely not", "92:38", "even organic anymore and I think that", "92:40", "that's the future of the human race of", "92:42", "consciousness well I think maybe that", "92:44", "but I also think there's a real problem", "92:46", "with the possibility of artificial", "92:47", "intelligence I think human beings are", "92:50", "about to create life whether we", "92:52", "recognize it as", "92:53", "for not what artificial life is going to", "92:56", "be is life artificial intelligence is", "92:58", "going to have the ability to change", "92:59", "itself multiply what human beings have", "93:04", "been able to do in terms of", "93:06", "technological innovation by a rate of", "93:09", "something insane like in two years", "93:12", "they'll be able to do 10,000 years of", "93:14", "innovation in terms of like what we're", "93:17", "capable of doing so I think that what", "93:20", "we're looking at now is the the last", "93:23", "days of biological life I think a", "93:26", "hundred years from now five hundred", "93:27", "years from now whatever it is there", "93:29", "won't be biological humans anymore I", "93:32", "think they'll this will be an archaic", "93:34", "outdated will change as we know it yeah", "93:37", "I can I mean you know I don't believe in", "93:40", "everything the Bible says but you know", "93:42",

the stuff in", "93:51", "the Bible that's all local like if you", "93:53", "if you lived where Hurricane Katrina hit", "93:55", "you think the apocalypse was there right", "93:57", "if you were in you

exist sure true you were", "94:09", "isolated yeah I think that's what all of", "94:11", "our our notions of the Apocalypse are", "94:13", "they're periodic natural disasters that", "94:15", "are unbelievably devastating like", "94:17", "they've proven that the entire human", "94:20", "race was was down to a few thousand", "94:23", "people because of a supervolcano around", "94:26", "70,000 years ago so I think there's been", "94:29", "a series of those events throughout", "94:31", "history where the human race is brought", "94:33", "down to an almost unmanageable level and", "94:36", "then we repopulated and I think that", "94:38", "that's probably the origins of the", "94:41", "apocalypse or asteroid impacts which are", "94:43", "very common they've have been all", "94:45", "throughout history do you think that AI", "94:47", "is gonna just eliminate biological", "94:50", "humans I think it's entirely possible", "94:51", "that we're going to give into it too", "94:53", "that we're gonna take it we're gonna", "94:54", "first of all become symbiotic we're", "94:56", "gonna take something and put it inside", "94:58", "of us it's going to enhance us whether", "95:00",

have", "95:57", "to be careful we don't alter ourselves", "95:59", "too much because then we won't exist as", "96:01", "a human race because we won't be able to", "96:02", "procreate and that is what keeps our", "96:05", "race alive that's probably true I mean", "96:08", "if you think about where we're gonna go", "96:09", "but also it doesn't it have to keep", "96:12", "evolving I mean if we got back look do", "96:15", "you think like monkeys when they were", "96:17", "living in trees throwing shit at each", "96:19", "other different than that now we got to", "96:20", "be chill otherwise

afraid of", "96:47", "change I'm not okay so I have a moment", "96:51", "I'll take the arm I have a moment of you", "96:55", "know fear of like oh shit and then", "96:58", "there's the next moment as well maybe", "97:00", "it's better than I could ever expect", "97:01", "what if there imagine they'll give you", "97:03", "two options they give you one robot arm", "97:05", "that you never have to work out it'll", "97:07", "always be strong you need that one or", "97:09", "you can get one that you constantly have", "97:11", "to work out oh I would probably take the", "97:15", "robot arm which which robot arm would", "97:17", "you take the one that you constantly", "97:18", "have to work out now or would you take", "97:20", "the one that's just", "97:21", "perfect yeah I probably think
