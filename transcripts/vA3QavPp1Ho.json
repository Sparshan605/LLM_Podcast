["00:00", "four three two one", "00:04", "yeah and we're live all right so to set", "00:10", "this up when Gary was on last Gary", "00:13", "Taubes Stephan how do I say your last", "00:16", "name Stephan DNA DNA yeah DNA", "00:19", "it's like DNA like DNA but with a G", "00:21", "right got it okay when you were on last", "00:25", "Stephan had some opposition to some of", "00:29", "the things that you were saying we", "00:31", "talked about getting him on and you on", "00:34", "together we finally pulled it off took", "00:37", "there was a lot of wrangling there's a", "00:38", "lot of back-and-forth and cat wrangling", "00:40", "but we got it we're here give me your", "00:44", "position on this is all folks listening", "00:47", "this is all about obesity and the the", "00:51", "mechanism for obesity is that fair to", "00:53", "say", "00:53", "yeah yeah so essentially the main points", "00:57", "that we want to talk about today I'll", "00:59", "try to keep this up fist from your face", "01:00", "okay sure just that you move around", "01:02", "um what causes obesity and what causes", "01:05", "insulin resistance which is behind a lot", "01:07", "of our chronic diseases that are common", "01:10", "in society and please give us your", "01:13", "background yeah so I have a BS and", "01:19", "biochemistry PhD in neuroscience after", "01:22", "getting my PhD in neuroscience I went on", "01:24", "to study the neuroscience of obesity at", "01:26", "the University of Washington and", "01:27", "particularly the brain circuits that", "01:29", "regulate body fatness hopefully we'll", "01:31", "get a chance to talk about those today", "01:33", "and then I went on to become a science", "01:37", "consultant science communicator and", "01:39", "write a book

is your disagreement with", "01:55", "Gary's position yeah so how about how", "02:00", "about I just can I start to explain", "02:03", "please do what I believe causes obesity", "02:05", "I'm gonna be long-winded here is that", "02:07", "it's okay go right ahead all right we", "02:08", "have ours okay cool so first a little", "02:11", "bit of housekeeping I'm going to be", "02:13", "citing a lot", "02:13", "evidence today and so I was one of these", "02:15", "bring this up to your focus sure just", "02:17", "moving around sure you want to sit back", "02:18", "how's that day perfect okay I'm gonna be", "02:21", "exciting a lot of evidence today and I", "02:23", "want people to be able to follow along", "02:24", "at home and so I put many of the", "02:27", "references that I'm gonna be citing on", "02:29", "that so it doesn't cover your face okay", "02:31", "there we go all right I put a lot of the", "02:34", "references that I'm gonna be citing on", "02:35", "my website Stephon Guillen a.com or if", "02:38", "you don't feel like spelling my name you", "02:39", "can go to whole health sore so our G and", "02:42", "I have a numbered list of topics there", "02:45", "and I'm

want to be really clear about", "02:56", "today is that I'm not here to be the", "02:59", "anti low carb guy okay um I think low", "03:03", "carb diets are a valid tool for", "03:05", "controlling body fatness and controlling", "03:07", "blood sugar I'm not here to talk anybody", "03:10", "out of being on a low carb diet what I", "03:12", "am here to try to talk people out of is", "03:14",

brain is important in obesity so", "03:28", "imagine you're an alien coming down from", "03:30", "outer space and you want to understand", "03:32", "what's going on on earth and you notice", "03:34", "that on the highway some cars are", "03:36", "traveling faster than others some cars", "03:38", "go faster some cars go slower and you", "03:40", "want to figure out why and so you go and", "03:43",

some", "04:02", "cars go faster than others now why is", "04:04", "that the reason is that you're studying", "04:06", "the wrong part of the system if you want", "04:09", "to understand the why some cars go", "04:13", "faster than others you have to", "04:15", "understand the part of the system that", "04:16", "regulates speed and that is the person", "04:19", "behind the wheel and so in this analogy", "04:22", "the tires are fat cells and the person", "04:25", "behind the wheel is the brain there has", "04:27", "been", "04:28", "tons of research on fat cell biology on", "04:31", "what factors put fat in fat cells what", "04:34", "take it out been tons and tons of", "04:36", "research on that and it's intuitively", "04:37", "obvious that we should be studying that", "04:39", "to

"the wrong part of the system study fat", "04:52", "cells do not regulate the size of fat", "04:54", "cells any more than the tires on a car", "04:56", "regulate the speed of the car the thing", "05:00", "that regulates the size of fat cells is", "05:02", "the brain so let's talk about first I'll", "05:05", "give you a little framework for thinking", "05:07", "about this the brain evolved over about", "05:09", "600 million years to promote the", "05:11", "survival and reproduction of our", "05:13", "ancestors and over the course of that", "05:15", "time we evolved all these different",

circuits", "05:35", "evolved and these are non conscious by", "05:37", "the way so you don't decide you want to", "05:39", "be hungry you don't decide that you want", "05:41", "to have a craving these are things that", "05:42", "bubble up from non conscious parts of", "05:45", "your brain that you don't control so", "05:48", "these circuits are calibrated to an", "05:52", "environment of our

the survival and", "06:04", "reproduction of our ancestors so what", "06:08", "happens when you put these brain", "06:09", "circuits in the modern environment where", "06:11", "you have abundant calorie dense tasty", "06:14", "foods rich in carbohydrate and fat is", "06:17", "these same brain circuits push us to", "06:19", "over-consume and they push our bodies to", "06:21", "accumulate and hold on to fat and then", "06:24", "what you see as a result is the three", "06:26", "hallmarks of obesity first of all the", "06:29", "obvious you see elevated body fat mass", "06:31", "second of all you see elevated calorie", "06:34", "intake people with obesity consume more", "06:37", "calories and people who do not have", "06:39", "obesity after correcting for", "06:41", "and sex and physical activity level and", "06:44", "third you see that people with obesity", "06:46", "defend their higher level of body", "06:49", "fatness against changes and so there's", "06:52", "actually a regulatory change that", "06:54", "happens it's not conscious defense you", "06:57", "know they're not trying to remain obese", "07:00", "it's these body fat regulatory circuits", "07:04", "and this is where Gary gets it right is", "07:05", "that people with obesity are not just", "07:08", "lean people who eat more calories", "07:10", "there's actually a change in the", "07:12", "regulatory activity that regulates body", "07:14", "fat in the body and we can get back to", "07:17", "how that happens but I'll just leave it", "07:19", "there for now so up until this point", "07:21", "I've basically just been telling a", "07:24", "plausible story right I mean I haven't", "07:26", "actually sighted any evidence yet to", "07:28", "support that my story is correct and so", "07:32", "let's get into that let's talk about", "07:33", "what some of the evidence is that", "07:34", "supports this idea that I've just laid", "07:36", "out so I want to start with the genetics", "07:40", "of obesity I think this offers some", "07:42", "weight for one second", "07:44", "as long as it's very breech the question", "07:46", "I don't I still don't quite understand", "07:48", "what the model is okay if you don't", "07:54", "understand the model how about I lay out", "07:55", "how about I finished laying it out and", "07:57", "then you can ask a question because I", "07:59", "may answer your question over the course", "08:01", "of continuing so let me just finish okay", "08:05", "so now the genetics of obesity offers us", "08:10", "a lot of insight into the biological", "08:12", "mechanisms that drive differences in", "08:14", "body fatness in the general population", "08:16", "so you get these studies like the the", "08:19", "most interesting studies are the", "08:20", "genome-wide Association studies they get", "08:23", "hundreds of thousands of people together", "08:24", "and they sequence are they they measure", "08:30", "all these markers and their genomes and", "08:31", "they figure out what parts of the genome", "08:33", "makes some people fatter than others so", "08:35", "if you have version a in this particular", "08:38", "location you end up a little fatter than", "08:40", "if you have version B and when you look", "08:42", "at all the places where this is", "08:43", "happening you can see the genes where", "08:45", "it's happening in and that tells you if", "08:47", "you look at what those genes are doing", "08:49", "that tells you what the mechanisms are", "08:51", "that underlie everyday differences in", "08:54", "body fatness in", "08:55", "general population and so to kind of", "08:58", "warm ourselves up let's start top by", "08:59", "talking about height genes so height has", "09:02", "a strong genetic component so does body", "09:04", "fatness and researchers has figured out", "09:08", "a lot of the genes that underlie", "09:09", "differences in height between people and", "09:11", "when you look at what those genes do", "09:14", "they tend to be involved in the growth", "09:16", "and development of the skeleton and the", "09:18", "connective tissue which is what you", "09:20", "would expect right because growth of the", "09:21", "skeleton determines your height so genes", "09:24", "that determine diabetes risk type 2", "09:27", "diabetes are all about insulin", "09:29", "sensitivity all about insulin secretion", "09:31", "and the function of the", "09:34", "insulin-secreting pancreas which is what", "09:37", "you expect because diabetes is a disease", "09:40", "that is all about insulin so these", "09:42", "studies are really good at getting at", "09:44", "the underlying biological mechanisms", "09:46", "that are driving these phenomena so what", "09:49", "do these studies have to say about", "09:51", "obesity if Gary's model is correct we", "09:54", "should see a bunch of genes popping up", "09:56", "related to fat cells and insulin if my", "09:59", "model is correct we should see a bunch", "10:01", "of genes popping up related to the brain", "10:03", "and in fact that's exactly what we see", "10:06", "the genetics of obesity are", "10:08", "overwhelmingly related to differences in", "10:10", "brain activity between individuals and", "10:14", "okay so that's one piece of evidence", "10:17", "another piece of evidence there are five", "10:20", "fda-approved weight-loss drugs four of", "10:24", "those acting the brain one of them", "10:26", "reduces dietary fat absorption in the", "10:29", "digestive tract there are no effective", "10:31", "fat loss drugs that I'm aware of the", "10:34", "target insulin or fat cells third piece", "10:37", "of evidence if you look at some people", "10:39", "get really unlucky in life and they end", "10:42", "up with these horrible genetic mutations", "10:44", "that you know knock out some biological", "10:46", "pathways some of these people end up", "10:49", "with extreme obesity people and also", "10:52", "animals we see this in mice and rats", "10:54", "just occasionally you get unlucky and", "10:56", "you get really really fat and", "10:57", "researchers have been cataloguing what", "11:00", "are these mutations when we find people", "11:01", "who are genetically really obese", "11:03", "what are these mutations that are making", "11:05", "them fat what is the biological", "11:07", "mechanism that's getting", "11:09", "screwed up that's making them fat and", "11:11", "what they've found is that all of these", "11:13", "mutations that they've identified to", "11:15", "date a number of them are occurring in", "11:17", "the leptin signaling pathway and this is", "11:22", "the leptin is the primary fat regulating", "11:27", "hormone in the body", "11:29", "Gary avoids this never talks about this", "11:31", "in his writing but leptin is the primary", "11:33", "fat regulating hormone in the body and", "11:36", "these mutations either knock out leptin", "11:38", "they knock out leptin receptors or they", "11:41", "knock out the left and response pathway", "11:43", "in the brain and so that's the third", "11:46", "piece of evidence ok so now we haven't", "11:50", "really gotten around to talking about", "11:52", "what it is exactly about the bad", "11:55", "interaction that happens between our", "11:57", "ancient brains and the modern food", "11:59", "environment that causes us to become fat", "12:02", "we've established that the brain is", "12:04", "central to obesity but we haven't really", "12:06", "established what it is exactly about", "12:08", "that interaction why does our modern", "12:10", "food why does our modern environment", "12:12", "promote obesity right so basically there", "12:18", "are three different ways that I'm gonna", "12:21", "look at this from but first I want to", "12:25", "say that the probably the best way to", "12:29", "answer this question is to start with", "12:31", "the question what is the most fattening", "12:32", "diet in the world what is the diet that", "12:35", "is more fattening than any others and", "12:36", "the answer to that is it's human junk", "12:39", "food in a variety of non-human species", "12:42", "and humans it's human junk food that is", "12:45", "more fattening than any others and I'm", "12:47", "gonna skip over some of the research", "12:48", "here that demonstrates this by the way I", "12:52", "haven't been calling out numbers here", "12:53", "okay let me call out some numbers", "12:57", "reference number two on my website is", "13:01", "those genetic studies reference number", "13:05", "one is the obesity drugs reference", "13:09", "number six is those spontaneously", "13:11", "occurring genetic mutations and now I'm", "13:13", "talking about reference number 52 so I'm", "13:17", "gonna I'm gonna gloss over some of the", "13:18", "individual research because I'm being", "13:20", "long-winded here but essentially", "13:23", "you find is that this stuff is really", "13:25", "fattening in animals many different", "13:27", "species that's super fattening in humans", "13:29", "calorie dense when you put create an", "13:32", "environment with abundant easy calorie", "13:35", "dense tasty foods rich in carbs and fat", "13:39", "you see this dramatic over consumption", "13:41", "and fat gain across many species", "13:44", "including humans and what you find in", "13:46", "the research is that the sugar and the", "13:50", "carbohydrate cannot explain that they're", "13:53", "part of the effect yes to explain part", "13:56", "of it but you cannot replicate that", "13:58", "effect by only feeding sugar and", "14:01", "carbohydrate you can't replicate it in", "14:02", "animals you can't replicate it in humans", "14:05", "when you say you can't replicate it you", "14:06", "mean you can't replicate obesity what do", "14:08", "you mean yeah that's right you cannot", "14:10", "you cannot cause the same degree of fat", "14:15", "gain the same extent of fat gain the", "14:17", "same extent of overconsumption using", "14:19", "only sugar and carbohydrate that you can", "14:22", "cause with a variety of calorie dense", "14:25", "palatable human foods you can't fully", "14:28", "replicate it with sugar and carbs you", "14:31", "cannot fully replicate it with fat alone", "14:33", "either if you put those when we can we", "14:35", "can get deeper in this if you want but", "14:37", "I'm confused so you're saying that the", "14:40", "the diet that causes the most obesity is", "14:42", "what we think right this human junk food", "14:45", "diet rich in sugar simple carbs bullshit", "14:48", "bullshit diet right what do you you're", "14:52", "saying that you can't replicate that", "14:54", "with just you cannot are fully", "14:56", "replicated boolean so what I mean is", "14:58", "that if you just feed if you just", "15:02", "increase sugar intake right in animals", "15:04", "or in humans you do get weight gain but", "15:08", "it is modest compared to what you get", "15:10", "when you put people around a variety of", "15:13", "calorie dense palatable foods rich in", "15:15", "carbohydrate in fat similarly if you", "15:19", "that's very confusing how's that because", "15:22", "I'm not sure exactly what you're saying", "15:24", "you're saying you if you give people", "15:26", "this calorie rich sugar diet of junk", "15:31", "food you will make them gain weight but", "15:35", "not as much way", "15:36", "as what so what I'm saying is that if", "15:41", "you if you give people or animals the", "15:45", "the actual human junk food with all the", "15:48", "carbs and fat and everything they gain a", "15:51", "lot more weight and a lot faster than if", "15:54", "you just give them a diet that's high in", "15:56", "sugar and high in refined carbohydrate", "15:58", "and what that shows is that the sugar", "16:00", "and they're fine carbohydrate cannot", "16:02", "fully explain the effect can't actually", "16:04", "explain why those foods are fattening", "16:07", "see this one no I don't do it okay", "16:09", "because you're saying if you give people", "16:11", "the diet of American junk food you you'd", "16:16", "get not as much of an effect if you give", "16:20", "them just the sugar in the carbohydrate", "16:22", "right we're saying yeah so but what are", "16:23", "you giving them when you're giving them", "16:24", "the diet of junk food you can well for", "16:27", "example in animals no it's different", "16:29", "because if you think about human junk", "16:31", "foods generally those foods contain fat", "16:34", "and carbohydrate and salt and all kinds", "16:36", "of other things so it's more it's more", "16:39", "than just it's a lot Soekarno yes so", "16:42", "just and okay sugar", "16:43", "so I'll get in more detail so the ways", "16:46", "that you can do this you can add sugar", "16:48", "just sugar table sugar to the feed of", "16:52", "animals that's one way to do it or you", "16:53", "can add it to their drinking water", "16:55", "sometimes it's a little bit fattening", "16:57", "sometimes it's not it's not that", "16:58", "fattening and animals in humans you can", "17:02", "ask them to drink sugar sweetened", "17:04", "beverages that are just sugar and you", "17:06", "can see what happens and people will", "17:08", "gain weight or you can tell them to stop", "17:09", "drinking sugar sweetened beverages and", "17:11", "you can see what happens okay", "17:12", "people will gain weight they will lose", "17:14", "weight suggesting that that is part of", "17:17", "the explanation but it's a much smaller", "17:19", "effect than you see with this full", "17:22", "pallet of these foods that contain carbs", "17:25", "and fat and all this other stuff as I'm", "17:27", "saying car well obviously there's more", "17:29", "calories right if there's carbs and fat", "17:31", "and all these other correct if you think", "17:33", "that calories matter then we agree oh", "17:35", "well the short matters right Gary", "17:38", "doesn't think it matters you don't think", "17:40", "it matters well I think it's the wrong", "17:41", "way to think about it what do you", "17:43", "disagree if anything with what he said", "17:45", "so far well so far what he said hasn't", "17:48", "been particularly", "17:49", "revelatory um the I think we have to", "17:56", "step back for a second because you know", "17:59", "while the low-carb community might have", "18:01", "a better understanding of where we", "18:03", "disagree I think the greater community", "18:07", "and that Jo reaches might not so", "18:11", "fundamentally with Stefan saying and", "18:13", "with the research community saying and", "18:15", "the conventional thinking in this field", "18:16", "is that the brain and correct me any", "18:19", "point they get this wrong but the brain", "18:21", "regulates does the fundamental job of", "18:24", "controlling how fat we are yes and the", "18:27", "way it does it is by controlling or Mis", "18:30", "controlling our intake and our", "18:33", "expenditure and the difference ends up", "18:36", "in fat tissue is that fair to say for", "18:38", "the most primarily intake but yeah yeah", "18:40", "so Stefan has a brain centric view of", "18:43", "the universe and the community at large", "18:46", "does as well so if we go outside and we", "18:49", "walk down you know Ventura Boulevard and", "18:52", "we see some of the weighs 400 pounds", "18:57", "they've clearly taken in more calories", "18:59", "and they should have over the course of", "19:01", "their life and it's been stored in their", "19:04", "fat tissue and Stefan says I think would", "19:07", "say that the problem is in their brains", "19:10", "ability to regulate intake to", "19:12", "expenditure is

I want to just the", "27:48", "thing I wanted to read how much I'll ask", "27:50", "you the question how much of the the", "27:52", "variation in human obesity - those genes", "27:54", "explain so if you look at the genetics", "27:58", "of I didn't ask how much when you said", "28:03", "that's talking yeah you gotta look at", "28:04", "please Gary um so if you look at the", "28:07", "genetics of obesity what you find is", "28:09", "that from twin studies and family", "28:12", "studies that measure the overall", "28:14", "contribution of genetics about 75% of", "28:17", "the differences in body fatness between", "28:19", "individuals is due to genetic", "28:22", "differences between those individuals so", "28:24", "you know 1995 America if you just take a", "28:28", "cross-section of people and you measure", "28:30", "how much is genes how much is", "28:32", "environment about 75% is genetic now we", "28:36", "have only identified a small proportion", "28:39", "of the specific

I refer to in my book", "28:50", "how much it's like right now I think", "28:53", "it's up to about 10%", "28:55", "it was 3% when your book was populated", "28:58", "7% absolutely yeah the latest yeah", "29:01", "actually let me cite the so well daddy", "29:04", "there now just a second I'm gonna cite", "29:05", "the study just a second monocyte the", "29:07", "study this study is under reference", "29:11", "number two so you can you can go check", "29:14", "that out it's about 10% and these", "29:16", "genetic studies are advancing very", "29:18", "quickly and that's why in the three", "29:19", "years since I wrote that we have", "29:21", "explained a lot more than we did at the", "29:24", "time that I wrote that and so we have a", "29:26", "portion of these genes identified and", "29:28", "what we're seeing is that most of that", "29:31", "portion that we have identified relates", "29:33", "to brain activity and so that tells us", "29:35", "that primarily the differences

now the um okay so drugs that", "30:13", "explain obesity 10% with the argument", "30:14", "that I was making and the argument I", "30:16", "continue to make imagine if you know", "30:19", "take Stefan's car and see Stefan he says", "30:23", "Stefan say Stefan right it's okay I'm", "30:25", "not saying it but I mean in polish just", "30:27", "people don't get confused the if you", "30:31",

"driving that but when you look at total", "38:30", "body fatness the thing that causes", "38:33", "obesity what you see is that those genes", "38:35", "are dominated by the brain and the", "38:37",

"38:55", "believe about what causes obesity this", "38:57", "is just whatever genes are popping up so", "38:59", "it's unbiased and that's what they're", "39:02", "saying and I'm not done here Gary now I", "39:04", "want to talk about you mentioned Gary", "39:07", "that maybe leptin is having important", "39:11", "actions not just in the brain but in the", "39:13", "body first of all I'm glad

the scientific", "39:54", "literature so if you knock out the", "39:57", "leptin receptor only in the brain or", "40:01", "only in the hypothalamus you get", "40:04", "obesity so that is what tells us that", "40:07", "actually the brain is the key site of", "40:09", "action and particularly the spell train", "40:11", "it tells you Gary Gary Gary please let", "40:16", "him talk you let you talk yeah and", "40:18", "that's it so I mean you get the same", "40:20", "obesity if you knock leptin out of the", "40:22", "brain and particularly out of the", "40:24", "hypothalamus that you get if you knock", "40:25", "it out of the whole body so that shows", "40:27", "that the brain is the site of action", "40:30", "that is causing this to happen and this", "40:32", "is no surprise we have these

"41:38", "little bit it's produced in fat cells", "41:40", "and it's produced in proportion to the", "41:43", "size of fat tissue so the amount of body", "41:45", "fat you have the more fat you have the", "41:48", "more leptin you have in the circulation", "41:50", "and basically what this is it's what's", "41:52", "called a negative feedback loop which is", "41:55", "a really simple engineering term that", "41:57", "works like a thermostat so with your", "41:59", "thermostat you if you set your", "42:03", "thermostat to 70 if it starts getting a", "42:06", "little bit of hotter your AC turns on to", "42:08", "bring it back down this starts getting", "42:10", "lower ac comes on or the heat comes on", "42:13", "to bring it up that's called the", "42:14", "negative feedback system it maintains", "42:16", "the stability", "42:17", "of the temperature of your house we have", "42:20", "many negative feedback loops in the", "42:22", "human body to regulate body temperature", "42:24",

"42:45", "and then particularly when your body fat", "42:48", "level drops your leptin levels drop and", "42:51", "your brain hears that and it kicks in a", "42:54", "starvation response basically and this", "42:56", "is the main reason why weight loss is so", "42:58", "difficult because your brain is like no", "43:00", "I don't want to be losing fat and it", "43:02", "makes you hungrier it increases your yes", "43:05", "is that a certain level of body fat as", "43:07", "this so here's is just when you're", "43:09", "losing body fat in general like even if", "43:11", "you a large person that's overweight", "43:13", "rekd when you're losing body fat in", "43:14", "general your body exacerbate your hunger", "43:17", "and this is this is the thing that's", "43:19", "really important to understand about", "43:20", "obesity is that people with obesity have", "43:25", "a higher setpoint so it's like turning", "43:26", "your thermostat from 70 to 80 and then", "43:29", "your thermostats are regulating around", "43:31", "80 people with obesity they're not", "43:33", "regulating around 170 anymore they're", "43:35", "regulating around 250 and so when you", "43:38", "cause a lean person to lose weight you", "43:41", "see the same thing as when you cause a", "43:42", "person with obesity to lose weight you", "43:45", "see this reaction in their brain", "43:47", "circuits that regulate body fatness that", "43:50", "drives them to increase their cravings", "43:52", "and their hunger so metabolic rate drops", "43:54", "so it would be an evolutionary mechanism", "43:56", "to force you to seek food correct", "43:58", "and not just to force you to seek food", "44:00", "that's the main thing but it also slows", "44:02", "your metabolic rate does everything it", "44:04", "can to get more energy in your body and", "44:06", "have less leaving and it keeps doing", "44:09", "that until the fat comes back tonight", "44:10", "pause here yeah so when you're eating a", "44:13", "sugary diet a high high calorie diet you", "44:16", "will produce more fat your body will get", "44:18", "fatter right umm it depends on how many", "44:21", "calories you're okay if you're", "44:22", "overeating", "44:23", "yeah I'm consuming a lot of sugar a lot", "44:25", "of carbohydrates your body will get", "44:26", "fatter your body will produce more", "44:28", "leptin correct so it comes from the diet", "44:31", "yeah indirectly definite can I pause", "44:34", "please so the leptin is produced not", "44:37", "just in response to the size of the fat", "44:39", "cell but in response actually glucose", "44:42", "mediated uptake into the fat cell which", "44:45", "is mediated in part by insulin so you", "44:46", "come back to insulin even with the left", "44:49", "and you raise blood sugar and that's the", "44:51", "carbs you eat the carbs you raise", "44:53", "Fletcher you raise insulin you raise fat", "44:55", "storage the glucose and then you get", "44:58", "more leptin again one of the things you", "45:01", "have to understand about this is", "45:02", "everything that says has two", "45:04", "interpretations depending on which", "45:06", "paradigm you're looking at and these are", "45:08", "fundamentally different paradigms so in", "45:11", "Stefan's world and again correct me if", "45:15", "I'm wrong though leptin a signalling", "45:17", "fuel availability in fat cells the way I", "45:21", "would think of it and in my very small", "45:23", "world leptin is responding to fuel", "45:26", "availability in the rest of the cells so", "45:29", "it's basically a molecule that can tell", "45:31", "other cells that there's fat available", "45:34", "and you could burn that fat for fuel and", "45:36", "then you don't have to go eat or it can", "45:38", "tell that there isn't fuel available and", "45:41", "if depending on how much left and there", "45:44", "is the cells and then that will respond", "45:46", "by a signal to eat or not to dis inhibit", "45:48", "eating behavior everything we're talking", "45:52", "about with Stefan and I first sort of", "45:54", "fell out I don't know eight years ago at", "45:58", "ancestral health symposium when I acted", "46:03", "improperly inappropriately but one of", "46:06", "the problems I to the way I think you", "46:09", "should think about this you have a", "46:10", "hypothesis and this is the fundamental", "46:13", "thing is it obesity caused by overeating", "46:15", "because we know if you're getting fatter", "46:17", "you're storing more calories in your", "46:20", "expend that's just the you know it's", "46:22", "like if a room is getting more crowded", "46:24", "more people are entering them leaving", "46:26", "that is the simplest but it doesn't tell", "46:29", "you why the rooms getting crowded it", "46:30", "doesn't tell you why you're getting", "46:33", "fatter", "46:33", "and again what I've been arguing is the", "46:35", "why you're getting fatter part has been", "46:37", "left out and people decided that", "46:39", "overeating was somehow an explanation", "46:41", "and then they went to the brain to look", "46:43", "at why people might over", "46:45", "so what I one of the questions I asked", "46:48", "to find eight years ago and it keeps", "46:49", "coming up is if we're gonna blame", "46:51", "obesity on the modern food environment", "46:53", "epidemics of obesity", "46:55", "you know simple question to ask is can", "46:59", "we find epidemics of obesity without", "47:02", "this modern food environment I mean", "47:05", "that's the sort of science 101 right and", "47:08", "it turns out that the world is following", "47:09", "the first one I found in the literature", "47:11", "was in 1902 in a population of the Pima", "47:15", "Native American tribe the Pima living in", "47:17", "Arizona and observers saying these", "47:20", "people are poor they're malnourished", "47:22", "they're suffering through famines", "47:24", "they've been suffering through a famine", "47:26", "for 40 years in famines it's hard to", "47:28", "overeat during a famine and yet the", "47:31", "women of the tribe who do virtually all", "47:33", "the work they were treated as pack", "47:35", "animals in effect were obese so now we", "47:40", "can disassociate obesity from the modern", "47:43", "food environment and we could", "47:45", "disassociate it from this", "47:48", "ultra-processed foods we eat and start", "47:51", "to ask the question what is it about can", "47:54", "we find what might have driven obesity", "47:56", "in that population despite the existence", "47:58", "of famine so it's from very simple", "48:00", "observation once we get into these kind", "48:02", "of studies say this in human genome", "48:04", "studies say that I actually rarely do", "48:10", "that in my books because you can find", "48:11", "studies that will say anything and", "48:14", "you'll see in the studies people", "48:18", "misinterpreting them what was the cause", "48:20", "of the population of women to be obese", "48:22", "well so one thing that happened during", "48:24", "the faint beginning in the 1860s the", "48:26", "Pima were put on the reserve while they", "48:28", "moved on to Reza they were reservation", "48:30", "eyes whatever the verb form would be and", "48:33", "they began eating western foods and back", "48:35", "then it was sugar flour and lard for the", "48:37", "most part and sugary beverages probably", "48:40", "so that's a reasonable hypothesis and", "48:44", "you could find the same thing in the", "48:46", "Sioux Native American Sioux population", "48:48", "living on a reservation in 1928 where", "48:50", "you had Oh both obese men and women", "48:54", "living with malnourished stunted", "48:57", "children who clear", "48:58", "when getting enough dye but they were on", "48:59", "a reservation they were getting Western", "49:01", "foods so ultimately you know the", "49:05", "question you asked in science determines", "49:07", "the answer you get so the question I was", "49:09", "asking is we have this observation that", "49:12", "any population that transitions to", "49:15", "Western diet or Western diet and", "49:18", "lifestyle gets obese and diabetic they", "49:21", "develop what's called metabolic syndrome", "49:23", "which is insulin resistance and all", "49:25", "these issues and we know that's true all", "49:28", "over the world from the Inuit to the", "49:30", "Pima to South Pacific Islanders to", "49:33", "Africans to Europeans so the genetics", "49:36", "aren't that important the question is", "49:37", "what's triggering it in the environment", "49:39", "and again Stefan would say well there's", "49:42", "too much food available and it's too", "49:46", "palatable and we can't say no and I have", "49:49", "a lot of problems with that we can say", "49:52", "no part because if we're lean it means", "49:54", "they can't say no and they being the", "49:56", "people with obesity and I don't believe", "49:58", "that's true and then or is it some", "50:01", "specific item or some so spin this these", "50:05", "foods that travel with Western", "50:07", "populations and so the exists the", "50:10", "ability and today if you look up do a", "50:14", "burden of obesity and malnutrition I", "50:17", "have a Dropbox folder I could share with", "50:18", "you that's probably 50 studies all over", "50:21", "the world you see the same observation", "50:22", "incredibly poor populations malnourished", "50:24", "the children are stunted which means", "50:27", "their protein deficient and their", "50:28", "calorie deficient and often the mothers", "50:31", "or the aunts or obese the obesity tends", "50:34", "to run in the females would suggest it", "50:37", "has a female sex hormone related a fact", "50:41", "that I don't believe works in the brain", "50:43", "because we're dealing with populations", "50:44", "that could not have over eaten if they", "50:47", "could have over eaten why are the kids", "50:50", "starving that's sort of the question and", "50:52", "you know this was the first thing that I", "50:54", "think we fought about back then and it's", "50:57", "still if you can find populations with", "51:00", "obesity epidemics but without the modern", "51:04", "food system without snack wells and", "51:07", "without Lay's potato jims", "51:10", "and if you know that they're going", "51:13", "through a famine or you know that the", "51:14", "kids at least aren't getting a food how", "51:17", "do you explain obesity and the mothers", "51:19", "without assuming that the mothers are", "51:21", "overeat let's pause right there", "51:23", "Stefan is there a population of people", "51:26", "that are obese that are not eating a", "51:29", "Western diet that are not eating sugary", "51:30", "foods that are obese and that are not", "51:36", "eating sugary foods probably not because", "51:39", "generally once you have an", "51:41",

"some of these excellent let's talk about", "51:51", "back to the yeah sure let's talk about", "51:54", "the Pima first now Gary has told a story", "51:57", "he's told his version of the Pima story", "52:00", "let me tell the story the version of the", "52:02", "story that appears in the scientific", "52:04", "literature", "52:04", "now the Pima originally they were", "52:08", "agriculturalists they were eating", "52:10", "traditionally a very high carbohydrate", "52:13", "diet based on unrefined carbohydrates", "52:15", "originally it was corn beans and squash", "52:18", "primarily they were hunter-gatherers and", "52:20", "agricultural they were primarily gary", "52:23", "okay they were primarily eating", "52:25", "agricultural foods they were also", "52:27", "collecting some wild foods that's", "52:29", "correct they were fishing and eating", "52:33", "mesquite pods primarily agricultural and", "52:37", "data are very clear on that Gary so yes", "52:41", "they are look we have data I can't say", "52:44", "things like that nothing because we're", "52:45", "going to disagree let's move on you", "52:48", "think they mostly fish that's incorrect", "52:50", "okay according to the data that's I", "52:52", "remember you saying that in your book", "52:54", "something to that effect that's and", "52:55", "agree but you've got my book anyway", "52:58", "let's go on we don't better I'm gonna", "53:01", "move on here now the Pima traditionally", "53:06", "were agriculturalists and what happened", "53:08", "basically is you had all these farmers", "53:10", "moving into their area settlers of", "53:13", "European descent and they diverted the", "53:16", "water from their River the Gila or Gila", "53:19", "River if you open up Gila and so they", "53:22", "were no longer able to grow there", "53:24", "drops their agricultural crops that they", "53:26", "were primarily dependent on and", "53:27", "therefore the government started", "53:29", "providing them with foods to eat and", "53:31", "these were calorie dense refined foods", "53:34", "they were like Gary said flour lard and", "53:38", "sugar and then they became very obese", "53:42", "when out there was a population of Pima", "53:44", "right across the border from them in", "53:46", "Mexico also very similar culturally and", "53:49", "all that that maintained their", "53:50", "traditional high carbohydrate lifestyle", "53:53", "an agricultural lifestyle and there have", "53:55", "been studies comparing those two", "53:56", "populations and the ones across the", "54:00", "border with their traditional lifestyle", "54:02", "are a lot leaner and healthier not", "54:05", "surprisingly than the ones eating lard", "54:06", "flour and sugar okay but Gary you seem", "54:10", "to believe that people can gain weight", "54:12", "you kept referring to famines and things", "54:14", "you seem to believe that people can gain", "54:15", "weight even if they are eating very few", "54:19", "calories and you refer to this many", "54:21", "times in your writing and you know these", "54:24", "are very casual observations that you're", "54:27", "making kind of these casual correlations", "54:30", "and storytelling but if you actually", "54:32", "look at the data on this what you see is", "54:36", "that if you just measure calorie intake", "54:39", "and people who have obesity it is 20 to", "54:43", "35 percent higher than people who are", "54:45", "lean after correcting for height", "54:48", "physical activity level and that I've", "54:50", "got references right we're getting a", "54:54", "little bit in seconds here let me give", "54:56", "you an agrarian umber seven what can I", "54:58", "pause you guys right here so these", "55:00", "people they have essentially the same", "55:03", "lineage one group lives in Mexico they", "55:05", "they're not eating these sugary foods", "55:08", "and this Western diet the ones that live", "55:11", "in America are the ones that live in", "55:12", "America are becoming obese the ones that", "55:14", "live in Mexico or not is that correct", "55:15", "correct yeah and so now if you have", "55:18", "someone with obesity like I've said the", "55:21", "most accurate measures that we have", "55:24", "suggests that they habitually consume", "55:27", "and expend more calories and now Gary's", "55:30", "model says that that is downstream of", "55:32", "the fattening effect it's not causing", "55:34", "the fattening effect it is a result of", "55:37", "the", "55:37", "effect whereas my model says that that", "55:40", "is actually required for the fattening", "55:42", "effect to occur it is upstream so now", "55:44", "what happened though what happens there", "55:46", "what happens if you reduce their calorie", "55:50", "intake by that same amount twenty to", "55:52", "thirty five percent it doesn't matter if", "55:54", "you do it by restricting carbs or fat", "55:56", "these experiments have been done they", "55:59", "lose weight when you restrict their", "56:01", "calorie intake down to that this is the", "56:03", "argument what you're saying that you", "56:05", "keep consuming low amounts of calories", "56:07", "but high amounts of sugar does it", "56:10", "doesn't make sense you can get obese", "56:11", "that way so you're saying it's a calorie", "56:14", "yeah correct and that's reference number", "56:16", "nine and ten to support what I just said", "56:19", "and I want to talk about another one", "56:20", "that right wait can we out on stage its", "56:22", "but I the reason I was using the dual", "56:24", "burden example is because we have to", "56:28", "explain how those women were eating all", "56:30", "those calories usually women again it's", "56:32", "just often they was interrupting these", "56:35", "studies were done by diabetes", "56:37", "researchers that were studying diabetes", "56:39", "in these populations and the men had", "56:40", "high levels of diabetes and the women", "56:42", "had high levels of obesity to give you", "56:46", "an example where that measurement was", "56:48", "done um in Trinidad in the nineteen", "56:50", "sixties and again all I'm doing this is", "56:53", "the role I played as I asked the", "56:54", "question can you find populations that", "56:56", "don't have a lot of food okay you could", "56:58", "say that the

us can you find a", "57:07", "population that gets obese without sugar", "57:09", "which was exactly the question to ask", "57:11", "so in Trinidad in the 1960s as a", "57:13", "malnutrition crisis

one study in", "63:31", "particular and see I'm gonna give you a", "63:34", "number here see if I can give you a", "63:39", "number here sorry", "63:40", "while you look at that um can we bring", "63:44", "up another issue because what we're", "63:45", "talking about ultimately is why people", "63:47", "get fat okay I don't I don't want to", "63:49", "divert here I'm in the middle of", "63:50", "something so um now if we want to", "63:54", "understand why people get fat we can", "63:57", "look at studies that overfed people on", "64:00", "fat or carbohydrates exclusively so this", "64:02", "one study the first one that I want to", "64:05", "talk about first they figured out", "64:07", "people's baseline calorie intake figure", "64:10", "out how many calories they needed just",

Horton", "64:22", "okay um yeah so number 16 number 16 so", "64:29", "now if Gary's hypothesis is correct", "64:32", "these people should have gained body fat", "64:35", "on the carbohydrate overfeeding but not", "64:38", "the fat overfeeding because that", "64:40", "increases your insulin has these effects", "64:41", "on your fat cells etc okay now these", "64:44", "were very rigorous studies I want to", "64:46", "emphasize that and I pause here did they", "64:47", "monitor the the actual calories they got", "64:50", "correct yes they were they were they had", "64:53", "a baseline they use prisoners and they", "64:55", "per month state prison no that's", "64:57", "incorrect different study so they had a", "65:00", "baseline and did they require them to", "65:02", "maintain the same diet and then add", "65:04", "additional fat or additional", "65:05", "carbohydrates yes and then they just", "65:10", "bump it up with fat way way up with", "65:12", "carbohydrate Horten there wasn't Sims it", "65:15", "was Ethan Sims what's the money that was", "65:17", "which study did you do that was not", "65:19", "prisoners what was the he didn't have a", "65:22", "metabolic you know what let me just", "65:23", "finish describing this study not Gary", "65:26", "that's an irrelevant detail okay it", "65:27", "what's relevant is that you just didn't", "65:29", "implied that I don't know we're talking", "65:32", "a parry alright you know what", "65:33", "I don't actually know maybe it was in", "65:36", "prisoners thank you all right you're", "65:38", "welcome now but it was not the Sims", "65:42", "overfeeding study that was done in", "65:44", "prisoners that's what I know okay okay", "65:45", "so and what's a reference yeah it's on", "65:48", "my website you can go to my website", "65:50", "stefan Guillen a calm and it's reference", "65:53", "number sixteen and they're both there", "65:55", "okay so this was what's called a", "65:57", "metabolic Ward study where these people", "65:59", "were in a research facility where the", "66:01", "researchers could monitor and control", "66:03", "every morsel of food so there was no", "66:06", "cheating no inaccuracy and they were", "66:09", "measuring changes in body fatness using", "66:11", "a gold standard method called underwater", "66:13", "weighing okay and so what they found was", "66:17", "that at the end of a two-week period of", "66:19", "over feeding the carb and the fat groups", "66:22", "gained the exact same amount of body fat", "66:24", "exact same amount of body fat", "66:27", "there was another

found the exact same", "66:38", "thing same amount of fat gain different", "66:40", "insulin responses different amounts of", "66:42", "carbohydrates", "66:43", "that exact same amount of fat gain so", "66:46", "this demonstrates that insulin is not", "66:48", "and carbs are not what controls what", "66:51", "gets fat into fat tissue calorie intake", "66:54", "is what controls that so let me explain", "66:56", "again remember I talked about everything", "66:58", "the paradigm you work and determines the", "67:00", "question you ask and this experiment is", "67:03", "a classic example because they assume", "67:05", "that people get fat by overfeeding so", "67:07", "then they say if we over feed them we're", "67:11", "just doing what happens naturally", "67:12", "everything about the experiment is based", "67:15", "on the assumption that they're supposed", "67:17", "to be testing which is can people get", "67:19", "fat by overfeeding and so that from the", "67:23", "very conception of the experiment", "67:25", "they've built in the paradigm that we", "67:27", "want to test the hypothesis on top of it", "67:30", "if it's a typical Simmons experiment I", "67:32", "actually wasn't familiar with this one", "67:34", "Oh was a it wasn't Simms was a James O", "67:38", "and JC Peter James Hill was funded for", "67:42", "the from about 1998 to about 2008 by", "67:47", "Procter & Gamble because he was in", "67:49", "olestra shil I hate to say that Jim I", "67:52", "apologize but I think it's a fair", "67:54", "assessment and then when he stopped", "67:56",

"something that no one needs yeah Lester", "68:08", "was a fat substitute and the problem was", "68:10", "he got like run out like that but the", "68:14", "whole idea of olestra was to replace fat", "68:18", "in the diet so every study Helen Peters", "68:21", "did implicated dietary fat as a cause of", "68:23", "obesity I don't think we could ever use", "68:25", "I hate to say and I mean typically I", "68:27", "I don't think funding influences results", "68:30", "but I wouldn't use in James Hill study", "68:32", "to make that point that because you", "68:36", "think it's a bio study that was in", "68:38", "everything hell everything Helen Peters", "68:40", "did can anyone knows I mean I talked", "68:42", "about this in good calories bad calories", "68:44", "when they reported their results", "68:45", "actually I did a FOIA on James Hill cuz", "68:48", "he works for the University of Colorado", "68:49", "so you could actually and I got all his", "68:51", "documents back and forth between him and", "68:53", "a lesser I'd be happy to share them with", "68:55", "you if you'd like there", "68:56", "Rabelais timing him and Procter & Gamble", "68:59", "but he basically held Procter and Gamble", "69:01", "for ransom he would get a $500,000", "69:03", "unrestricted gift and then he would do a", "69:06", "study and then he would ask and it would", "69:09", "conclude that fat is bad and carbs are", "69:12", "good and therefore olestra is a viable", "69:14", "product then he would ask for Procter", "69:17", "and Gamble for more money before he then", "69:19", "published study so it's a particularly", "69:23", "egregious example of someone who's I", "69:26", "suspect it was just his belief system he", "69:28", "believed dietary fat was bad fat causes", "69:30", "obesity olestra is a good thing because", "69:33", "you eat that instead of fat you don't", "69:34", "absorb it and in every study he did", "69:37", "confirm that the point that we keep", "69:42", "getting away from that I haven't had an", "69:43", "opportunity to and Stefan knows as well", "69:48", "as I do if you're gaining say four", "69:51", "pounds a year of fat let's say between", "69:53", "20 and 40 you've put on 40 extra pounds", "69:56", "so now you're obese or nice lean healthy", "69:58", "young guy in 20 like many of us wore and", "70:01", "by the time you're 40", "70:02", "you've got 40 pounds of excess fat", "70:04", "that's the equivalent of putting in", "70:07", "about the 10 calories as head storing", "70:11", "about 10 calories a day into your fat", "70:13",

"70:27", "your fat tissue less than a bites worth", "70:29", "of food less than a sips worth of beer", "70:33", "so the question are actually trying to", "70:36", "ask is or answer and this is again just", "70:38", "my approach is a curious journalists do", "70:41", "with a science background this how do we", "70:43", "explain those 10 calories because when", "70:45", "we talk about those obese women with", "70:47", "starving children all those obese woman", "70:49", "were doing was storing 10 or 20 calories", "70:52", "a day depending on how quickly they", "70:54", "became obese and those populations that", "70:56", "tends to happen quickly in their 20s so", "71:00", "we're asking this question how do we if", "71:03", "you've got a situation where we have to", "71:05", "end up with 10 calories stuck in the fat", "71:07", "cells every day that's a 20 34", "71:10", "a billion fat cells so it's divided up", "71:12", "very small and is the brain somehow", "71:15", "regulating that or again is there dis", "71:18", "regulation in the body involving pick", "71:22", "your hormones pick your enzymes when", "71:25", "knowing that somehow traps fat in the", "71:28", "fat cells or prevents the fat from being", "71:31", "used for fuel when it's released from", "71:34", "the fat cells and so if you think about", "71:37", "it that way like you let yourself go to", "71:39", "seed", "71:40", "today Joe Rogan decides I'm done I'm", "71:43", "gonna do nothing but drink beer and you", "71:44", "might start drinking five beers a day", "71:46", "and over the course of 10 years you get", "71:48", "20 pounds and it's all here that 20", "71:52", "pounds over the course of 10 years it's", "71:53", "still only about 20 calories you might", "71:55", "have added 800 calories of beer to your", "71:57", "diet and stored 20 calories as fat how", "72:02", "does that happen and why does it go here", "72:04", "and not elsewhere and as Stefan said", "72:08", "this is insulin dependent fat tissue so", "72:12", "those are that's when we're talking", "72:14", "about this like this question could", "72:15", "somebody get fat during a famine or can", "72:18", "they stay fat during a famine all they", "72:20", "have to do is hold on to ten calories a", "72:23", "day extra if they're only eating 1210", "72:27", "gets stuck in their fat cells 1190 is", "72:31", "excreted or expended it's not that hard", "72:34", "to imagine and there's nothing in the", "72:37", "laws of physics that says it so what", "72:38", "could be dysregulated about their fat", "72:40", "cells even during a relative famine not", "72:43", "a complete famine but a relative famine", "72:45", "that might be and again animal", "72:48", "experiments of which there are probably", "72:50", "hundreds by now different animal models", "72:53", "you can disassociate obesity from hype", "72:57", "from eating too much in the animal can I", "72:59", "pause you for a second", "73:00", "so essentially you're saying that even", "73:02", "if someone is taking in a a good amount", "73:07", "of calories a smart amount of calories", "73:09", "2,000 calories a day if you're taking in", "73:12", "these calories in the form of sugar your", "73:15", "body is going to take a certain", "73:18", "percentage of them even if you're", "73:19", "getting enough food and stored as fat", "73:21", "whereas if you were taking in too", "73:24", "protein and vegetables and things along", "73:28", "those lines your body would not do that", "73:29", "well so this is a gets to the mechanism", "73:32", "yes and and the evidence question but", "73:35", "you're saying that right so you're", "73:36", "saying that if two people are on the", "73:38", "same diet one of us on two thousand", "73:40", "calories of chicken and fish and", "73:42", "vegetables and the other one is on two", "73:44", "thousand calories of milkshakes and you", "73:48", "know sugary drinks and pasta and", "73:51", "bullshit that that person is going to", "73:54", "gain a certain amount of calories and", "73:56", "just put them to fat right regardless", "73:58", "that's yeah that's I've seen a city this", "74:03", "being a science that hypothesis can be", "74:04", "tested yes and there's Stefan thinks", "74:07", "it's been tested I think it's they've", "74:11", "done a bad job of testing it and we will", "74:15", "both tend to reject the studies that we", "74:17", "don't like when we define don't like by", "74:19", "whether or not they got the answer we", "74:21", "think it's your perspective that this is", "74:23", "not the case your perspective is that", "74:24", "like as you were saying in this study", "74:26", "with a closely monitored these people's", "74:28", "diets and they added an additional fat", "74:30", "and an additional carbohydrates that", "74:33", "they both gained the same additional", "74:35", "amount of work that's right I mean if", "74:36", "this is correct you have to see", "74:40", "different levels of fat gain I mean Gary", "74:41", "short-term studies yeah it was short", "74:44", "term wasn't two in three weeks that's", "74:46", "very short yeah it is very short term", "74:48", "but still bonus yeah he says that", "74:50", "insulin is the thing that gets fat in", "74:53", "fat cells and that I mean you would see", "74:55", "some kind of difference that insulin", "74:56", "made any difference it should have seen", "74:58", "some kind of effect right some kind of", "75:00", "difference in fact games well actually", "75:02", "um I don't want to start taking out", "75:04", "charts but this gets into insulin", "75:06", "dynamics that was worked out so over a", "75:09", "hey I promised I wasn't gonna say oh boy", "75:15", "boy on the show but it's my thanks to my", "75:18", "Brooklyn born mother it's my program", "75:22", "then um and they the same is true a lot", "75:26", "of these overfeeding experiments do the", "75:27", "same thing so when they talk about", "75:29", "overfeeding they they they literally", "75:32", "over feed so they kind do reasonable way", "75:35", "of figuring out which reading is Stefan", "75:37", "said they measure", "75:38",

"83:36", "thing that's not the point", "83:38", "yeah thank you okay now what you see", "83:43", "there's basically two things you need to", "83:45", "pay attention to here in terms of", "83:47", "energetics one is the imbalance between", "83:50", "intake and expenditure and that is very", "83:53", "small", "83:53", "so it only takes a little bit of extra", "83:55", "calories to cause somebody to start", "83:57", "gaining fat however as they gain fat", "84:00", "their bodies get bigger they're gaining", "84:02", "fat and lean mass people with obesity", "84:05", "have more fat more lean mass

small their", "84:18", "calorie needs end up being quite a bit", "84:20", "higher can I pause for a sec yeah so", "84:22", "you're saying that someone just gaining", "84:24", "calories eating additional calories", "84:26", "their body gains lean mass as well", "84:28", "that's as fast as the brain regulate the", "84:31", "I didn't say it regular so fascinating", "84:35", "but how does the three muscle muscle", "84:37", "through gaining muscle to some of its", "84:39", "muscles some of its okay as they're", "84:43", "carrying around this extra weight and so", "84:46", "the extra calories and then on top of", "84:48", "that carrying around the extra weight", "84:50", "forces their body to grow larger", "84:52", "presumably I'm actually not sure what", "84:54", "the mechanism is but it doesn't have", "84:56", "nothing to do with the brain that's a", "84:58", "coincidence I don't know what it causes", "85:00", "it that's what I'm saying Gary okay now", "85:04", "so so but the point is by the time the", "85:08", "person has obesity they are consuming", "85:11", "twenty to thirty five percent more", "85:13", "calories than they were when they were", "85:16", "lean so that's not just a one or two", "85:18", "cokes a day that is allowing them to", "85:22", "remain obese they are consuming twenty", "85:24", "to thirty five percent more calories", "85:26", "that is

"amount of extra calories and it's not a", "85:38", "generalization because we don't know I", "85:40", "mean what's the ratio of how much fat", "85:42", "people get how much weight people are",

"85:51", "people get fat they get 20 pounds", "85:54", "overweight people get fat they get a", "85:55", "hundred pounds overweight they mean yeah", "85:57", "that's right yeah and that's why I give", "85:58", "a range because what you see is that", "86:00", "people who are overweight so they're in", "86:03", "the overweight range and just have some", "86:05", "extra fat they eat about ten percent", "86:07", "extra calories people who have a little", "86:09", "bit of obesity eat about twenty percent", "86:11", "extra calories people who have who are", "86:13", "very have very very great obesity eat", "86:16", "more like 35 percent so it tracks with", "86:18", "the amount I'm sorry is it possible what", "86:21", "he was saying that if you do consume 10", "86:23", "extra calories over long periods of time", "86:25", "that will accumulate no it's not extra", "86:27", "calories you're accumulating than 10", "86:29", "hours that said like Kent a dime is", "86:32", "going it is saying so how much do you", "86:34", "have to deposit is credit on right it is", "86:36", "correct that if every day you eat 10", "86:40", "calories more than what you need then", "86:42", "yes or your body so your body stores", "86:45", "yeah", "86:45", "we'll say that that's coring 10 percent", "86:49", "10 10 extra calories over top of what", "86:52", "you need but the thing is that as you", "86:54", "get bigger what you need goes up and up", "86:56", "and up because you're carrying around", "86:57", "more correct and so it's ten percent in", "87:00", "ten extra Cal it's re not percent it's", "87:01", "ten extra calories on top of the", "87:05", "elevated amount that you're already", "87:07", "eating so you end up with these big", "87:09", "differences in calories to take so", "87:12", "that's how that's how it really works", "87:13", "but I want to talk about some", "87:15", "interesting observations because Gary", "87:17", "you like to talk about you know what's", "87:20", "going on in different dietary trends and", "87:22", "different cultures and I find that", "87:24", "pretty interesting too I want to talk", "87:26", "about the fact that sugar intake in the", "87:30", "United States has been declining for the", "87:32", "last 20 years so it peaked in 1999 and", "87:36", "it is currently depending on which", "87:38", "source of evidence you believe 15 to 23",

percentage", "88:01", "yeah and in UK sugar intake has been", "88:04", "declining for 50 years I don't believe", "88:07", "that okay well you can argue with the", "88:09", "data there number 17 on my blog there", "88:12", "about 22 percent lower and this is what", "88:15", "we see across a number of different", "88:17", "industrialized countries you see a", "88:19", "stagnation or decline in sugar

I'll let", "88:42", "you respond for me because we had this", "88:43", "debate with the Cato foundation to you", "88:46", "know my art counter argument you want to", "88:47", "give it yeah sure absolutely I mean are", "88:51", "you sure you want to let me give it", "88:52", "though I might correct it okay all right", "88:55", "so your counter-argument is that", "88:59", "the amount of sugar that we consumed 20", "89:03", "years ago or even maybe 50 years ago", "89:05", "maybe continuing to fatten us today and", "89:09", "it's about the sugar that we used to eat", "89:11", "20 or 50 years ago and not necessarily", "89:14", "about the sugar we eat today well it's", "89:16", "not exactly right okay I guess so the", "89:19", "argument I made was because he brought", "89:21", "this up and

the assumption that Stephan", "89:51", "is making when he quotes this kind of", "89:52", "data is that the relationship between", "89:54", "sugar and obesity is linear so as sugar", "89:58", "goes up

years so you just use the Kuhn", "104:28", "as an example of a population he's a lot", "104:30", "of sugar and stated it dogmatically but", "104:33", "a lot of sugar is 32 pounds a year and",

find this because", "116:12", "they were they were not walking as much", "116:14", "yeah I was the exercise and also just", "116:16", "their diet became richer again I mean if", "116:18", "you're

you on", "124:50", "this is that refined carbohydrates and", "124:53", "sugar are the most fattening type of", "124:55", "carbohydrate that we can agree on oh my", "124:57", "god we came to an

20 studies they'll", "143:53", "be just like the Jim Hill study they", "143:55", "assumed energy balance was the cause and", "143:58", "then they wanted to see what caused", "144:00", "energy

essentially", "145:20", "your arguments primarily rely on", "145:21", "historical narratives and speculation", "145:24", "and there's very little of actually", "145:26", "saying what is the most

know I'm", "145:37", "gonna try to say this in a non insulting", "145:40", "way but I will simply say that others", "145:42", "who have looked at the same historical", "145:44", "evidence have come to

let me just say B's in", "146:06", "track because here we're gonna wrap this", "146:07", "up soon so we've really got near three", "146:10", "hours almost um remember when you drove", "146:13", "up here from San Diego this morning and", "146:15", "I was listening to Stefan on a different", "146:17", "podcast and you were talking about how", "146:19", "you are eating behavior differed on low",
