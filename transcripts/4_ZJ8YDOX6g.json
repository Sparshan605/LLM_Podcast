I'm", "00:30", "sure it doesn't sound that odd that's", "00:32", "not certainly not embarrassing so I", "00:34", "don't know why embarrassed by eyes", "00:35", "watering if you're nervous okay thanks", "00:38", "for being here I really appreciate it I", "00:39", "am super at always happy to come well", "00:42", "we've been talking and we've been", "00:44", "talking about immune systems and this is", "00:47", "one of the main things that I wanted to", "00:48", "talk to you about like what are this", "00:49", "trick is this all we're hearing is", "00:51", "shelter in place where I'm asked don't", "00:53", "touch anybody don't go outside we're not", "00:56", "hearing what can you do to strengthen", "00:59", "your immune system and I think that as a", "01:01", "public health a public service you know", "01:04", "a health thing this is one of the most", "01:08", "important things that I think you can", "01:10", "really focus and concentrate on and an", "01:12", "actual thing that you could be proactive", "01:13", "about during this weird time yeah well", "01:16", "definitely I think focusing on on you", "01:20", "know lifestyle factors that you can you", "01:23", "know possibly modulate your immune", "01:25", "system and strengthen it is important", "01:27", "what's interesting is that the immune", "01:30", "system is you know after doing just so", "01:33", "much of course the past like couple of", "01:35", "months I've been nothing but like", "01:36", "reading about the immune system and", "01:37", "trying to understand of course this new", "01:40", "virus Irish cough too but I've just", "01:43", "learned so much you know over the past", "01:46", "couple of months", "01:46", "I'm not an immunologist I'm not an", "01:48", "infectious disease expert so you know", "01:51", "while I've had some training in", "01:52", "immunology I definitely you know didn't", "01:55", "know don't know everything there is to", "01:56", "know but what just you know doing some", "01:58", "some reading about like why are people's", "02:01", "immune systems so different like that's", "02:02", "that's the big thing like when you take", "02:04", "like a young population as you get older", "02:06", "your immune system does decline I mean", "02:08", "there's lots of changes that occur but", "02:10", "like in general like people have", "02:12", "different immunes", "02:13", "and what's interesting is that there's", "02:15", "been tons of like genetic studies done", "02:17", "on like you know identical twins and", "02:19", "they're followed over time and what's", "02:21", "found is that genetics is not the major", "02:23", "regulator of immune function it's", "02:26", "something in the environment and what", "02:28", "this is what surprised me and and it's", "02:30", "not totally it going to answer your", "02:31", "question but I will we can totally get", "02:33", "to that but the main one of the main", "02:35", "things besides age that regulates immune", "02:37", "system is like previous exposure to", "02:39", "viruses like so I thought that was", "02:43", "really interesting and in particular one", "02:44", "one virus the asite o matic megalo virus", "02:47", "CMV did you know like between 50 to 80", "02:49", "percent of the u.s. population has it", "02:52", "like at least by the time they're like", "02:53", "an adult has it permanently or it's a", "02:56", "it's a herpes virus so it's a lifelong", "02:59", "thing and this is why it basically so it", "03:01", "changes your immune system what are the", "03:03", "symptoms of it most people that are", "03:05", "healthy don't ever know they have it", "03:06", "because there's no symptoms whoa yeah", "03:08", "unless you're immunocompromised but most", "03:10", "people that are healthy they don't know", "03:12", "you know that they're infected with it", "03:14", "what's it again what is it", "03:15", "cytomegalovirus its CMV sounds like", "03:18", "something Godzilla fights there it is so", "03:21", "when so interest but here's the", "03:23", "interesting thing about this virus is", "03:25", "that it so this is one of the major", "03:28", "things multiple studies have been", "03:30", "looking at like you know just immune", "03:31", "variability and it's like CMV has been", "03:34", "identified in multiple studies and the", "03:36", "thing that the reason it got me", "03:37", "interested because I was like 80 almost", "03:39", "80 percent I mean I could have it right", "03:40", "right totally have it and it changes the", "03:45", "immune function it's totally different", "03:46", "between young and old so so when you're", "03:48", "younger and if you have it it actually", "03:51", "enhances immune function so they've done", "03:53", "studies where like they they they have", "03:54", "given people influenza vaccine and", "03:57", "oftentimes these vaccine studies are", "04:00", "used to kind of test the immune response", "04:01", "and like how you're how robust your", "04:03", "immune response is because you're you're", "04:06", "given a vaccine and there's all", "04:07", "different types of vaccines you know", "04:08", "pieces of an antigen or all the", "04:11", "different types of you know ways that", "04:12", "you can you can expose someone to a", "04:15", "bacteria or virus but you have a", "04:18", "response to it and the response is a you", "04:20", "know involves your adaptive immunity you", "04:22", "making what's called neutralizing", "04:23", "antibodies that you know basically", "04:25", "eventually", "04:27", "to the virus and neutralize it prevent", "04:28", "it proponent from entering the cell so", "04:30", "people without have CMV their young have", "04:33", "a really robust response to the vaccine", "04:35", "much better but older people have the", "04:38", "complete opposite where it's like you", "04:40", "know delete arias and the reason for", "04:42", "that scientists think is because", "04:44", "basically this virus it's it's stuck", "04:49", "with you life long and and it kind of", "04:51", "reactivates every few years and like", "04:54", "every time it reactivates it kind of", "04:56", "trains your t-cells you know which are", "04:58", "part of your immune system to become", "05:00", "focused on that CMV and so as you get", "05:03", "older your your t-cell population", "05:05", "becomes more focused on fighting that", "05:07", "virus and less so on other viruses that", "05:10", "you're exposed to", "05:11", "but this virus doesn't have any symptoms", "05:13", "most healthy people don't have any", "05:15", "symptoms with it I know it's really like", "05:17", "it's really weird so what I'm wondering", "05:19", "and the reason I'm even like going here", "05:21", "it and it has nothing to do with you", "05:23", "know taking vitamin C or zinc and we can", "05:25", "talk about all that stuff and vitamin D", "05:26", "but I just thought it was so damn", "05:28", "interesting because we hear all these", "05:31", "stories in the news where you know some", "05:33", "people are asymptomatic some people are", "05:36", "you know then some people are just", "05:38", "really getting you know hard-hit and and", "05:40", "these people let's say they're more", "05:42", "age-matched right we know that elderly", "05:43", "people are more prone to a severe form", "05:46", "but it just made me think what if this", "05:49", "you know previous previous viral", "05:51", "exposure to something like CMV is is", "05:54", "kind of like also kind of shaping", "05:56", "people's immune responses in some way", "05:57", "surely people are gonna be looking", "05:59", "looking at that but I just thought that", "06:01", "was a really interesting thing to come", "06:03", "across you know and then the other sort", "06:06", "of on the same on the same law along the", "06:08", "same lines as previous you know previous", "06:10", "virus exposure is like something that", "06:12", "really seems to be something that is a", "06:14", "main regulator of how people like what", "06:17", "how your immune you know what your", "06:19", "immune response is you know and so so", "06:22", "you mean by how many times you've caught", "06:24", "the flu how many times you've had", "06:26", "whether you hang on to it how you", "06:27", "respond to it you know yeah I mean like", "06:29", "you if you get the flu is it gonna not", "06:31", "is it like a three-day kind of thing or", "06:33", "is it gonna knock you out for two weeks", "06:34", "kind of thing that's what I mean right", "06:36", "so I mean if you if you get a sample", "06:39", "like there's been these", "06:40", "Syrio surveys where they basically that", "06:43", "just means they both don't get a sample", "06:45", "of plasma and look for different", "06:46", "antibodies viral antibodies and they'll", "06:48", "find at any given points a person has", "06:50", "like antibodies against ten different", "06:52", "viruses just randomly you know so you're", "06:54", "constantly being exposed to viruses you", "06:56", "don't you're not always", "06:57", "you just don't succumb to them right", "06:59", "you're not always getting sick and so um", "07:00", "you know like another really interesting", "07:04", "kind of thing is like you know there's", "07:07", "so the Sarge Cove - virus it's part of a", "07:11", "family of corona viruses called the beta", "07:13", "corona viruses so Stars Cove one the", "07:15", "virus that was responsible for the", "07:18", "original SARS outbreak in 2002 or", "07:20", "something the mayor's one in the Middle", "07:22", "East and then there's two different ones", "07:24", "that are responsible for the common cold", "07:27", "now corona viruses are only responsible", "07:29", "between like 15 to 30 percent of common", "07:31", "cold cases so it's not like the common", "07:34", "cold is the illness you get but there's", "07:36", "lots of different viruses that can cause", "07:37", "it but what's interesting is that", "07:40", "there's been studies showing that these", "07:42", "two beta corona viruses that are", "07:43", "responsible for some of the common cold", "07:45", "cross-react with so there's one that", "07:49", "cross reacts with the SARS cove one", "07:51", "which has it varies it's very the", "07:54", "sequence is very homologous to harsh co2", "07:58", "virus and it's also been showed that the", "08:01", "Stars Cove wanted antibodies against the", "08:03", "Stars code one can neutralize the common", "08:06", "cold one so there's like cross immunity", "08:08", "happening between these other viruses", "08:10", "right and so there's been some studies", "08:13", "by the CDC on Sarge Cove to where they", "08:16", "found basically that people that are", "08:19", "infected with SARS cough to also boost", "08:22", "their antibodies against the the common", "08:25", "cold one so you know there's there", "08:27", "certainly I think a good hypothesis to", "08:30", "be made that potentially you know one or", "08:33", "two of these common cold viruses could", "08:35", "the antibodies you make against them", "08:36", "could also somehow maybe maybe you know", "08:39", "interact with the sashko to by risk", "08:42", "potentially neutralize it I mean that's", "08:43", "a big open question that seems possible", "08:47", "without we don't have any answer to that", "08:49", "I think we will like there's large", "08:51", "there's large-scale cereal surveys being", "08:54", "done I know at least three that I think", "08:58", "his name is dr. Michael Bush she's at", "09:00", "UCSF he's like he's doing like really", "09:02", "large surveys where they're there", "09:05", "they're going to be analyzing Sarah from", "09:07", "people from like you know blood donors", "09:08", "and stuff and like following them over", "09:10", "the course of several years to see you", "09:12", "know just basically understand more so", "09:15", "now what is the speculation if there's", "09:17", "any sort of uniform speculation as to", "09:20", "why when you hear about prisons where a", "09:22", "lot of these prisoners I don't know if", "09:24", "you've seen that there's a video going", "09:26", "around where one prisoner had saw Sora's", "09:29", "Cove 2 Co vid 19 whatever and spitting", "09:33", "into a cup and then passing it around to", "09:36", "all these other inmates so they could", "09:37", "all get it so that they get released", "09:40", "so these because they're releasing", "09:42", "people especially California which is so", "09:44", "wacky they're releasing sex offenders", "09:45", "and there's been some really", "09:47", "high-profile releases of these horrible", "09:50", "people that should be in jail probably", "09:51", "forever and they're releasing them it's", "09:53", "like it it's really disturbing but what", "09:56", "would cause other than something like", "09:58", "that what would cause all these", "10:01", "prisoners to not just be positive that", "10:04", "makes sense but to all be asymptomatic", "10:06", "is there any speculation as to why large", "10:09", "these large groups there was another one", "10:11", "that was a meatpacking plant where most", "10:13", "of the people were asymptomatic as well", "10:15", "I wasn't I wasn't aware of the", "10:16", "meatpacking one being asymptomatic but", "10:19", "the I did read about the one in prison", "10:20", "and it was like blowing my mind like", "10:22", "what a person like what's going on like", "10:24", "that's insane it's kind of like you read", "10:26", "these stories so so this is like there's", "10:28", "one thing that it's important to keep in", "10:30", "mind when we say asymptomatic like you", "10:33", "know there's asymptomatic in like a", "10:34", "person that never actually gets symptoms", "10:36", "right and then there's asymptomatic so", "10:38", "there was a study done at the CDC I", "10:40", "don't know a month ago maybe a little", "10:42", "more where they they measured like they", "10:45", "did it they did this nasal pharyngeal", "10:46", "swab test in a nursing home 70 something", "10:49", "people and 13 of them tested", "10:54", "asymptomatic like they had no symptoms", "10:55", "but they tested positive but then they", "10:57", "went back a week later and ten of those", "10:59", "people had symptoms than three", "11:01", "asymptomatic so unless like there's", "11:04", "another like if you test someone and", "11:06", "they're asymptomatic at that time", "11:07", "testing they could be pre-symptomatic", "11:09", "right in other words like you have to go", "11:11", "back a week later hmm and see if they", "11:14", "have symptoms right because that that's", "11:15", "really important so so let's say even", "11:17", "you know you know 60% were asymptomatic", "11:20", "like I don't know if they went back and", "11:22", "tested a week later if it was just like", "11:23", "a single time but that's what that's", "11:26", "what this is what got me thinking about", "11:27", "this whole thing was you know in in the", "11:29", "prisons and jails I mean they're in", "11:31", "close quarters and they're you got one", "11:33", "virus that someone's exposed to you and", "11:34", "they all get it right so like what if", "11:37", "there's I don't know the CMV you know", "11:39", "percentage there but what if the corona", "11:41", "viruses are going around there what if", "11:43", "what if you know some some common cold", "11:45", "corona virus has gone around and that", "11:47", "you know those antibodies that they've", "11:48", "made to neutralize that corner beta", "11:50", "corona virus are somehow helping with", "11:53", "the Sarge Cove too like I would love to", "11:54", "see that tested do you know they", "11:58", "immunize people did vaccinate people", "12:01", "when they go into jail I was trying to", "12:03", "figure that out as well because like the", "12:05", "tuberculosis about tuberculosis one of", "12:08", "the types of vaccines they do for TB I", "12:10", "think they do it in like Japan and some", "12:14", "other countries where they've got a", "12:15", "really low death rate and so they're", "12:17", "kind of that's a test that's a clinical", "12:19", "trial that's now going on where they're", "12:20", "trying to test but I was trying to", "12:22", "figure out is there a vaccination I", "12:23", "would imagine it would be simple for", "12:26", "them to do that you're entering into", "12:27", "prison they just vaccinate you just I", "12:29", "couldn't come to an answer I was I was", "12:31", "searching for that the other now trying", "12:32", "to figure that out but I think that's", "12:34", "also a really good I mean there's a ton", "12:36", "of theories right right I mean it's just", "12:38", "you could go on and on and on but the", "12:41", "whole the thing that I just think that I", "12:44", "would like to see more research and I'm", "12:45", "just hoping you know that that CDC and", "12:48", "other people are investigating these", "12:49", "these other the cross and unity right", "12:51", "like if there's if there's antibodies", "12:54", "that you're making against another", "12:55", "coronavirus beta corona virus is in the", "12:58", "same family as this sarge one no one's", "12:59", "had sarge one in the united states you", "13:01", "know so like that one doesn't that", "13:03", "that's not as relevant as but the common", "13:05", "cold you know that's that's very common", "13:07", "right so you know if if fifteen to", "13:10", "thirty percent of the common cold is", "13:12", "composed of corona viruses we know at", "13:14", "least two of those corona virus sir are", "13:17", "in the same family that have been", "13:18", "identified to make at least in one case", "13:21", "there's", "13:21", "neutralizing antibodies so their husband", "13:23", "cross immunity then you'd think why why", "13:26", "not test that that cuz get some animal", "13:27", "studies started on that you know peaking", "13:29", "of animal studies there was an article", "13:31", "that I was reading yesterday that was", "13:32", "saying that they're they're hoping that", "13:34", "they've found some antibodies in llamas", "13:37", "that they're hoping they're going to be", "13:40", "able to because of see we could find", "13:42", "this because of these antibodies in", "13:46", "llamas they they they're hoping they can", "13:48", "either transfer them to people or learn", "13:50", "something about how these antibodies are", "13:52", "created but llamas seem to be a meat", "13:55", "here it is llamas could be the key to", "13:57", "fighting new coronaviruses research says", "13:59", "make that larger it says it may sound", "14:04", "bizarre animals but llamas could be the", "14:05", "key to fighting new coronavirus", "14:07", "researchers from Belgium oh my remember", "14:09", "that's the big lady that I was showing", "14:10", "you earlier", "14:11", "she's a healthful eating and the United", "14:13", "States published an article this week in", "14:15", "the journal Cell that

like", "15:46", "large-scale manufacturing them right so", "15:48", "like if you can identify these", "15:50", "antibodies and then manufacture them you", "15:52", "can inject them in people and then", "15:54", "potentially get some protection the", "15:56", "problem is is that that's not it like", "15:58", "it's just going to be a short-lived", "15:59", "protection like it's going to be it's", "16:01", "not like you can it's not like a vaccine", "16:03", "or your body's making its own antibodies", "16:05", "and they're and they're more", "16:06", "longer-lived", "16:07", "oh no but so in areas where people are", "16:10", "getting exposed perhaps you could give", "16:11", "it to them it would stop them from", "16:13", "getting but how long we say short-lived", "16:15", "we well

there's I they isolated", "17:03", "from humanized mice or something but", "17:06", "there's other companies that have", "17:07", "isolated them from humans that have been", "17:08", "affected so you know that's that's", "17:11", "definitely a promising area for sure and", "17:15", "the good thing about that is that have", "17:18", "you heard of antibody dependent", "17:19", "enhancement do you know so that's a big", "17:22", "concern all right so so basically when", "17:26", "you when your body is exposed to a", "17:28", "pathogen like a virus your your innate", "17:30", "immune system you know the first line of", "17:32", "defense like neutrophils things like", "17:34", "that are making hydrogen peroxide trying", "17:35", "to kill the virus but then in the", "17:37", "background your adaptive immune system", "17:39", "and I'm just totally generalizing it's", "17:41", "you know is is also working in the", "17:43", "background and you know part of that an", "17:46", "adaptive immune response is", "17:48", "you know to produce antibodies so you", "17:50", "have memory B cells that are making", "17:51", "antibodies that are specific to bind", "17:53", "different regions epitopes on the virus", "17:55", "and neutralize them prevent them from", "17:57", "getting inside of the cell and so that", "18:01", "adaptive immune system usually takes", "18:03", "about seven days after you're exposed to", "18:05", "the virus right", "18:07", "the problem is antibody dependent", "18:10", "enhancement so sometimes a neutralizing", "18:13", "antibody is an antibody that can bind to", "18:15", "the virus and neutralize it stop it from", "18:17", "entering yourself right so you're it's", "18:19", "doing its job but you sometimes make", "18:21", "antibodies that are non neutralizing or", "18:23", "don't do as good of a job they don't", "18:25", "bind as tight or something and then you", "18:29", "can have what's called antibody", "18:31", "dependent enhancement and this was like", "18:32", "a big problem for the RSV vaccine back", "18:36", "in the you know like most kids get RSV", "18:39", "it's a respiratory tract infection the", "18:40", "most kids get it by the time they're two", "18:42", "like and there's no vaccine that that", "18:45", "are that's given back in the sixties", "18:47", "there was this antibody dependent", "18:50", "enhancement happened in some clinical", "18:52", "studies with toddlers and some fathers", "18:54", "got really really sick and a couple died", "18:56", "but what happens is basically the", "18:58", "antibody binds so that there's a couple", "19:00", "of things the antibody binds to the", "19:01", "virus and can basically change its", "19:03", "conformation and allow the virus to get", "19:05", "into the cell better so then you become", "19:07", "like you know you get like a higher", "19:09", "viral load and then you don't have", "19:10", "antibodies to neutralize it and it just", "19:12", "you know it could be more it could be it", "19:14", "could lead to death the other thing that", "19:16", "happens is the antibody binds the virus", "19:17", "doesn't neutralize it but it like makes", "19:19", "this crazy immune complex that like", "19:21", "activates your immune system to just go", "19:23", "haywire and it causes all sorts of", "19:24", "pathology and that's what happened with", "19:26", "the RSV

and I think marriage as", "19:38", "well where so this is also a problem", "19:42", "with vaccines so like people like giving", "19:45", "giving the vaccine people's immune", "19:46", "response some people can have that", "19:48", "antibody dependent hansman and that's", "19:50", "what was shown to happen with these with", "19:52", "this article one there was some", "19:53", "non-human primate studies that that did", "19:55", "that and also animal studies as well so", "20:00", "you know menthe", "20:02", "the thing with monoclonal antibodies is", "20:03", "they're a little more specific because", "20:04", "you know they neutralize and you're like", "20:06", "growing them up like you've done all", "20:08", "that test as opposed to just letting", "20:09", "your immune system do its thing and then", "20:11", "potentially you know you may have this", "20:14", "like non neutralizing antibody that", "20:16", "could cause problems but that's kind of", "20:19", "the concern and I know that the vaccine", "20:21", "people that are working in vaccines are", "20:22", "working on them it's like they're", "20:23", "concerned I mean about that and", "20:25", "completely trying to like figure that", "20:26", "all out it's such a strange virus it", "20:29", "almost seems like there's multiple", "20:31", "viruses there are yeah so I mean there's", "20:34", "and it's funny that because it's kind of", "20:36", "connected to this antibody dependent", "20:37", "enhancement there's there's been quite a", "20:39", "few different like forms like mutations", "20:42", "that have been identified but too", "20:44", "particular in that spike protein region", "20:46", "that's like an important region because", "20:48", "antibodies bind there and because that's", "20:50", "the region like that you know the virus", "20:52", "uses to get into the cell and so there's", "20:57", "been there's been two major like strains", "21:01", "that have been identified and one of", "21:03", "them so it's in a spinning spike region", "21:05", "and it's a aspartate to glide glycine", "21:06", "mutation and basically in in asia and", "21:10", "china the the predominant form is the", "21:13", "the aspartate the like original", "21:15", "quote-unquote form and then in Europe", "21:18", "and also in North America this other", "21:20", "this other form the glycine mutant is", "21:22", "prominent and there's been studies that", "21:24", "have shown looking at like okay looking", "21:28", "in parts of Europe different countries", "21:30", "in Europe that have this predominant", "21:32", "form that they're basically there's a", "21:35", "higher mortality rate but they didn't", "21:36", "actually measure infected patients so", "21:38", "you know it's kind of like correlation", "21:39", "but what's interesting is that there's", "21:42", "there's actually been a genetic link to", "21:44", "this meet this mutant so there's studies", "21:47", "there's been some large-scale genetics", "21:48", "genetic studies that have found that", "21:50", "Asians about 20% of Asians have", "21:53", "basically a nucleotide change in a gene", "21:57", "that encodes for a protein that's", "22:00", "involved in this you know basically in", "22:02", "allowing this virus to get into the cell", "22:03", "but that basically prevents them from", "22:06", "having this mutant that's predominant in", "22:08", "Europe and also in New York and in North", "22:11", "America in general that's a shame", "22:13", "because my friend Michael who got it is", "22:15", "mom who got it who's in her 70s is Asian", "22:18", "and that is she kicked it in a day that", "22:21", "is interesting so there's something so", "22:24", "they're there wonder if she has that", "22:25", "snip so we we wear our genetic report", "22:28", "that we have like we've got one that's", "22:30", "like a new viral report it's a free one", "22:32", "where we're kind of like putting some of", "22:34", "these interesting snips which don't mean", "22:35", "anything I mean like you know it's just", "22:36", "information that you know is interesting", "22:38", "there's a lot of researchers out there", "22:39", "trying to like figure out if genetics is", "22:42", "involved in this but the thing that's so", "22:43", "interesting about that mutation is that", "22:46", "the it's in that spike region and it's", "22:48", "where the antibody binds and peep and", "22:50", "there's a there's like a theory going", "22:52", "around because that specific region it's", "22:54", "been shown in SARS Cove one to cause", "22:56", "antibody dependent enhancement so", "22:58", "there's a theory that potentially that", "23:00", "mutation is causing people's immune", "23:02", "system to hyper activate and basically", "23:05", "become more active and it can be lead to", "23:07", "a morges severe Koba 19 illness that's", "23:10", "not been shown like it's not been shown", "23:12", "at all so but it's interesting right", "23:14", "it's interesting how in Asia and China", "23:17", "particularly I mean about 1% of the", "23:19", "population it's like less than 1% has", "23:21", "the other mutation meet the glycine", "23:23", "mutation that's in New York it's in you", "23:25", "know in most of the United States but", "23:27", "that that in less than 1% of the", "23:31", "population in China has that form so", "23:33", "weird and Japan has a very low mortality", "23:36", "rate correct yeah they do I know that", "23:40", "that that I was mentioning that TB", "23:41", "vaccine that's one thing that they're", "23:43", "investigating I mean there's all sorts", "23:45", "of differences in handling the whole you", "23:48", "know from the beginning just how you how", "23:50", "you handle it my resume I'd like there's", "23:52", "there's too many factors to like say one", "23:54", "thing but you know there's there's lots", "23:57", "of there's lots of possibilities and I", "24:00", "think that that I think that eventually", "24:02", "there's going to be therapeutics that", "24:03", "are identified you know you not make", "24:06", "multiple ones maybe and I think vitamin", "24:09", "D is going to potentially play a role", "24:10", "there but I mean just like things like", "24:13", "REM disappear and you know monoclonal", "24:15", "antibodies and then you eventually like", "24:18", "you know a vaccine will you know", "24:21", "eventually you know be be available but", "24:25", "I think until that till that point I do", "24:27", "think that things will be identified", "24:28", "that", "24:28", "just kind of help us like deal with this", "24:31", "like better you know what is the going", "24:33", "on with blood types one of the things we", "24:36", "talked about earlier you asked my blood", "24:37", "type and I said Oh positive now why is", "24:40", "o+ better well there's there's been some", "24:47", "data and this was also with identified", "24:49", "with SARS code one that people with type", "24:52", "O blood they they make antibodies they", "24:56", "make type a antibodies whereas people", "24:59", "with type A blood they make antibodies", "25:03", "against like they make against the B", "25:05", "antigen and so the type eight antibodies", "25:08", "were identified so there's been studies", "25:10", "looking at people with type O blood or", "25:12", "type type A blood and also type B and", "25:16", "type O blood there's like less less", "25:19", "frequency of getting Cobra 19 so as", "25:23", "opposed to having a severe form it's", "25:24", "just like you're less likely to contract", "25:26", "it even and it's thought because the", "25:29", "type a antibodies that people with type", "25:30", "O blood make neutralize the they", "25:34", "basically bind to that region that spike", "25:36", "region and neutralizing antibody and", "25:37", "prevent it from the virus from entering", "25:39", "the cell so that's at least that was the", "25:42", "mechanism that was shown with Sarge Club", "25:44", "one so it's thought oh well the same", "25:46", "we're seeing the same you know pattern", "25:49", "where people with Type O are protected", "25:51", "from Sarge Cove to possibly that's", "25:53", "that's also why but another really", "25:56", "interesting thing is that people with", "25:58", "type O blood", "25:59", "we were also talking about these like", "26:01", "blood clots and like I mean there's all", "26:04", "kinds of crazy things you read I mean", "26:06", "I'm reading all these publications it's", "26:07", "just and then the other thing is all", "26:08", "these publications are being uploaded on", "26:10", "you know before they're peer reviewed", "26:11", "and I mean some of them are just a mess", "26:14", "and it's just anyways but you know you", "26:16", "kind of just take it with the grain salt", "26:19", "where these clots are like you know", "26:21", "there's clots and people that are", "26:23", "healthy and young certainly people that", "26:25", "have severe cases people like older", "26:26", "people people that are pre-existing", "26:30", "conditions and stuff and the type O", "26:33", "blood people have lower levels of this", "26:36", "von Willebrand factor which basically is", "26:39", "involved in clotting and it's been shown", "26:41", "that that von Willebrand", "26:42", "factor also is involved like as higher", "26:45", "it's higher in people with carts our", "26:48", "cove - it was shown also be that Viserys", "26:50", "Cove one and it's involved with clotting", "26:52", "so having lower levels may somehow even", "26:54", "help protect against that's a theory it", "26:58", "hasn't been shown but what is known is", "27:01", "that people with type O blood are less", "27:03", "susceptible to contracting cobra 19", "27:06", "that's that's definitely known but I", "27:10", "mean I think there's so many things", "27:12", "there's just there's so many factors", "27:14", "that a lot of data that needs to be", "27:16", "parsed out right for sure I mean a lot", "27:18", "of data that needs parse out a lot of", "27:20", "data that needs to be generated and and", "27:22", "you know we need higher quality data we", "27:26", "need you know you know people to repeat", "27:30", "stuff you mean like look what's happened", "27:31", "with this hydroxychloroquine stuff right", "27:33", "I mean I mean it's just kind of a mess", "27:35", "where initially it seemed like it could", "27:38", "be helpful and and then just more and", "27:40", "more studies came out where it was not", "27:42", "not only not helpful it was you know", "27:44", "toxic it was causing people to have", "27:47", "dangerous arrhythmias and stuff um you", "27:50", "know so that's that's kind of the the", "27:52", "reason to kind of be cautious when when", "27:54", "you have something new and a small and", "27:55", "one small study this seems like in the", "27:58", "beginning at least they're trying to", "28:00", "figure out what the correct treatment", "28:01", "was for these people as they were just", "28:03", "showing up in mass in the emergency", "28:06", "rooms and they didn't really know and", "28:08", "doctors they varied in how they", "28:10", "approached it my friend Michael his", "28:12", "doctor didn't put him on a ventilator", "28:13", "and he said if I put him on a ventilator", "28:15", "he's probably going to die right because", "28:17", "he said his body's gonna stop working", "28:19", "because it's it's gonna let the", "28:21", "ventilator do the breathing for him and", "28:23", "it's gonna give up and what he was", "28:25", "talking about after the fact what", "28:28", "Michael was talking about was how that", "28:30", "is proven to be correct in New York and", "28:32", "that some monstrous number like 80% of", "28:35", "the put on no leaders wound up done not", "28:37", "just New York I like I've had friends", "28:39", "that are physicians that of like you", "28:41", "know in New Orleans I mean the same", "28:43", "thing where it's like a you know I there", "28:47", "was someone on my team we were looking", "28:48", "we were doing some research on this and", "28:49", "I and I didn't sort of dive into the", "28:51", "whole thing but he was he was telling me", "28:53", "that", "28:54", "ventilators do actually like cause more", "28:57", "damage to the lungs and like like he'd", "28:59", "been reading some studies to like", "29:00", "confirm that and he was pretty certain", "29:02", "that that ventilators actually cause", "29:05", "damage and actually could like induce", "29:07", "damage where it's like making it worse", "29:09", "so that's so bad I don't know I don't", "29:12", "know all the specifics so that all I", "29:13", "know is that it looking at the", "29:16", "statistics like if you go on a", "29:17", "ventilator I mean surely it seems like", "29:18", "the outcomes not very it doesn't seem", "29:21", "like it's gonna be very good right now", "29:23", "it's hard to say is that the cause of it", "29:25", "or is it right you know just that", "29:27", "they're so fucked up by the time they", "29:29", "get on a ventilator they just wind up", "29:31", "dying right well here at like the the", "29:33", "there's been some really interesting", "29:35", "data looking at like in there so in the", "29:37", "Philippines and Indonesia where else", "29:43", "didn't or I think New Orleans as well", "29:44", "they've looked at patients that have", "29:47", "died and their vitamin D levels and been", "29:50", "bitten basically like in the Philippines", "29:52", "you know people that for like every", "29:54", "standard deviation increase in vitamin D", "29:56", "levels serum vitamin D levels", "29:58", "you know the people had like an 8% or", "30:02", "were eight fold eight times less likely", "30:04", "to have a severe form of Koba 19 and if", "30:06", "they had and they were 20 times less", "30:08", "likely to have critical like critic", "30:11", "critical form of Koba 19 whoa", "30:14", "in the so that was the Philippines in", "30:16", "the Indonesia I was a really interesting", "30:18", "study where like they measured vitamin D", "30:20", "and this was measured in the patients", "30:22", "there's been some vitamin D studies also", "30:23", "where they're like looking at you know", "30:25", "countries that have been affected the", "30:27", "worst and they all like have low vitamin", "30:29", "D and it's like okay well anyways that's", "30:30", "correlation but well so is this but a", "30:34", "little it's a little stronger data the", "30:36", "in the in Indonesia patients that died", "30:40", "90 i but almost 100% it was like 98", "30:43", "point something percent of patients that", "30:45", "died with Koba 19 were vitamin D", "30:48", "deficient four percent of patients that", "30:51", "died from Koba 19 were vitamin D so fish", "30:54", "are say four percent only four percent", "30:57", "were five item Indies sufficient so", "31:00", "basically they were all vitamin D", "31:01", "deficient all the ones that are dying", "31:02", "whoa", "31:03", "crazy right and New Orleans had some", "31:05", "crazy crazy be the mechanism that", "31:07", "cause so I think there's all right can", "31:10", "we cut can we get into vitamin C please", "31:12", "do it's a big I really because of you I", "31:14", "take 5,000 IU's a day awesome right now", "31:19", "I'm taking 5,000 IU's a day mm-hmm", "31:21", "you know 70% of the US population has", "31:24", "insufficient vitamin D levels which is", "31:26", "considered less than blood levels less", "31:28", "than 30 milligrams nanograms per", "31:31", "milliliter is something your body can", "31:33", "generate naturally if you're exposed to", "31:35", "Sun on a daily basis yes that's the best", "31:37", "way to get it it is but the problem is", "31:40", "is that we don't go outside anymore", "31:43", "and usually no yeah exactly", "31:46", "yeah now more than ever but even", "31:48", "terrible recipe right vitamin D", "31:51", "deficiency is what makes it worse and", "31:53", "then you're staying inside so you're not", "31:54", "getting any vitamin D yeah you're", "31:56", "becoming even more deficient you know", "31:58", "like like someone like 28% of the u.s.", "32:01", "population is actually deficient like", "32:02", "less than 20 nanograms from mil you know", "32:05", "like that's defined deficiency so", "32:07", "there's a lot of people in the United", "32:08", "States as you mentioned you make it from", "32:10", "the Sun so particularly UVB radiation", "32:13", "there's a reason why I want to talk", "32:14", "about this you make it from UVB", "32:17", "radiation exposure you know basically", "32:18", "you're it's made in the skin and but you", "32:22", "know there's certain times of the year", "32:23", "depending on where you live in a more", "32:24", "north and latitude where that UVB isn't", "32:26", "even hitting the atmosphere so you're", "32:28", "not making vitamin D also if you have", "32:30", "darker skin melanin protects you like", "32:33", "the whole you know people with darker", "32:34", "skin people from maybe Africa or India", "32:37", "or South Asia they're more equatorial", "32:40", "regions they're closer you know closer", "32:42", "to the equator and there's more UVB", "32:45", "radiation throughout the year and so as", "32:48", "a protective mechanism to not get burned", "32:51", "you have melanin which protects you", "32:53", "right the problem is is that melanin", "32:55", "also blocks your your ability to produce", "32:58", "vitamin D but if you're out in the Sun", "33:00", "all the time you know in a place where", "33:02", "you're getting UVB radiation it's not a", "33:04", "problem well this is the very reason why", "33:06", "people in places like Scotland and", "33:08", "England have such pale skin exactly", "33:11", "cloudy all the time so your body sort of", "33:13", "develops its own ability to absorb more", "33:15", "vitamin exactly so what happens when you", "33:17", "take some what what happens when you", "33:19", "take a person from from", "33:21", "South Asia from India from Africa and", "33:24", "you put them in Sweden or in Minnesota", "33:26", "or in the UK a place where UVB radiation", "33:31", "doesn't hit most of the year and you", "33:33", "don't give them a supplement what", "33:34", "happens is they become severely vitamin", "33:36", "D deficient severely and what happens", "33:39", "when you take I mean I mean you can", "33:40", "throw this on the you can flip flip this", "33:42", "over and say okay what happens when you", "33:43", "take the guy from the UK the Brit and", "33:45", "put them in Australia like without any",

happening in the", "38:05", "vitamin D deficient what is happening in", "38:07", "the body that's causing their immune", "38:09", "system this this hormone deficiency not", "38:11", "having this vitamin D whether it's", "38:13", "through some exposure so there's lots of", "38:15", "things I mean it plays a vital into your", "38:17", "receptors on like your immune cells and", "38:19", "and the reason for that is because one", "38:21", "of the hormone vitamin D hormone binds", "38:23", "to the receptor it activates all these", "38:25", "genes and that the genes do stuff that", "38:28", "are you know regulate immune function", "38:29", "you know there's there studies that have", "38:31", "shown people and I love these studies", "38:34", "because because they basically take away", "38:37",

"38:50", "though those confounding factors are", "38:53", "usually corrected for it sold at the end", "38:55", "of day it's an association right and", "38:57", "everyone's like correlations on", "38:59", "causation which is true but sometimes", "39:01", "you got to like look at the full body of", "39:03", "data you know there are genetic", "39:05", "polymorphisms so so there are people",

person", "39:16", "that's that has a genetically like it's", "39:19", "they're genetically low vitamin D so", "39:21", "you're not categorizing them based on", "39:22", "their vitamin D levels", "39:23", "you're categorizing them based on their", "39:25", "gene and those people are more likely to", "39:27", "die from respiratory infections just", "39:30", "based on that gene alone so yeah at that", "39:33", "gene that it's known to lower it lowers", "39:35", "vitam it leads to lower vitamin D levels", "39:37", "and so like those people are more likely", "39:39", "to die from respiratory infections than", "39:41", "people that don't have that which it's a", "39:43", "great way of kind of randomizing people", "39:44", "by their genes as opposed to doing a", "39:47", "randomized control

doses either weekly or daily", "39:57", "monthly didn't work", "39:59", "they're the people with low baseline", "40:02", "vitamin D levels so people that were", "40:04", "like deficient they were 50% less likely", "40:07", "to have a respiratory tract infection if", "40:08", "they were taking the vitamin D", "40:10", "supplement over fifty percent actually", "40:12", "and people that had already normal", "40:14", "levels still had a protective effect", "40:15", "there was a little 10% less likely so", "40:17", "even people that were already considered", "40:19", "normal taking about vitamin D supplement", "40:22", "helped prevent the respiratory tract can", "40:24", "you take too much vitamin D yes", "40:26", "you can you can it's too much so right", "40:29", "so the the upper the tolerable upper", "40:30", "intake has been set by the nutrition", "40:33", "board the Institute of Medicine to be", "40:34", "4,000 IU's a day but there's been", "40:38", "studies that have shown that you can I", "40:41", "mean people that have taken you know", "40:44", "10,000 IU's a day for for multiple years", "40:46", "haven't had any hypercalcemia or had you", "40:48", "know problems but too much vitamin D can", "40:53", "be toxic it's not good to take that it's", "40:56", "best to like get a vitamin D blood test", "40:58", "and I think that personally there has", "41:02", "been a trend so people that have blood", "41:04", "levels higher than 60 may have just a", "41:07", "little bit higher calcium level but not", "41:10", "much not like it's not like anything to", "41:12", "be hugely concerned about but there are", "41:14", "studies also showing that either vitamin", "41:17", "k1 so there's been a meta-analysis", "41:20", "looking at of 12 different studies or", "41:22", "think where vitamin k1 or vitamin k2", "41:24", "were given and both of those improved", "41:27", "bone mineral density and prevented any", "41:29", "hypercalcemia because when you take", "41:32", "vitamin D you absorb calcium better like", "41:34", "something crazy like 40% more dietary", "41:36", "calcium being absorbed Wow so so the", "41:39", "problem is is that calcium can easily", "41:43", "form a precipitate in in in general and", "41:46", "particularly when phosphorus is around", "41:48", "and phosphorus is another thing vitamin", "41:50", "D does increase the absorption of but", "41:53", "again like I said that you know it's", "41:55", "really like it's really hard to find any", "41:57", "studies where vitamin D is causing you", "41:59", "know hypercalcemia unless it's like", "42:01", "really really high dose for for a while", "42:04", "I personally think taking the the", "42:07", "vitamin K and what's interesting about", "42:08", "the vitamin k1 versus vitamin k2 with", "42:11", "without going into too much of a tangent", "42:13", "is basically the the vitamin k1 normally", "42:17", "it goes to your liver and it's involved", "42:18", "in blood coagulation but when there's", "42:20", "enough vitamin k1 around it stays in the", "42:22", "periphery and it moves calcium periphery", "42:25", "being blood stream it moves calcium out", "42:26", "of the bloodstream and takes it to", "42:27", "places where it's supposed to go like", "42:29", "the bones and the muscle vitamin k2", "42:32", "usually stays around the periphery that", "42:33", "doesn't really go to the liver so it", "42:35", "usually that's really what it's just", "42:36", "doing is you know moving calcium out and", "42:38", "bringing it to the bones and so I take a", "42:40", "I actually have k1 in my multi that I", "42:42", "take but I also take a k2 supplement mk4", "42:45", "I take it like a couple times a week", "42:48", "well the ke ones in my multi so I don't", "42:50", "bite Amin k1 is really it's found in", "42:53", "dark leafy greens so I get a lot of", "42:55", "those as well a lot so I'm getting a lot", "42:58", "of k1 vitamin k2 is not as it's not as", "43:02", "readily found in like the Western I mean", "43:05", "it's like the food that's highest in it", "43:06", "is that fermented swiping natto mm-hmm", "43:09", "but it's like a small quantities and", "43:11", "like do you ever get concerned from the", "43:13", "high volume of leafy greens you ever get", "43:15", "conservative oxalates or getting kidney", "43:18", "stones or anything along those lines no", "43:20", "I like the few studies that I've seen", "43:22", "it's and people that are like doing", "43:24", "insane juicing and they're already like", "43:27", "messed up you know so I'm not concerned", "43:30", "at all like even like the oxalate so", "43:33", "oxalates actually I don't want to go", "43:35", "into this but so ya know I don't", "43:36", "consider I want the vitamin D thing is", "43:38", "so important I mean like the the the", "43:42", "reason there's a big reason I think that", "43:44", "vitamin D is so important it's for the", "43:47", "lung function and the respiratory", "43:48", "function but what's really interesting", "43:50", "is that you know the the very receptor", "43:54", "that this Sarcos cofee virus binds to to", "43:57", "gain entry into the cell it's called a", "43:59", "stew that very receptor plays a really", "44:03", "important role in preventing lung damage", "44:07", "and and basically in preventing acute", "44:10", "lung injury preventing acute respiratory", "44:11", "distress syndrome ARDS and what's been", "44:14", "shown with SARS Kove one is that", "44:17", "kasarkode one also binds to that", "44:18", "receptor ace 2 it's called and that's", "44:20", "how it gets into the cell just like the", "44:22", "SARS cough - when when it binds to the", "44:24", "receptor it like", "44:26", "attach\u00e9s and like through this like", "44:27", "weird endocytosis mechanism it takes the", "44:30", "receptor in and decreases the receptor", "44:33", "what's called down regulates down", "44:34", "regulates the receptor so you end up", "44:35", "having less ace 2 which causes like can", "44:39", "cause severe lung injury not having the", "44:41", "ACE 2 it plays a big role in protecting", "44:43", "that's been shown in multiple studies", "44:44", "like so the Sarge Cove one virus does", "44:47", "that it's thought the Sarge coped who", "44:48", "also does it because it goes through the", "44:49", "same entries through the same receptor", "44:51", "and it's been shown that like if you for", "44:54", "example if you give mice", "44:58", "lipopolysaccharide or something that's", "44:59", "going to cause lung injury and then you", "45:02", "give them vitamin D so the lung injury", "45:04", "itself also causes the h2 receptor to", "45:06", "decrease and it so it's like this", "45:08", "vicious cycle of like making the damage", "45:10", "worse but if you give my vitamin D", "45:13", "before that happens the h2 receptor", "45:15", "increases and it protects them from the", "45:17", "lung injury but you give the vitamin D", "45:20", "to control mice that don't have the lung", "45:21", "injury it doesn't do anything to the ACE", "45:23", "to receptor levels so it's not like full", "45:26", "stop it's not like you know drugs the", "45:28", "way drugs are designed is they like they", "45:30", "target a certain molecule and they bum", "45:32", "they like do their thing and they either", "45:34", "increase it or decrease it a lot of", "45:36", "times with like hormones you know", "45:38", "vitamins things like that there they", "45:40", "they maintain homeostasis you know what", "45:43", "I mean does like so when when shit goes", "45:45", "wrong they fix it they're not just like", "45:47", "boom full stop gonna like increase", "45:50", "something when everything's normal", "45:51", "so and that's important because there", "45:54", "have been some concern about taking", "45:56", "vitamin D increasing the ACE 2 receptor", "45:58", "and there's another study that was with", "46:00", "hypertensive rats where the hypertension", "46:02", "caused ace 2 to go down and that like", "46:04", "makes lung and it makes all sorts of", "46:06", "problems it also causes like kidney", "46:07", "problems and all sorts of things right", "46:08", "but but the vitamin d increased the ACE", "46:12", "2 but only in the hypertensive rats not", "46:14", "in the normal control rats again so you", "46:17", "know and then there was another study", "46:19", "that was like some other messed up", "46:20", "diabetic animal model where the vitamin", "46:24", "D actually didn't increase the ACE 2", "46:26", "receptor but it increased what's called", "46:28", "soluble ace 2 which is in like it's in", "46:30", "the periphery and that actually", "46:32", "potentially could bind Tsarskoe to virus", "46:35", "and prevent it from it's like", "46:36", "sequestering it preventing it from", "46:37", "entering the cell that's actually being", "46:39", "explored as a potential", "46:40", "therapeutic so but the bottom line here", "46:43", "is that sometimes you'll hear this h2", "46:46", "receptor and that's how the virus gets", "46:48", "in and is like I don't want that I don't", "46:50", "want I want less of that because that's", "46:51", "how the virus gets in but like like", "46:53", "biology is always way more complicated", "46:56", "than just a simple taking it out of a", "46:59", "big picture right you know so like the", "47:01", "h2 receptor the h2 is part of the rena", "47:04", "in angiotensin system it plays a huge", "47:06", "role in inflammation it's also like when", "47:08", "you when you decrease ace - all these", "47:11", "signaling cascades happen and it's like", "47:13", "a stew is important for producing", "47:15", "pro-inflammatory cytokines at the end of", "47:17", "the day without getting into all the", "47:18", "stuff you know specifics so it causes", "47:21", "massive inflammation to have a decrease", "47:23", "it basically causes acute lung injury it", "47:26", "exacerbates it I mean it's crazy so I", "47:30", "really I just I really can you imagine", "47:33", "if vitamin D really did help like if", "47:35", "there was something that could be given", "47:37", "along with the other stuff from desi", "47:39", "beer or whatever whatever it's going to", "47:40", "be the stuff that we identify but like", "47:42", "vitamin D so is so cheap it's so easy", "47:45", "and so many people are deficient and", "47:49", "insufficient you know like so yes as you", "47:52", "mentioned there is you know you don't", "47:53", "want to take too much vitamin D you", "47:55", "don't want to like you know overdose on", "47:56", "it but I think in the short term you", "48:00", "know particularly like in the short term", "48:02", "and particularly in patients people that", "48:04", "have already been infected you know it", "48:06", "may be why is to to try giving your", "48:09", "patient like if you're a physician you", "48:12", "know dealing with this may be may be", "48:14", "wise to try and didn't see their vitamin", "48:16", "D levels and perhaps give them some you", "48:18", "know is this being explored public means", "48:20", "just something that people are talking", "48:22", "about publicly because I all I'm hearing", "48:24", "is drugs and possible drug remedies", "48:27", "potential vaccine that they're working", "48:29", "on

"48:38", "now", "48:38", "yeah let's definitely talk more there", "48:40", "are yes it is so there are clinical", "48:43", "studies unfortunately not a ton of them", "48:45", "in the United States that are looking", "48:47", "randomised control trials looking at", "48:49", "vitamin D the effects of vitamin D on", "48:51", "already you know patients with Coppa 19", "48:54", "which what would be

"66:01", "gets credit like he is really really", "66:05", "involved in putting that out there like", "66:08", "the difference between intravenous", "66:09", "vitamin C and oral or apples and oranges", "66:12", "completely different like and so until", "66:14", "that was known I guess maybe the Mayo", "66:16", "Clinic that just thought oh vitamin C's", "66:18", "vitamin C you just can take it earlier", "66:20", "and until like some of that data started", "66:23", "coming out the pharmacokinetic data", "66:24", "where it was like no it's not the same", "66:26", "thing like you're talking about seventy", "66:28", "times higher vitamin C levels in the", "66:30", "plasma like you could never do that from", "66:32", "oral like it's not the same at all", "66:35", "before that was known I guess maybe that", "66:37", "that's why", "66:39", "I heard people dismiss vitamin C saying", "66:41", "that your body only absorbs a certain", "66:42", "amount it's wasted if you take more than", "66:44", "that you do so here's the thing like so", "66:47", "so maximum bioavailability does occur at", "66:49", "200 milligrams and once you go above", "66:51", "that like when you switch if you take", "66:52", "500 milligrams of vitamin C orally you", "66:55", "start to excrete a lot in urine", "66:57", "but that doesn't if you look at the", "66:59", "plasma levels you're still increasing", "67:01", "them much higher your excreting more -", "67:04", "but you're you're increasing your plasma", "67:06", "levels more so you take 200 milligrams", "67:08", "you get your plasma levels of vitamin C", "67:10", "up to 90 you take 500 you may get it a", "67:13", "little bit more you take 3 grams you get", "67:15", "it to 220 yeah you're gonna be peeing a", "67:16", "lot out but you got to 220 right and so", "67:19", "if you look at these these common cold", "67:21", "studies there's like randomized", "67:22", "meta-analysis randomized controlled", "67:24", "trials and analysis about they've shown", "67:25", "that like you know 2 grams is better", "67:28", "than 1 gram for like reducing the", "67:32", "duration of the common cold two grams", "67:34", "better than 1 and children are more have", "67:37", "a more robust effect than adults so like", "67:39", "adults like it reduces the common cold", "67:41", "like 2 grams can do something like 20%", "67:44", "reduced a duration about like 20% or", "67:46", "something and that's children alike", "67:47", "emergency that company got a lot of shit", "67:49", "for their claims and there's grants I", "67:53", "said two grams emergency doesn't have", "67:54", "right so so then there you go so you", "67:58", "keep looking down there's more", "67:59", "meta-analysis another meta-analysis that", "68:01", "looked at 200 milligrams up to like 200", "68:05", "milligrams up to 2 grams and that study", "68:07", "kind of just lumped everything together", "68:09", "rather than the other study like ok what", "68:11", "happens is 2 grams and 1 and they did", "68:13", "all these sub analysis and that was", "68:14", "great because they like got to the", "68:15", "bottom of it dose matters the other", "68:18", "study it was like oh it reduces the", "68:21", "duration by like 4% you know basically", "68:23", "nothing so so there's like all this", "68:25", "there was all these conclusions it", "68:26", "doesn't do anything well yeah 200", "68:29", "milligrams look at that graph it does it", "68:30", "doesn't shit to your plasma levels like", "68:32", "you're still at baseline so I think that", "68:35", "people designing clinical studies like", "68:37", "they need like that needs to be in their", "68:39", "mind before they design their trial ok", "68:42", "what am I trying to measure here like I", "68:44", "want to get I need to like I need a", "68:46", "measurable like I need something to", "68:48", "measure and you got to change right to", "68:50", "get an outcome like if you want you're", "68:51", "trying to like see what", "68:52", "affect vitamin C has on whatever outcome", "68:55", "you're gonna want to wait ray someone's", "68:57", "plasma levels right so I guess it's good", "68:59", "at the end of the day to know that 200", "69:01", "milligrams doesn't do anything because", "69:02", "then you go okay well 200 milligrams", "69:04", "doesn't do anything but it's also good", "69:06", "to know that oh wait", "69:07", "if I take a higher dose there is an", "69:09", "effect so you know making this general", "69:11", "statement that Oh vitamin C", "69:13", "supplementation doesn't do anything is", "69:15", "not necessary specs yeah 200 milligrams", "69:19", "it doesn't do much for the common cold", "69:20", "but when you take 2 grams it can help", "69:23", "and also other studies have shown that", "69:24", "prophylactically slightly better than", "69:27", "like therapeutic so like after the onset", "69:29", "of symptoms so if you do it like before", "69:31", "symptoms like there's a better you know", "69:33", "how come as well so I mean that's all", "69:37", "kinds of interesting so for you", "69:39", "personally if you had the option would", "69:41", "you do it once a week", "69:42", "IV I'm it's pretty interesting yeah I've", "69:46", "like I was doing it I was actually doing", "69:48", "it once a week before enough once a", "69:51", "weeks enough totally I bet I don't even", "69:54", "know if it's necessary honestly wanted", "69:56", "to be honest because again it's a", "69:57", "therapeutic you know treatment I will", "69:59", "say this like my one of my friends she's", "70:01", "a she's an MD and she has reactive", "70:03", "Airways there's interesting studies that", "70:05", "have shown you know like that the", "70:07", "intravenous vitamin C is like", "70:09", "dramatically reducing inflammation as", "70:11", "well it's doing all kinds of crazy", "70:12", "things but her cough and it was very", "70:15", "transient it only happened like while", "70:17", "the IV while the vitamin C was high in", "70:19", "her plasma she's got this crazy calm and", "70:22", "you think she'd had Kovac he's like it's", "70:24", "just like a constant nagging cough you", "70:25", "know that it completely 100% went away I", "70:28", "noticed it and she like my friend is a", "70:31", "little bit you know she's a little bit", "70:33", "of a skeptic when it comes to the like", "70:36", "vitamins or anything like that you know", "70:38", "so I wasn't going to say anything cuz", "70:40", "her and I have gone and so on so many", "70:41", "debates about it so but she said", "70:44", "something and I was just like you know", "70:47", "I'm so glad and so she now she's wanting", "70:49", "to do it like she wanted to do it like", "70:51", "you know once a month at least", "70:53", "so mmm I thought that was you know", "70:55", "interesting you know again I don't know", "70:58", "that the intravenous vitamin C is", "70:59", "necessary there's also interesting", "71:01", "effects on like fat oxidation like it", "71:04", "affects fat oxidation because it's", "71:06", "important", "71:06", "for carnitine which isn't necessary for", "71:10",

really", "71:33", "you know important for immune function", "71:36", "as well and elderly people are more zinc", "71:39", "deficiencies not really common in the", "71:40", "u.s. most you know zinc is

getting", "71:50", "enough seen what about vegetarians", "71:51", "vegetarians do they they are more prone", "71:54", "to a zinc deficiency and in fact because", "71:58", "the zinc is bound to phytate it's less", "72:01", "bioavailable and they need to like eat", "72:02", "like up to three times more their RDA", "72:05", "needs to be like almost three times as", "72:07", "high for them or they can just", "72:08", "supplement which I know a lot of", "72:10", "vegetarians do but yeah but zinc seems", "72:12", "really important for immune function", "72:13", "like there's been studies where they've", "72:15", "like depleted healthy people of their", "72:17", "Zayn just transiently and like t-cell", "72:20", "function like is all messed up so it", "72:22", "like totally messes the immune system up", "72:24", "randomized controlled trials showing", "72:26", "that zinc zinc acetate or zinc gluconate", "72:29", "like lozenges", "72:32", "they can dramatically lower the duration", "72:35", "of common cold so is a citator gluconate", "72:38", "which one's superior so there was it's", "72:40", "like it was trending that acetate was", "72:42", "better", "72:43", "trending meaning was non significant", "72:45", "although it was like 40 percent versus", "72:48", "28% I don't like I to me lowering", "72:51", "lowering the duration of the common cold", "72:53", "by 40 percent versus lowering it by 28", "72:55", "percent I guess it was non significant", "72:56", "for whatever reason so they're saying", "72:58", "it's the study concluded that they're", "73:00", "both the same but it seems as though", "73:01", "acetate may be slightly better hmm maybe", "73:04", "slightly better but you know that I am", "73:08", "taking Zipp zinc is also a positive ion", "73:10", "so you need a zinc ionophore to help it", "73:12", "get in to cells so like quarry", "73:15", "flavonoids like quercetin quercetin is", "73:17", "found in like apples onions", "73:20", "buckwheat tea is which is what I drink", "73:21", "but you can supplement with it which", "73:23", "also supplement as well it some", "73:26", "questions interesting because it's in", "73:28", "Ghana for it's also been identified to", "73:29", "have activity against Sarge Cove one", "73:34", "antiviral activity against our scope one", "73:36", "doesn't have nootropic properties as", "73:38", "well I don't know that it has I don't", "73:42", "know it might be confusing it's it's got", "73:45", "sin oolitic properties which means it", "73:47", "can it's been shown it's been identified", "73:49", "as a possible compound that can clear", "73:52", "out some senescent cells which are those", "73:56", "cells that are you know they accumulate", "73:58", "with age and they're basically like", "73:59",

"always like to think of like as", "74:09", "mentioning to Jamie that um maybe 40 to", "74:13", "next month and so yeah I'd have some", "74:14", "great nurse hey gray hairs and it's", "74:17", "funny how like you'll get one gray hair", "74:18", "and the other gray hairs like cluster", "74:21", "around that one with the clustering and", "74:23", "I always think of like because their", "74:25", "cellular senescence happens in the", "74:26", "melanocytes the you know I responsible", "74:29", "for pigment so I always think about oh", "74:30", "the senescent melania site is like", "74:33", "reading all this pro-inflammatory stuff", "74:35", "that's now accelerating the age of my", "74:37", "other nearby hair follicle melanocytes", "74:39", "causing them to anyways quercetin has", "74:42", "been identified to clear away senescence", "74:44", "cells so that's kind of cool", "74:46", "for aging fragright hairs no that's this", "74:51", "my like an analogy for people to", "74:53",

ask you about", "75:02", "vitamin D deficiency is red light", "75:04", "therapy what would that have to do with", "75:09", "vitamin D did I don't know do you know", "75:12", "about these red light machines that", "75:15", "people stand in front of yeah the photo", "75:16", "bottle photobiomodulation yeah does that", "75:19", "have any effect on vitamin D that's not", "75:22", "UVB okay it's different yeah yeah and", "75:25", "and i you know i think that that itself", "75:30", "it's an interesting field i would say", "75:32", "that", "75:33", "it's the marketing's got a little head", "75:35", "of a science for that but I do think", "75:37", "that there's there's promise", "75:39", "particularly for some treatments you", "75:43", "know there there are some claims out", "75:44", "there that are sort of being backed up", "75:47", "by very poorly done studies mm-hmm but I", "75:52", "think I think there's some promise out", "75:54", "there for it just makes you feel good", "75:55", "that's it yeah it's interesting I've", "75:58", "been doing it I tried I wanted to do it", "76:01", "before I even talked about it for a", "76:03", "month solid and I'd do it basically four", "76:06", "or five days a week and I just I don't", "76:09", "know it's hard to tell because I do so", "76:11", "much shit do you sauna yes that makes", "76:14", "you feel good every day every day I'm", "76:16", "doing it five days a week and I'm doing", "76:18", "seven days a week hundred eighty degrees", "76:19", "for 25 minutes dude I do 180 degrees for", "76:22", "25 minutes yeah unless it's if it's 190", "76:27", "or 188 then I'll do 20 but yeah I do 25", "76:31", "at 180 as well that seems to me the", "76:34", "sweet spot you know and I've been doing", "76:36", "it every single day of the quarantine", "76:38", "because I have a sauna in my house do", "76:39", "you have a sauna in your house we we do", "76:40", "well it's in our office which is like", "76:42", "just home up it's like it's like well", "76:44", "it's not you know but it's yeah just", "76:46", "right next door", "76:46", "much so we got that literally you're not", "76:50", "gonna believe it's like like three hours", "76:52", "before shelter-in-place was put in", "76:53", "California I mean I couldn't believe it", "76:57", "well we we had ours done just a few", "77:01", "months before I mean it was just I was", "77:03", "thinking like God if we didn't have this", "77:05", "in the house and you couldn't go", "77:07", "anywhere luckily we have one here so I", "77:09", "could use the one that's here but it's a", "77:11", "godsend", "77:11", "man changes everything it's a game", "77:13", "change it's a game changer and we I've", "77:15", "been doing so I haven't had a warm", "77:17", "shower since since the shelter in place", "77:20", "since I got my cell towers I do I do", "77:22", "it's amazing like I do I don't want to", "77:25", "make people feel bad look I went a long", "77:27", "time without a sauna I know what it's", "77:28", "like I was doing hot baths and we can", "77:30", "talk about that yet it is but there is", "77:33", "something about the sauna and then the", "77:36", "cold baths the cold shower sorry the", "77:37", "cold shower", "77:38", "that is just it is a game like I am so", "77:42", "much more relaxed and this is like I", "77:43", "think I've told you the story the whole", "77:45", "reason I got interested in this on", "77:46", "was because I was in graduate school", "77:48", "doing it like every day", "77:50", "and I was like this is amazing I am so", "77:53", "much less stressed I am like calmer and", "77:55", "more relaxed I'm happier yeah", "77:56", "something's happening so I was like into", "77:58", "the not even all the muscle and all the", "78:01", "cardiovascular I mean it mimics", "78:03", "cardiovascular exercise it really has a", "78:05", "big difference in my cardiovascular", "78:06", "activity it's been shown to people", "78:09", "there's a study this was I think Gary", "78:10", "Lakhan and who's a friend of mine just", "78:13", "he's like the best the leader and so no", "78:16", "research in Finland he published a study", "78:18", "where they looked at cardiorespiratory", "78:21", "fitness and cardio I think hearty other", "78:25", "cardiovascular disease risk markers in", "78:27", "people that were physically fit or",

"78:39", "like the king so like if you compare a", "78:41", "physical activity alone to sauna alone", "78:42", "physical activities the bath step", "78:44", "improving cardiovascular health sauna is", "78:46", "also good sauna and physical activity", "78:49", "together were better than the physical", "78:52", "activity alone which I was like yeah", "78:54", "that's what you want I don't remember I", "78:55", "don't your you're asking me like six", "78:59", "months ago or more but but that's what", "79:03", "you want right like you want like you're", "79:05", "like I'm already physically active I", "79:07", "mean you're like more physically active", "79:08", "than me and so but that's what you want", "79:11", "is like the combination it makes a big", "79:13", "difference once I started doing it", "79:14", "during the lockdown one of the things I", "79:16", "noticed the runs that I do the last Hill", "79:19", "is fucking brutal and I always finish on", "79:21", "this last hill but now I've been able to", "79:24", "run that last hill the last hill it's", "79:26", "like a market difference when I hit the", "79:29", "hill I'm like wow this is crazy either", "79:31", "I'm getting in better shape and I know I", "79:32", "am for sure but it's also I gotta think", "79:35", "the sauna has a big impact because it", "79:37", "feels like I'm on a drug it feels like", "79:39", "I'm on I don't know what EPO feels like", "79:40", "but I would imagine it would feel", "79:42", "something like this was the increased", "79:43", "cardiovascular benefit it's very", "79:45", "noticeable totally totally I mean", "79:47", "there's been some small studies looking", "79:49", "at you're talking about performance", "79:51", "enhancements there's been some small", "79:52", "studies showing that particularly with", "79:54", "endurance that there is a performance", "79:56", "enhancement can you think it was cycler", "79:58", "maybe it was running running", "80:00", "in cycling I've never measured your", "80:01", "heart rate during it so yes so here's", "80:03", "the thing with that like at first I was", "80:05", "like terrified to do that I said I want", "80:07", "to ruin my Apple watch you know I've", "80:08", "like ruined and like Kevin Kevin Rose", "80:11", "was like no just put your hand on I do", "80:12", "it all the time and like I like he's a", "80:14", "tech guy so I'm like all right Kevin", "80:15", "Rose tells me I can take my Apple watch", "80:17", "and the hot freakin Sun I'm gonna do it", "80:19", "right so um you know my heart rate it", "80:22", "can get up to like 120 but the thing is", "80:26", "is that there is adaptation that happens", "80:28", "so you're basically like you're you're", "80:30", "you're becoming adapted and so your", "80:32", "heart rate doesn't increase as much like", "80:34", "over time right and I'll be I'll be", "80:37", "honest I stopped wearing my watch in", "80:38", "there so I'm not measuring my heart rate", "80:40", "anymore like so you get a whoop strap", "80:41", "because the whoop strap is no problem at", "80:43", "all yeah yeah pee I'll get you one I'll", "80:48", "have one sent to you all right right", "80:49", "there one of the sponsors of the podcast", "80:51", "but I love it I would love to have", "80:52", "something to measure it without having", "80:54", "to take my watch in there because I", "80:55", "don't like sitting like it's things you", "80:57", "know", "80:57", "well the bootstrap measures it really", "80:58", "well and it'll give you like you could", "81:00", "actually mark it down as an activity and", "81:02", "I'll show you where your heart rate so", "81:04", "it's got a mountain of data it's really", "81:07", "good that's cool yeah let me also great", "81:10", "for sleep it shows you like really", "81:12", "accurate sleep it actually has a sleep", "81:15", "coach built in so it shows you like how", "81:18", "much sleep you got how much recovery", "81:20", "yeah your recoveries out and what you", "81:21", "need it'll even tell you you know hey", "81:24", "you should go to bed since you've been", "81:26", "getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning", "81:27", "you should go to bed by 10:00 tonight", "81:28", "nice had you noticed in effect so I've", "81:31", "been doing this honor every day I start", "81:33", "my days a week because I would do it", "81:37", "every day but I got to have you know", "81:39", "more time with my son but have you", "81:41", "noticed an effect on your sleep at all", "81:43", "yeah we relaxed do you need more sleep", "81:47", "though like you know like when you're", "81:48", "working out hard like you sometimes", "81:49", "require like more more sleep yeah yeah", "81:53", "boy when I do squats for

like if", "98:33", "it's at 180 but you have 10% emailed", "98:35", "humidity it's like yeah there is I don't", "98:38", "know what that formula is absolutely", "98:40", "there's a formula and in a lot of the", "98:41", "studies and coming out of Finland many", "98:44", "of the people there are using are doing", "98:46", "the the humid stones and saunas as well", "98:49", "so I mean I guess they're called finish", "98:51", "on us which means like they're using the", "98:54", "the hot water and steam it would be", "98:56", "amazing to have a sauna an outside sauna", "98:58", "that's right

cleansing toxins", "104:26", "were like fuck off I was like so put off", "104:29", "with the talks and stuff like it's funny", "104:30", "cuz the sauna like that's like the one", "104:33", "like for years like all the benefits", "104:35", "about sauna we're always about toxins", "104:36", "right right they're always with toxins", "104:39", "what are you talking about like show me", "104:41", "what you're saying when you're talking", "104:42", "about you talking about just regular", "104:43", "sweat but it does you do actually you do", "104:46", "regular sweat it doesn't have to be from", "104:48", "sauna coming from exercise but you just", "104:50", "you do sweat out certain compounds like", "104:52", "aluminum aluminum flake it's funny that", "104:54", "you you can actually excrete certain", "104:55", "compounds better from sweat than urine", "104:57", "because that's another way of", "104:58", "eliminating things urine but aluminum", "105:02", "cadmium and there's one other that I", "105:04", "don't remember sweat it's like the best", "105:06", "way to get together just the", "105:07", "conversations you have with people that", "105:09", "are into releasing toxins it's like I'm", "105:12", "talking mumbo jumbo talk most of the", "105:15", "time I try not I'm trying not to judge", "105:17", "like I really have a hard time you", "105:20", "should when they start to go there I'm", "105:22", "like you should have a hard time and you", "105:23", "should judge I do well it's just they", "105:28", "say things that they don't really know", "105:30", "what the fuck they're talking about they", "105:32", "say it was such authority and I've had", "105:34", "those conversations in public saunas", "105:35", "before to work people are people like", "105:38", "they start getting into the toxins and", "105:40", "the whole Sun and like I'm just sitting", "105:41", "there quiet and I'm just like okay let", "105:43", "me start to tell you some benefits like", "105:45", "some real benefits cardiovascular did", "105:47", "you know that it actually mimics", "105:48", "exercise like literally like that's been", "105:50", "shown it's been like compared like 25", "105:52", "minutes in the sauna 25 minutes on a", "105:54", "stationary bike and same things are", "105:57", "happening you know like blood pressure", "105:58", "goes down afterwards heart rate", "106:00", "variability improves you know so same", "106:03", "things are happening you're increasing", "106:04", "plasma volume heart rate increases core", "106:07", "temperature increases right yeah", "106:08", "exercise is doing the same thing that's", "106:10", "the antidepressant effect like that I", "106:12", "feel from the sauna", "106:14", "and that Charles Rosen published you", "106:17", "know and that doctor dr. Mason will", "106:19", "hopefully carry on the torch it I think", "106:22", "it's real and I think that there's", "106:24", "there's potentially multiple mechanisms", "106:25", "immune we know modulations but also just", "106:29", "the fact that like BDNF you know there's", "106:32", "a study showing that hot baths do", "106:34", "increase BDNF", "106:36", "and BDNF brain-derived neurotropic", "106:38", "factor which why would you think", "106:40", "everybody would know what that means I", "106:41", "know brain dr9 D and F brain-derived", "106:56", "neurotropic factors yeah what's so", "107:00", "amazing about this neurotropic factor is", "107:03", "that it's always thought about in the", "107:05", "context of like brain aging because it", "107:08", "helps you grow new neurons it's", "107:10", "neurogenesis it helps us already", "107:13", "existing neurons survive but there's", "107:16", "studies now showing that it regulates", "107:17", "what's called neuroplasticity which is", "107:20", "like the ability like your brain your", "107:22", "brain changes you know with the changing", "107:24", "environment but you have to be able to", "107:25", "adapt to that right like children are", "107:27", "really good at that like they have a lot", "107:29", "of neuroplasticity", "107:31", "but neuroplasticity is its associate", "107:33", "with depression like not like not being", "107:35", "able like stressful conditions and stuff", "107:37", "like that like not being able to like", "107:40", "adapt I'm not using like the best of", "107:42", "terms but neuroplasticity is something", "107:44", "along those lines and so soon and BDNF", "107:47", "plays a role in mind BDNF has been shown", "107:49", "to be you know to increase with exercise", "107:50", "and also with heat stress I'm glad you", "107:52", "brought up hot baths cuz that's", "107:53", "something that I wanted to cover before", "107:54", "we got off track when we're talking", "107:56", "about sauna when people that don't have", "107:57", "access to a sauna how much benefit can", "108:00", "they get out of a hot bath Oh glad you", "108:01", "brought that up because there was a you", "108:04", "know so a couple of things one there was", "108:07", "a study that showed hot baths can have", "108:10", "an antidepressant effect and these", "108:11", "people were put in 104 degrees", "108:15", "Fahrenheit baths where they were up to", "108:18", "their shoulders for like 20 to 30", "108:20", "minutes and the Sham control was like a", "108:24", "green light like so people thought they", "108:27", "were getting a treatment they're getting", "108:28", "some kind of green light therapy or", "108:29", "whatever you know so it was a placebo", "108:31", "control because placebo is definitely", "108:33", "real particularly with depression and it", "108:36", "it had a pretty powerful antidepressant", "108:38", "effect very similar to Charles Rosen", "108:40", "study with the the hyperthermic chamber", "108:43", "thing when you say antidepressant", "108:46", "there's no real way to measure that they", "108:48", "have this", "108:49", "HUL yeah I mean so there are some cares", "108:52", "potential biomarkers being identified", "108:54", "c-reactive protein being one", "108:55", "inflammation inflammation plays a", "108:57", "there's like a huge link now between the", "108:59", "immune system and chronic inflammation", "109:01", "and depression brain function in general", "109:04", "bring an aging but inflammation so I", "109:07", "mean that's that there's there's a push", "109:10", "for looking but not all depressed", "109:12", "patients have it it's like there's a", "109:14", "subset absolute reactive protein but", "109:16", "yeah depressions measured it's a very", "109:18", "much like a you know have someone so a", "109:21", "subjective measurement would be a", "109:23", "clinical a clinical person like", "109:25", "measuring a whole battery of things they", "109:27", "do I forgot the name of the test but", "109:30", "yeah that's that's the test so it's like", "109:32", "basically a battery of feeling things so", "109:35", "it's not like a hardcore quantitative", "109:37", "biomarker which is so badly is needed", "109:39", "but um the hot baths have also been", "109:42", "shown so heat shock proteins which do", "109:45", "you like amazing there's so many amazing", "109:46", "things that heat shock proteins do", "109:48", "they've been shown to prevent muscle", "109:49", "atrophy and that's you know in the brain", "109:53", "they're so important like preventing", "109:54", "proteins from aggregating in the brain", "109:56", "that's how I first got in like one of my", "109:58", "first biological experiments ever", "110:00", "because I was a chemistry major in", "110:02", "college so I was doing all chemistry", "110:04", "stuff working a chemistry and like", "110:06", "chemistry but after I graduated I went", "110:09", "to work at the Salk Institute for", "110:10", "Biological Sciences in Hawaii I was", "110:13", "working in an aging lab and one of the", "110:16", "first experiments I had that I was doing", "110:18", "like one of my first projects was we", "110:20", "were taking the human amyloid beta gene", "110:23", "and and injecting him in these worms", "110:25", "these nematode worms that only live like", "110:27", "14 or 15 days and we were making them", "110:30", "form amyloid plaques in their muscle so", "110:32", "like basically you you look at these", "110:33", "little worms under microscopes is only", "110:35", "like half a mil or half a millimeter", "110:37", "you know they move around and I was like", "110:38", "they get older and they're aging they", "110:40", "don't move as quickly you know they're", "110:41", "kind of slower a little more decrepit", "110:43", "but anyways you give them this amyloid", "110:45", "beta and after like a couple of days", "110:47", "they become paralyzed or they're like", "110:49", "laying and their little petri dish plate", "110:51", "on the e.coli food you're giving them", "110:53", "and they kind of just move around just", "110:55", "to feed like their nose just moving", "110:56", "around and so when we would give them", "110:59", "tons of heat shock proteins in addition", "111:01", "to the amyloid", "111:03", "reversed it like completely mmm like", "111:05", "they would move around and be young so", "111:06", "anyways heat shock proteins play a role", "111:08", "in like neurodegenerative disease also", "111:10", "some links to like improving depression", "111:12", "in animal studies but can you measure", "111:15", "heating the baths versus yeah so that's", "111:18", "been done so the sauna I know of one", "111:21", "study where people that sat in a hundred", "111:24", "and sixty three degree fahrenheit sauna", "111:26", "for thirty minutes had heat shock", "111:28", "proteins their levels were fifty percent", "111:30", "higher over baseline and which is great", "111:33", "and that usually like animal studies", "111:36", "showed that that can they can stay", "111:37", "elevated for like 48 hours after that", "111:39", "there's a hot bath study where they also", "111:42", "elevated it wasn't quite as high but it", "111:44", "was like you know forty or so percent", "111:45", "higher than baseline levels and it was a", "111:47", "hundred and four degrees but this study", "111:49", "instead of doing it from the shoulders", "111:51", "down where I told you about the", "111:52", "depression it was like only twenty to", "111:53", "thirty minutes it was like from the", "111:54", "waist down so they had to stay in there", "111:56", "for an hour it's like a jacuzzi you know", "111:58", "what you're sitting there from the waist", "111:59", "down and like that's hot like saying 104", "112:02", "that's that's pretty hot but heat shock", "112:04", "proteins did increase so I think you", "112:07", "know for people that don't have access", "112:09", "to a sauna that hot baths absolutely are", "112:13", "a good medalie for heat stress and I", "112:18", "used it for a long time like I said I", "112:20", "just got us on like I've been I've made", "112:23", "a career about talking about saunas you", "112:25", "know and I just got one like last month", "112:27", "so like like I understand what it's like", "112:30", "to not have a sauna and to have to use", "112:31", "hot baths but I was also using the gym", "112:33", "saunas but right now it's like there's", "112:35", "no gyms that are open and so yeah", "112:37", "there's a hot baths are like the only", "112:39", "the only really choice if you don't have", "112:40", "a hot sauna an Oklahoma sauna what about", "112:42", "cold shock proteins and the I mean how", "112:45", "much difference is it between taking a", "112:48", "really cold shower ice bath versus", "112:50", "something like cryo cryotherapy like the", "112:54", "place that I took you to yeah so I mean", "112:56", "there's there's differences in in I mean", "112:58", "so it depends on how long you're staying", "113:01", "in a cold you know water like hold", "113:04", "shower like actually being submerged", "113:07", "like from like if you're like in the", "113:08", "ocean or something or a lake and you're", "113:10", "like from your shoulders down like", "113:11", "that's probably much more powerful than", "113:13", "just having the shower but by the way", "113:15", "the shower", "113:16", "like some days I'm like what doesn't", "113:18", "matter this this is not cold at all you", "113:20", "know it's just so variable where you", "113:22", "like Southern Southern California you", "113:24", "live on the right the border of Mexico", "113:26", "yesterday so so ever so most of time now", "113:29", "I shower right off his phone that's like", "113:31", "my shower time now and so like it's I do", "113:34", "about six minutes and it's so easy for", "113:36", "me I totally have adapted and I'm not", "113:38", "sure if I've just totally adapted or if", "113:40", "it's just like my faucets doesn't get it", "113:42", "just doesn't get cold that cold like it", "113:44", "really doesn't today I took a cold", "113:46", "shower from home and my son is not there", "113:50", "and I did it just because I wanted to", "113:52", "have the mood affects the north and", "113:53", "Efrain that's been shown to be increased", "113:55", "and it was much colder but then again it", "113:57", "was a different shower I'm not sure if",

to identify other", "135:31", "like the pancreatic pancreatitis drug in", "135:33", "Japan chemists at something", "135:36", "there's the pepcid I mean there's a lot", "135:37", "of different

things", "136:01", "that can therapeutically treat this you", "136:03", "know successively hopefully people are", "136:05", "gonna start looking at the vitamin D I", "136:06", "really like that I really hope that if", "136:09", "not just I hope people are gonna you", "136:10", "know take their vitamin D or ask their", "136:13", "doctor it's hey kit you know um but yeah", "136:15", "I think that in a couple months so like", "136:16", "can you wear a mask for a couple of", "136:18", "months and like here's why it's not", "136:19", "going to work to just have the people", "136:21", "that are vulnerable wear the masks", "136:22", "because the cloth mask isn't going to", "136:24", "prevent them from getting you know the", "136:26", "aerosol eyes droplets if you're", "136:27", "spreading it in asymptomatic which is", "136:28", "that it's been shown that you if you re", "136:30", "symptomatic that CDC study I mentioned a", "136:32", "while ago about how pre-symptomatic", "136:34",

and I", "136:58", "have I have family members that like", "137:01", "think it's like infringing their freedom", "137:03", "you know and like it does suck and I", "137:06", "know people are worried I mean the thing", "137:07", "is like also children I don't know how", "137:09", "to tackle that issue cuz it's really", "137:11", "hard that's that seems a little more", "137:12", "difficult but like

that seems like a good", "137:23", "compromise right it doesn't the children", "137:26", "it's real weird with this disease", "137:27", "because the some children are getting", "137:29", "sick but

before and lots of other", "138:33", "researchers have studied this sleep is", "138:35", "so important for immune function I mean", "138:37", "so important but I mean we're all not no", "138:39",

thankfully", "139:23", "has not been that bad I mean New York", "139:25", "City got hit pretty hard but you know", "139:29", "we've we have been on lockdown so that", "139:31", "has to be counted for you know I'd like", "139:32", "to see I mean in New York City", "139:34", "particularly when they were getting hit", "139:36", "you got to think this is New York City", "139:38", "in January which is January it's", "139:40", "wintertime people are not going outdoors", "139:42", "I wonder how much the vitamin D", "139:45", "deficiency varies dependent upon the", "139:48", "winter it's been shot

on whether or not it varies", "140:07", "between the East Coast and the west", "140:08", "coast because over here we do have all", "140:10", "these sunny days and power right outside", "140:13", "far

"140:21", "someone might have done that study I", "140:23", "would like to see that study because it", "140:24", "makes sense look and people are shittier", "140:26", "over there maybe that's why they're", "140:27", "shittier you know I mean they're cold", "140:30", "and grumpy I'm sure but also maybe that", "140:32", "is not feeling well because vitamin D", "140:35", "deficiency plays a factor in that as", "140:36", "well and I will also like to see", "140:37", "something done on whether or not that", "140:40", "contributes to how many people get sick", "140:42", "over there because when I lived in the", "140:43", "East Coast when I lived in New York I", "140:45", "got sick way more than I get sick out", "140:46", "here I'm for sure healthier more", "140:49", "cognizant definitely more I think all of", "140:51", "those things play a role personally I", "140:53", "think that you know that there's been", "140:54", "enough evidence showing that vitamin D", "140:55", "plays a role in is particularly", "140:57", "respiratory infections i psychosocial", "140:59", "stress like stress cortisol like that", "141:02", "but dampens the immune system you know", "141:04",

know", "141:21", "so I think all those things and then the", "141:23", "sleep yeah that's why it's so rough with", "141:25", "all these people stuck inside and", "141:27", "stressed out you know all these the", "141:30", "financial pressures that people are", "141:31", "experiencing right now because of the", "141:33", "lockdown yeah it's really it's so awful", "141:35", "yeah it is horrible it's horrible and", "141:39", "it's not getting better I hope I just", "141:40", "hope I hope that you know we can reopen", "141:43", "the economy in a very safe manner where", "141:47", "we don't have like flare-ups that you", "141:49", "know we don't want to be set back to", "141:51", "like shelter in place again like so long", "141:52", "you know I'm not gonna do it again I'm", "141:54",

and", "142:11", "if you want to wear a mask in public", "142:13", "that makes sense too okay I get it but", "142:15", "this it's like inside when you're in", "142:18", "places I think like if you're going", "142:20", "grocery shopping yes sure but test", "142:23", "people how about that", "142:24", "absolutely at work I mean I test", "142:26", "everyone that comes in here you told me", "142:28",

but yeah yeah", "142:52", "you know I don't you know I'm not sure", "142:54", "what factor do you think play like when", "142:58", "we're talking about solids before one of", "143:00", "the things

"conquer things yeah I'm a bit that way", "153:42", "yeah so that was the thing and then but", "153:44", "then I took a step back I was like I", "153:45", "think I'm fucking myself up here 180 180", "153:48", "is great I like 180 Fahrenheit for sure", "153:50", "yeah have I have I told you my xylitol", "153:53", "story I wanted to tell you this so I was", "153:55", "you chew gum I know you do I remember", "153:57", "like after show like you chew gum right", "153:59", "sure", "153:59", "do you use xylitol gum tell you my story", "154:05", "so that all is it's like it's from the", "154:09", "birch plant we were just talking about", "154:10", "it's the natural it's naturally found in", "154:12", "plants so it's that birch you know what", "154:14", "they're whipping it's from that plant it", "154:16", "yes it is used as a like if you're", "154:19", "eating it you know I think it could", "154:21", "cause like like the way that all kind of", "154:24", "thing effect where it's like too much GI", "154:26", "distress but when you're chewing gum or", "154:28", "using toothpaste these many studies have", "154:32", "shown that it kills anaerobic bacteria", "154:35", "like streptococcus Octus mutants that", "154:37", "cause cavities and dental decay really", "154:41", "so so here's my story like multiple", "154:42", "studies in humans showing this it's like", "154:44", "a big deal so I went this is before I", "154:46", "was before I had my son I went to the", "154:49", "dentist my dentist is really great and", "154:51", "he did an x-ray we're doing a cleaning", "154:53", "you know dental hygiene thing and and he", "154:55", "comes back and he's like you've got two", "154:56", "cavities cavities I don't need sugar", "154:59", "like you know I've just I've got like a", "155:02", "bad oral microbiome or something that", "155:04", "I've just for four years or I don't know", "155:06", "I shouldn't have cavities because I", "155:08", "don't need sugar but anyways I had so", "155:10", "because you have two cavities they're at", "155:11", "the point of no return", "155:12", "where you know like you there I guess", "155:15", "they penetrate the enamel a certain", "155:17", "amount and they're like you have to you", "155:19", "have", "155:19", "like get them out and so the way I am is", "155:23", "I always like to like look into", "155:24", "everything before I do anything it's", "155:26", "like okay this is not my field I", "155:27", "understand I told him I'm like I'm gonna", "155:29", "do some reading research and see if I", "155:31", "can find you know if there's any you", "155:32", "know possibility that don't have to like", "155:34", "get a filling right and he's like okay", "155:36", "well if you find anything please send it", "155:38", "my way so so then I found out it was", "155:41", "pregnant", "155:42", "and I was so I was like okay well I", "155:43", "can't go back to dentist and at that", "155:45", "point I I was like looking through", "155:49", "everything while my totally trees and", "155:51", "everything like what do I have to get", "155:51", "rid of what's in there that could be", "155:52", "harmful and so I was like fluoride like", "155:55", "in my toothpaste so I was like I don't", "155:56", "want to use fluoride toothpaste anymore", "155:58", "and these stories are going to connect", "156:01", "but so fluoride fluoride has been shown", "156:04", "a lot of people are worried about the", "156:06", "effects on the brain and the only solid", "156:09", "evidence I could find on negative", "156:11", "effects of fluoride on the brain are in", "156:12", "utero meaning pregnant women and you", "156:16", "know and the effects on babies and I", "156:17", "don't know if toothpaste has enough to", "156:18", "even do anything but in my mind I was", "156:21", "like no getting rid of the fluoride you", "156:22", "know I got a I got a water filter that", "156:25", "got rid of the fluoride in the water and", "156:27", "I was like doing all that so I came", "156:28", "across this xylitol toothpaste is highly", "156:31", "talked to the base so I started doing", "156:32", "research on xylitol while I was looking", "156:35", "for alternatives so I was like tom's of", "156:37", "Maine I can't use that crap I've tried", "156:38", "it before it's like makes your ass smell", "156:46", "worse anyway so so I was like I've got", "156:51", "to find something other than Thompson", "156:53", "Maine so I came across societal stuffs", "156:56", "and I started doing research and then I", "156:57", "found all these studies I'm not only did", "156:59", "I find studies that like it you know", "157:01", "basically kills these bacteria that", "157:03", "cause cavities that s mutants pregnant", "157:05", "women that choose I'll eat all gum by", "157:08", "the way the studies were with gum not", "157:10", "the truth base that people were chewing", "157:11", "this gum and pregnant pregnant women", "157:13", "like they were like six months pregnant", "157:15", "starting start at six months and they", "157:16", "chewed this xylitol gum all the way up", "157:18", "until anywhere between the child you", "157:20", "know the baby being six months and there", "157:22", "were some studies that went out like a", "157:23", "year and then they met the the the", "157:26", "researchers measured the oral bacteria", "157:30", "of the toddlers and then they measured", "157:32", "in multiple years out as they'd be", "157:33", "children and the mothers chewing it", "157:36", "chewing the gum it lowered the incidence", "157:38", "of the nest Newton's in the children", "157:42", "because you know mothers kiss their kids", "157:44", "and you transfer and oral bacteria and", "157:46", "so they're like they're chewing the", "157:48", "xylitol gum had a positive effect on the", "157:51", "child's oral microbiome and I was like", "157:54", "yeah I'm gonna do this I was like I gave", "157:57", "myself", "157:57", "TMJ like I chewed so much xylitol gum", "158:00", "while I was pregnant I'm like I still", "158:02", "like to this day I chew I have something", "158:03", "with me right now but

me about the stupid", "158:40", "cavities and I haven't done the research", "158:42", "you know and it goes he comes in and he", "158:45", "goes I've never seen this before but", "158:47", "your cavities are gone he shows the", "158:49", "x-rays and he shows me before and after", "158:50", "he's like they're totally gone and and I", "158:53", "was like that's amazing as like is it", "158:56", "the pregnancy's did he's like no he's", "158:58", "like we get women coming in your after", "159:00", "pain is like worse and I said the only", "159:03", "thing that I did like I could think of", "159:05", "is like my obsessive xylitol gum chewing", "159:08", "which I still do and the fact that it", "159:12", "does decrease that you know I don't know", "159:14", "how it would affect an already

microbiome", "159:45", "morale oh and it's showed there's also", "159:47", "studies showing that it decreases the", "159:49", "incidence of I said I'm talking about", "159:51", "Staphylococcus mutants because it's the", "159:53", "only one I remember but there's another", "159:54", "one that causes dental decay but it", "159:56", "didn't affect any of the good bacteria", "159:57", "in the mouth well so so I was like now", "160:01", "I'm just like it's all staff a caucus", "160:03", "mutant that that's the same is that the", "160:06", "same family that you get from staph", "160:08",
