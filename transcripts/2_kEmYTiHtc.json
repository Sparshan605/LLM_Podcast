ounces", "10:31", "of meat so no no the other thing is that", "10:35", "in order to get protein like if you can", "10:37", "get your you can get your protein from", "10:39", "beans say you have to have to get a", "10:41", "complete protein that's you have beans", "10:43", "and rice but in order to get you know", "10:46", "let's say 100 grams of protein you need", "10:47", "to eat like a thousand calories of beans", "10:50", "and rice versus say a couple hundred", "10:53", "calories of meat okay so don't hold me", "10:54", "to those numbers but I'm just telling", "10:55", "you eat a lot more calories right to get", "10:58", "the same amount of protein so for a", "11:00", "day's worth of protein you're saying", "11:02", "obviously wouldn't want a hundred grams", "11:04", "of protein in a single serving but", "11:05", "days worth of protein right you're", "11:07", "probably gonna eat an exorbitant amount", "11:09", "of beans rice right", "11:11", "yeah or broccoli or whatever the hell", "11:12", "else you're trying to eat what did like", "11:14", "iron is a big one right I know I have a", "11:16", "few friends that are vegan or have been", "11:18", "vegan and that was an issue with them", "11:20", "was iron yeah I mean I was a vegetarian", "11:23", "for over 25 years", "11:25", "well yeah and i was always anemic and i", "11:28", "took iron pills and that didn't

or the love", "24:09", "of it is gone that you're happy so and", "24:11", "that's what fat burners do and the way", "24:13", "to do that is to keep carbs low because", "24:16", "carbohydrate the moment you have glucose", "24:18", "in your blood system your body prefers", "24:21", "glucose it's a quick head of fuel right", "24:23", "your body will always prefer glucose and", "24:25", "once you

it", "25:04", "but once you so you want to stay away", "25:07", "from glucose in order to access your fat", "25:09", "that's just the reality and so fasting", "25:12", "is partly doing that you can do it for a", "25:14", "little while you can do it you know just", "25:15", "if you just fast in the mornings your", "25:17", "body is basically fasted all night long", "25:19", "you fast through the morning and then", "25:21", "you have you know you've your your fat", "25:24", "burning all that time yeah most people", "25:27", "are not aware of that you know it's this", "25:29", "is a relatively new situation I practice", "25:34", "it I do intermittent fasting I do a I", "25:36", "have a 14-hour window at night where I", "25:38", "don't eat and I think the more people do", "25:40", "that the more they understand that like", "25:41", "your body will burn off way more fat if", "25:44", "you just live like that if you just", "25:45", "force yourself to only inside of a 10", "25:47", "hour window yeah so the key to that is", "25:50", "you can't be eating a lot you can't be", "25:52", "on a high carb diet and then fast if", "25:54", "you're used to eating a lot of carbs", "25:56", "your

happy to", "44:11", "post if you want on there but and so ok", "44:14", "so that's a perfect example like what", "44:17", "was one of them was you know eating a", "44:18", "eating an egg or two a day is like", "44:20", "smoking 5 cigarettes", "44:22", "like crazy stuff right so just all of", "44:25", "that is based on that really weak", "44:27", "epidemiological evidence none of it has", "44:31",

scientific", "44:50", "claim of what the health and show that", "44:52", "it's based on this really weak", "44:54", "unsubstantiated evidence and but you", "44:57", "know these I think that one of the", "44:59", "reasons that that they made that film", "45:02", "was that you know we live we live in", "45:06", "very confusing times for science right", "45:09", "you you make a film you pull out some of", "45:11", "these heart heartstrings you know it's", "45:13", "very that's film is like it's very scary", "45:15", "you feel like oh my god there's poison", "45:18", "in the milk and now

irresponsible but dangerous well I", "45:31", "think so I mean but I think that what", "45:33", "you have is people pushing this diet for", "45:35", "you know ideological reasons as you said", "45:38", "you know they're they're the people", "45:40", "behind that film are you know two very", "45:42", "very well-known and animal welfare", "45:44", "activists who just don't want animals", "45:47", "killed and you know those are their", "45:50", "motivations and there are other people", "45:52", "who are have they say that they have", "45:55", "practices or kind of empires like Dean",

no", "46:26", "rigorous evidence to show that that diet", "46:29", "is safe or or you know or can fight", "46:33", "disease and they've actually you know a", "46:35", "few of these", "46:36", "and I doctors have actually done", "46:37", "clinical trials and there was where they", "46:40", "put people on a vegan diet okay so and", "46:42", "they were overseen by the vegan diet", "46:43", "doctor himself says John McDougall did", "46:46", "one of these he's he's here in", "46:47", "California so I mean the most biased", "46:51", "possible person overseeing this", "46:53", "experiment right he

eating that diet so", "47:05", "maybe it's a healthy diet but it cannot", "47:07", "be shown to be true and so it's fine to", "47:11", "eat it for whatever reason that you want", "47:13", "to but but

"64:01", "read if you read the science is about", "64:03", "evolving with me", "64:04", "that's just our reality so we can't you", "64:07", "know you can't really deny that and say", "64:09", "you know we did not spring", "64:11", "out of you know out of the side of", "64:14", "Athena or you know whatever we we we", "64:16", "evolved we evolved because we ate meat", "64:19", "there many

it's", "64:44", "pretty interesting but it's called the", "64:46", "stoned ape theory if you want to look it", "64:48", "up but the the idea that we are", "64:52", "herbivores and you hear this tossed", "64:55", "around a lot and you literally see like", "64:57", "vegan memes that show our teeth versus a", "65:00", "primates teeth or a rather a carnivores", "65:03", "teeth and showing that

things that I", "65:32", "explore in my book is the the way that", "65:35", "meat has been valued through human", "65:38", "history and it was valued as the food of", "65:42", "warriors and that you know like the", "65:45", "Maasai warriors who were studied by a", "65:47", "biochemist out of the university of", "65:49", "mineral in the late 1970s called the", "65:51", "Maasai warriors in Kenya

and there's another", "66:17", "interesting story about how that same", "66:20", "tribe was compared to they actually had", "66:24", "a kind of vegetarian", "66:25", "nearby and that when they were

I think they may have but", "67:21", "I don't you know they must have take a", "67:23", "lot of supplements and other kinds of", "67:25", "soy proteins or other you know other", "67:27", "things there's you have to be I mean", "67:29", "there there are there are replacements I", "67:32", "guess in the modern food supply but you", "67:35", "know historically based on real foods", "67:37",

want", "67:56", "to just pretend everything oh look on a", "67:58", "plant-based diet look at my amazing body", "68:00", "sorta yeah you definitely yeah I mean", "68:03", "yeah but that other stuff yeah you know", "68:06", "I mean this is something that gets", "68:08", "extremely ignored where it's way more", "68:09", "open and out in the non vegan", "68:13", "bodybuilding community yeah because I'm", "68:17", "deep into the body what have you out of", "68:24", "all this research and all this analyzing", "68:27", "this and you know the publishing your", "68:29", "book and the way it's been

"68:44", "a big question I mean there are a couple", "68:48", "of major ways this profoundly this whole", "68:53", "research changed my thinking one so one", "68:58", "was really that I it changed my

may I grew up in", "69:11", "Berkeley and was a real liberal Democrat", "69:15", "and still AM on most issues but you know", "69:19", "here I found an issue where the", "69:22", "government had started this program of", "69:26", "telling Americans how to eat and just", "69:28", "made this huge giant mistake and this", "69:32", "you know spent hundreds and hundreds and", "69:35", "billions of dollars on this program that", "69:37", "you know we have quite a bit of evidence", "69:40", "now I think to just make a pretty good", "69:43", "case that the government made America", "69:45",

the", "70:24", "potential to make mistakes the power of", "70:27", "government to that wants it once it", "70:30", "adopts a hypothesis or an idea of some", "70:32", "kind and then the incredible",

know I just wonder if I turn over", "71:42", "any other leaf what what at what else", "71:44", "would I find I think you'd find similar", "71:46", "incompetence probably yeah so so it's", "71:50",
