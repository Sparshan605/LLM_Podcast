a", "46:28", "bright line distinction between words", "46:30", "and deeds so I completely reject the", "46:32", "idea that words are violent violent yeah", "46:36", "totally yeah I totally reject that

can", "46:46", "speak other ground rules are that we are", "46:49", "committed to open expression a good", "46:51", "ground rule would be that we grant", "46:52", "positive intent we grant good

what does that come from like", "47:35", "why is it just because it's that's", "47:37", "really been the only way the society is", "47:39", "actually functioned for most of the I", "47:42", "think

"48:03", "know that that the way out is to have a", "48:05", "kind of imposition from above and I", "48:08", "think that's very dangerous actually and", "48:10", "this if we were talking about earlier in", "48:11", "college campuses", "48:12", "it's the same principle right like the", "48:14", "idea that Big Daddy is gonna come down", "48:17", "and tell us what to do and fix the", "48:19",

"48:29", "know words equal violence I mean this is", "48:31", "not a well thought through idea and this", "48:33", "is an idea that is worldly words lead to", "48:37", "violence sure words can be painful yes", "48:39", "they can hurt your feelings yes they can", "48:43", "be unpleasant all of that is true but", "48:44", "words are different than violence they", "48:46", "just are and so I think we need to you", "48:49", "know and in fact as John heightened and", "48:53", "Greg lukianov argue we actually might", "48:56", "want to create there are other reason", "48:57", "to draw the distinction between words", "49:00", "and violence and to cultivate an", "49:02", "appreciation for that distinction and", "49:04", "that is by allowing people to speak we", "49:07", "may actually reduce violence because we", "49:10", "can identify who has these crazy ideas", "49:13", "yeah we know who so if you're if if if I", "49:17", "believe that someone hates people like", "49:18", "me and I create an environment in which", "49:21", "we allow him to say he hates people like", "49:24", "me I think it's horrible that he hates", "49:26", "people like me I'm not defending that he", "49:27", "hates people like me but we might now", "49:30", "know who he is", "49:30", "Yeah right as I stay away from him ya", "49:33", "know so so that's their argument that", "49:37", "luciana fanhype make that that actually", "49:39", "this is a potentially additional", "49:40", "additional benefit of creating a free", "49:42", "and open marketplace of ideas is we", "49:44", "identify where the crazy is you know", "49:46", "here all these people were talking about", "49:47", "the anti-vaxxers I'd like to know who", "49:50", "are the people that hold these beliefs", "49:51", "because as a public

no this is gonna help this is uh", "50:39", "this is also part of deep platforming", "50:42", "yes people call for deep deep plan no I", "50:44", "think that's wrong even based on just", "50:47",

them", "79:10", "yes is the classic yes yes yes it's it's", "79:14", "a it's a simplified view of the world", "79:15", "and it's it's foolish and dangerous", "79:17", "actually yeah", "79:19", "now sometimes you're at war with an", "79:23", "enemy you know it's me or him and or us", "79:26", "or them there are circumstances in which", "79:28", "it's a difference of ival yes your level", "79:30",

exactly", "80:17", "right so um so this is you know I think", "80:20", "that the kind of that aspect of that", "80:22", "kind of training is is a life lesson as", "80:25", "well right the capacity to see that and", "80:27", "the same happens with ideas how do my", "80:29", "ideas get better how do I discover in my", "80:31", "laboratory new knowledge I discover it", "80:33", "against opposition right someone says", "80:36", "you're wrong about that it's not true", "80:38", "and I'm like oh yeah let me prove it to", "80:40", "you here's what I'm gonna go back and do", "80:42", "more experiments and come back to you", "80:43", "with more arguments and more data and", "80:45", "show you that actually I'm right about", "80:47", "this yeah or not you go back to your lab", "80:49",

good you're not gonna get any", "84:46", "arguments from me against on that yeah", "84:48", "at that point no um and I just think", "84:51", "it's better for everybody like we were", "84:53", "talking

"86:48", "very strange", "86:49", "well we we have a car serial state I", "86:51", "mean you know we lock up a higher we", "86:53", "have is we are fraction of people", "86:54", "incarcerated I think
