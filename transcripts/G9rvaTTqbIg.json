position", "04:38", "is gonna somehow lead to greater sales I", "04:40", "mean that's really the only reason that", "04:41", "you're gonna pay somebody more money if", "04:44", "they look and look it on you know I go", "04:45", "on fox television or CNBC it's not an", "04:48", "accident that all these women", "04:49", "interviewing me are pretty hot right I", "04:51", "mean unattractive women can

hot chick", "05:02", "interview me then a homely one and", "05:04", "they're probably right right because", "05:06", "probably lots of homely girls that are", "05:08", "applying for these jobs are not getting", "05:09", "hired no I agree with you 100% but", "05:11", "there's a fascinating thing that's going", "05:13", "on today where competition is thought to", "05:16", "be and somehow some way shape or form a", "05:18", "negative thing and that this kind of", "05:20", "competition whether it's cop even", "05:22", "capitalism itself is criticized right", "05:24", "like there's a lot of people today that", "05:26", "are in favor of socialism that's one of", "05:28", "the reasons why Bernie Sanders is so", "05:29", "attractive it's because like hey you", "05:32", "people that are not winning this crazy", "05:33", "competition out there that don't have", "05:34", "any desire we're gonna even out this", "05:36", "playing field and those people that are", "05:38", "out there kicking ass and taking names", "05:39", "we're gonna take some of that money and", "05:41", "we're gonna just give it to everybody", "05:42", "else yeah that is the appeal of", "05:44", "socialism because it appeals to the", "05:46", "lowest common denominator that'll just", "05:48", "appeal to ignorance but it appeals to", "05:50", "greed because it's an envy like oh this", "05:52", "person has so much more than me and it's", "05:54", "not fair but here's the beauty of", "05:56", "competition because this is why we want", "05:57", "competition we all want stuff right and", "06:01", "and so I want people competing to sell", "06:05", "me stuff right I want to have as much as", "06:08", "I can as far as consumer goods that's", "06:10", "what we all want we want products and", "06:12", "services that enhance our lives and the", "06:16", "way we get the best products right with", "06:18", "the highest quality that deliver the", "06:20", "most value at the lowest price is to", "06:22", "have lots of competition all kinds of", "06:25", "people competing for my business hey", "06:27", "I've got some money to spend Oh buy my", "06:29", "product buy my product competition is", "06:31", "what's make is what make sure that I get", "06:33", "the best thing that super hard to wrap", "06:37", "your head around yeah and there's the", "06:40", "big", "06:40", "you wouldn't get paid the big bucks if", "06:42", "it were easy but the big question is why", "06:45", "yeah why do you think this is all", "06:47", "happening or do you ever use that word", "06:49", "why it's why is a weird word right yeah", "06:52", "why is it weird is happening it is so", "06:54", "what's causing it to happen what are the", "06:57", "forces that caused it to happen yeah", "06:59", "ever why do you ever look at all and go", "07:00", "is there a purpose to all this so short", "07:03", "and I think the answer is no I think", "07:05", "they don't I think that yeah there's no", "07:08", "reason why and again just looking up", "07:11", "into the sky you know unless the purpose", "07:14", "was to make a pretty sky boy anything", "07:16", "that we're seeing here on earth could", "07:18", "have been done much with much less", "07:20", "effort than making a hundred billion", "07:21", "galaxies right there's no evidence in", "07:25", "anything that we've learned about", "07:26", "science or the universe that gives us a", "07:29", "reason to believe that there's a purpose", "07:31", "behind it all if anything as time goes", "07:34", "on the entropy of the universe is", "07:36", "increasing and the universe is becoming", "07:38", "more random and disorderly I think that", "07:41", "we're you know riding a wave of the", "07:44", "universe that is growing and expanding", "07:46", "and cooling and and becoming more and", "07:48", "more disorderly and that's a finite", "07:50", "amount of time so 14 billion years from", "07:53", "the Big Bang to today sounds like a lot", "07:56", "that's 1.4 times 10 to the 10 years but", "08:00", "the future of the universe is enormous", "08:02", "li longer than that according to our", "08:05", "best current theories it's its way it's", "08:07", "potentially infinitely long anyway the", "08:09", "last star is not going to burn out until", "08:11", "a quadrillion years from now we are very", "08:14", "close to the beginning of the history of", "08:16", "the universe and but it's not forever", "08:19", "doesn't last an infinite amount of time", "08:21", "so the universe is ephemeral we human", "08:24", "beings and living creatures are", "08:26", "temporary structures within it and the", "08:29", "idea that it's all for some big cosmic", "08:31", "purpose seems to hold very little water", "08:33", "do you ever contemplate what what", "08:37", "function human beings have in the in the", "08:40", "university the way we interface with", "08:42", "reality the way we interface with our", "08:44", "the nature with around us yeah I think", "08:47", "that we don't have the function I don't", "08:49", "think that's the right way to think", "08:50", "about what human beings are we should be", "08:52", "glad to be alive enjoy it while we're", "08:53", "here", "08:54", "be nice to each other and try to learn", "08:57", "more about the universe but it's not if", "08:59", "we choose not to do that that's not", "09:01", "going against any preordained function", "09:04", "that we have you're remarkably calm when", "09:06", "you discuss these things do you have any", "09:08", "existential angst do you have any like I", "09:11", "think the other way around and honestly", "09:13", "this is very very small amounts of data", "09:15", "but from what I can tell when personal", "09:20", "tragedies strike people who are", "09:23", "atheistic cosmologists and scientists", "09:25", "deal with it way better than people who", "09:27", "think that we're embedded in a matrix", "09:28", "with a bigger purpose or a spiritual", "09:30", "reality really yeah because you get that", "09:33", "this is this happen and you have an", "09:35", "infinite perspective when someone dies", "09:38", "it's sad you can be sad but you you", "09:41",
