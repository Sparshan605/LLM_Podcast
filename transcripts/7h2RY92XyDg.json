this phone but I've", "04:33", "heard everybody tape why don't they just", "04:34", "do the rest of the investigation well of", "04:36", "course they fucking done the rest of the", "04:37", "investigation they've done all the other", "04:39", "investigative steps so what are you", "04:40", "saying in a situation like this you just", "04:43", "want them to do 80% of the investigation", "04:45", "and if you've got you know that you've", "04:46", "got material on here whom which may lead", "04:49", "to operational activity in in finding", "04:52", "other people who were involved or",

not", "05:02", "asking for a backdoor they're asking for", "05:03", "that that one phone that's where this", "05:06", "whole thing is really headed south and", "05:08", "it's become this idea that you know", "05:10", "which is erroneous but I understand what", "05:12", "Tim Cook is saying about the precedent", "05:13", "although not really because again", "05:15", "they've done this before", "05:16", "for some reason for this one they're", "05:18", "drawn a line so anyway I bet I've heard", "05:20", "that why don't they just do the rest of", "05:22", "the investigation and skip this part", "05:25", "what I don't I don't follow that logic", "05:28", "train and then the other people other", "05:30", "people say well why do they just get it", "05:31", "off the metadata and and that's another", "05:33", "one of those things where people never", "05:34", "believed what the government was saying", "05:36", "but the meta fucking data was numbers", "05:38", "and volume that was it there was no", "05:40", "information to be had there you could", "05:42", "sit in the fuck in a room full of", "05:43", "metadata and not know what the hell", "05:45", "you're looking at you have to go through", "05:46", "the court process to then get that", "05:47", "particular numbers information so here's", "05:50", "my question because this is what came up", "05:52", "with the Edward Snowden thing they were", "05:54", "saying that the government is monitoring", "05:55", "all cell phone data constantly and they", "05:58", "can get information all the time well", "05:59", "this kind of proves that not to be true", "06:02", "yeah but people don't look at it that", "06:03", "way they don't they don't they don't", "06:05", "make that leap back and say oh well", "06:07", "maybe that was a fallacy yeah it sure", "06:10", "the metadata was sweeping up all that", "06:11", "those numbers and volume but again it's", "06:14", "not enough to what end yeah and so some", "06:16", "people would say once they realized what", "06:17", "it was actually doing then they'd say", "06:18", "well but that's so what so they're just", "06:21", "collecting this shit in the basement", "06:22", "it's not doing any good so they", "06:23", "shouldn't even collect that information", "06:24", "so what Edward Snowden was talking about", "06:27", "is essentially just when it pertains to", "06:29", "email I mean he said they're collecting", "06:32", "all this information that the NSA is", "06:35", "collecting all this information in", "06:37", "regards to cellphone data they're", "06:39", "recording every phone call", "06:40", "recording all these text messages yeah", "06:43", "is that not true well no I frankly I'm", "06:45", "here question nobody's gonna again this", "06:48", "very emotive right so there's always", "06:49", "people out there they can say fuck you", "06:51", "you don't know what the fuck yeah no", "06:55", "there is nobody right now unless you're", "06:58", "a terrorist a terrorist suspect or a", "07:00", "criminal there's nobody in the", "07:01", "government who so fuck about you on his", "07:03", "pics are safe ladies and gentle apicture", "07:08", "'he's that you've been floating around", "07:09", "throw your boyfriend okay go secure", "07:12", "nobody's gonna route those around", "07:14", "anybody who would rat you out for those", "07:16", "is a piece of shit and unamerican in the", "07:18", "first place yeah yeah so that's a that's", "07:20", "a really eye-opening thing though", "07:22", "because this case kind of throws that", "07:23", "all into jeopardy because everybody was", "07:25", "like concern like hey the government can", "07:27", "check in on all your phone calls and all", "07:29", "your text messages well this would", "07:31", "clearly be a case where they would want", "07:33", "to do that so I don't they can't do it", "07:35", "here without the the judge granting this", "07:38", "order and what so tell me why did there", "07:41", "was a recent court order that ruled in", "07:43", "favor of Apple they did and that was in", "07:45", "New York and that was an interesting", "07:47", "case as well and that's probably going", "07:48", "to set a precedent for the maybe maybe", "07:51", "we'll see because it's a little bit", "07:52", "different what the judge essentially was", "07:54", "saying in that case and it involved a", "07:56", "narco trafficking investigation that was", "07:59", "going on and and by the way this isn't", "08:02", "just for terrorism imagine what if this", "08:04", "was for pedophilia imagine a large", "08:06", "pedophilia ring what are you gonna say", "08:08", "no we don't want to catch those fucking", "08:10", "douchebags that are involved in that", "08:11", "because privacy you know I understand", "08:15", "the privacy aspect but each case has to", "08:17", "be looked at on its merits and and if", "08:19", "you say through the courts and through", "08:20", "the through the Congress that these are", "08:22", "the hoops that the bureau has to jump", "08:24", "through and they jump through those", "08:25", "hoops then then what then it's up to", "08:27", "each company to decide whether they want", "08:29", "to support it or not I don't know that", "08:30", "that seems strange but anyway the point", "08:31", "being is that the one in New York the", "08:33", "judge essentially was saying well look", "08:34", "you want us you want the courts to make", "08:36", "a decision on this for something that", "08:38", "Congress should really make a decision", "08:39", "on this and so he was in a way his", "08:41", "decision was a push back against the", "08:43", "concept that the the Bureau was basing", "08:46", "this on which is a very old law and so", "08:48", "the judge is saying look you relying on", "08:50", "a law that's a couple hundred years old", "08:51", "or whatever maybe instead we", "08:54", "should be having this looked at in", "08:56", "through the legislature and so there was", "08:59", "a there's an interesting sort of", "09:00", "legality to his his response to this but", "09:03", "it definitely favored apple and and and", "09:07", "and sure that's great let's legislate it", "09:09", "but do you think that just maybe there", "09:13", "are times when from an operational", "09:16", "perspective you might want to move a", "09:18", "little bit quicker then asking Congress", "09:19", "to take up an issue and debate it and", "09:22", "then maybe eventually come up so maybe", "09:24", "occasionally you're gonna have moments", "09:25", "like this the San Bernardino shooting", "09:27", "where you've got a phone in your hand", "09:30", "and all you're asking Apple to do is", "09:32", "take possession of it and and who knows", "09:35", "maybe their problem is they're worried", "09:36", "that if they create this if at that", "09:38", "moment someone's gonna steal it from", "09:39", "them mmm one of their employees so maybe", "09:41", "we got an internal security issue", "09:42", "because then they can destroy the", "09:44", "bureau's not asking for that phone back", "09:45", "they're not asking for that sift", "09:47", "they're not asking them for to do it on", "09:48", "any other what is a sip he says systems", "09:50", "information flow okay so you just force", "09:52", "it onto that phone that bypasses the", "09:54", "pass so essentially what the court has", "09:56", "done is made a very conservative", "09:58", "conservative interpretation of the law", "10:02", "right and basically saying that this is", "10:04", "musically this is a place where the", "10:05", "court should be decided we believe you", "10:07", "should be taking this to Congress and so", "10:08", "therefore I don't see why you're", "10:09", "legislating or asking us to make a", "10:11", "decision on this see I understand the", "10:13", "common person's perspective they don't", "10:15", "trust the government the whole Edward", "10:17", "Snowden thing like it makes thing", "10:19", "everybody's freaking out about that and", "10:20", "then they look at this saying well this", "10:22", "is the slippery slope again this is the", "10:25", "thing that if the government has access", "10:27", "to your phone but we're talking about a", "10:29", "fucking mass murderer and a guy who's", "10:32", "already dead and we have one phone yeah", "10:35", "yeah it's and and and so to say that", "10:37", "you're going to only do a limited", "10:39", "investigation even though you know", "10:41", "you've got potential information right", "10:43", "there's a way to do it like on an", "10:45", "individual basis just one phone only", "10:47", "that's what their ever that's what", "10:49", "they're asking but can it be that you", "10:50", "could never grant act I mean it's it", "10:53", "doesn't make any sense to me well I", "10:55", "wouldn't want to get access to that", "10:57", "guy's fuckin data and here's where and I", "10:59", "think going back to that overriding", "11:01", "theme which is nothing resides in the", "11:03", "center anymore you're right we do have", "11:05", "to be concerned about privacy and I", "11:06",

you a common PR reason two people", "11:19", "can exist in the comment in the middle", "11:21", "and say yeah", "11:22", "on this occasion because you've gone", "11:23", "through all these these orders and", "11:25", "because we've set up this protection now", "11:27", "meaning you know Apple holds on to it", "11:28", "but you know it that's not the way it", "11:30", "works and so therefore
