"68:23", "and I really saw his side of it for the", "68:26", "first time and he basically without", "68:28", "explaining it directly was like you know", "68:32", "that he's paying our label to get our", "68:35", "music what they do with the money he", "68:37", "can't control he's not really like that", "68:40", "at that moment I realized oh yeah", "68:41", "there's some stock being floated to", "68:42", "these companies which there was billions", "68:44", "of dollars of stock was sent and the", "68:46", "label has no obligation to give you", "68:48", "Megabus they gave us they gave us like a", "68:50", "couple hundred thousand dollars of it", "68:53", "out of the billion because they paid it", "68:56", "to us in a way the way the label does", "68:58", "was they paid it as an artist

and the", "69:08", "problem is is that I think not like okay", "69:12", "so my favorite bands for the most part", "69:15", "don't have hit songs they don't get", "69:17", "played on k-rock they don't have like a", "69:18", "Macarena type shit under that's gonna be", "69:21", "coming their way you know I mean and", "69:22", "that and that's what pays money is like", "69:24", "they because they treat almost every", "69:26", "stream the same it's like there's a", "69:28", "different variety rate for if you pay", "69:30", "for Spotify and there's no royalty rate", "69:32", "for if you're listening on the free", "69:34", "service but what they need to do in my", "69:36", "opinion is they need to say this guy is", "69:39", "a Joe listens to music he has good taste", "69:41", "in music he he he follows 500 bands", "69:45", "which means that there's no possible way", "69:46", "that he's gonna be listening to all 500", "69:49", "of those bands you know in even a six", "69:51", "month period of time", "69:52", "but when he does choose to listen to a", "69:54", "song it it's worth like X like 10x", "69:59", "versus this person who's listening to", "70:01", "Oldtown wrote a thousand times a day", "70:03", "yeah because Joe is like actually", "70:07", "engaging with our thing and not just", "70:09", "streaming this song for free", "70:10", "and like a monkey like my mama you know", "70:13", "like a Pavlov you know whatever mouth", "70:16", "salivating every time they hear those", "70:17", "little little Old Town Road wherever I", "70:20", "was I look at my Spotify thing and I'll", "70:22", "go months and I have all I pay for all", "70:25", "of them I have like YouTube Apple", "70:28", "whatever I don't have title but that's", "70:30", "because they didn't they gave ownership", "70:32", "to like 12 artists and they're like fuck", "70:33", "you let's fuck is that", "70:35", "just keep the ownership and pay a higher", "70:37", "royalty you fucking cocksuckers honestly", "70:41", "so I'm like so I think I look at my", "70:43", "Spotify I listen to like I was like a", "70:45", "hundred songs a month it's barely", "70:46", "anything and I'm like the way to really", "70:48", "do this it's fair is you take my ten", "70:50", "fucking dollars right and listen to a", "70:52", "hundred songs that's it because I've got", "70:54", "so many ways to listen to music that you", "70:56", "listen you take that ten songs and you", "70:59", "give every buddy", "71:01", "ten cents but that's not the way they do", "71:04", "it they're like we pay point zero zero",

take", "71:20", "seven bucks and throw it towards the", "71:22", "artists that would make sense to me but", "71:25", "they don't they're like they're paying", "71:26", "they're keeping all this fucking cash or", "71:28", "they're to keep it in a pile and then at", "71:30", "the end of day that is satiating like", "71:32", "you know Rihanna's 100 million dollar", "71:35", "check she gets every year you know I", "71:37", "mean if I know a lot of artists who just", "71:39", "they gets checks like two dollars and", "71:41", "fifty cents for a whole year on a record", "71:43", "that normally would sell like five or", "71:45", "six thousand copies but there's no need", "71:47", "like you have to basically be an idiot", "71:48", "to buy a CD nowadays you know because", "71:53", "it's a digital file that you ultimately", "71:56", "could download from Spotify on your", "71:59", "phone and have it with you forever", "72:01", "yeah you know unless you don't have the", "72:04", "Internet", "72:04", "you know if you're in Alaska or North", "72:06", "Dakota maybe you need to have a CD so so", "72:09", "few people are printing CDs then it", "72:11", "boils down to how much of an", "72:12", "infrastructure do you need as an artist", "72:14", "who how many people do you need to be", "72:16", "representing", "72:17", "you what how does your stuff get out", "72:19", "there doesn't it does it get I mean", "72:20", "especially with you guys doesn't it just", "72:22", "get out there because I mean I just", "72:24", "found out about you guys cuz somebody", "72:26", "tweeted it I got Mike oh who are these", "72:28", "guys I'm not worried about us bin it's", "72:31", "like the new bands coming out new bands", "72:33", "trying to break it that's what I'm", "72:36", "worried about yeah it's like we're fine", "72:37", "but it bums me out but I mean for", "72:40", "anybody in the business how much of an", "72:42", "infrastructure do you need in this", "72:43", "digital time well you just need someone", "72:45", "to figure out how to get it to people I", "72:46", "think it I think in a way it's like when", "72:49", "we first started our first record deal", "72:51", "was with a small label not far from", "72:54", "where we are here and the deal was this", "72:56", "give us 12 songs pay for the recording", "72:59", "yourself will master it which is the", "73:02", "final process of making a record that", "73:05", "cost a couple hundred bucks and we'll", "73:07", "send you 50 albums and we'll give you", "73:09", "like 12% of the money we make that was", "73:12", "it and oh and we're gonna have a $500", "73:15", "marketing budget that was out was that", "73:18", "that was the deal you know I mean so we", "73:20", "basically I mean we made this record", "73:22", "paid for ourselves", "73:23", "and we went on tour with this agent and", "73:27", "Ralph Carrera booked us a tour that kind", "73:29", "of a mercenary agent who would like", "73:30", "booked he booked the label I think paid", "73:32", "him a couple hundred bucks to focus his", "73:34", "tour and it all kind of started", "73:37", "steamrolling you know I mean but we had", "73:39", "no infrastructure we had no management", "73:40", "we had no agent we had nothing we just", "73:43", "kind of got in a van started going and I", "73:44", "think in a lot of ways nothing has", "73:46", "changed except for that when we got to", "73:49", "the second level you know the set liked", "73:51", "it there was a couple thousand dollars", "73:53", "there for us to make a record there was", "73:55", "opening slots that you know to arraign", "73:58", "was a little bit different then but I", "74:02", "think we've always kind of done it in a", "74:03", "way that was pretty DIY and the way it's", "74:06", "the same way it has to function now the", "74:07", "only difference is there's fewer record", "74:09", "labels that are gonna sit there and give", "74:11", "you fifteen thousand dollars to make a", "74:12", "record and maybe give you 10 grand to", "74:15", "help you buy a VIN and that's the", "74:17", "hardest step that's that's the threshold", "74:19", "for things bands are having a hard time", "74:21", "getting through you know once you get", "74:23", "through there then it's like then you", "74:25", "get to where we were four years which is", "74:27", "you're on a bigger label you're making", "74:29", "records and no one's paying attention to", "74:31", "you", "74:31", "the only reason why we ended up getting", "74:34", "attention paid to us I think by Warner", "74:37", "Brothers was for our wreck our six", "74:40", "record brothers it was a kind of a heavy", "74:46", "time I just turned 30 Dan just turned 30", "74:48", "and you know when he's turned 30 it", "74:49", "feels like you've gotten old you know I", "74:52", "mean and like especially in the", "74:54", "rock-and-roll business and we had this", "74:57", "good this record that I thought was", "74:58", "great and I went into when to talk to", "75:02", "Lyor Cohen with our manager uli or one", "75:06", "of the guys heads of Warner Brothers and", "75:08", "I and I was like we're like that were", "75:10", "the most synced band on Warner Brothers", "75:12", "which is when you get a song on a TV", "75:14", "show or a movie or a commercial I think", "75:17", "there's no other band for the last two", "75:19", "years this had as many sinks as we've", "75:20", "had but we've now I don't even know who", "75:22", "works the radio department at Warner", "75:25", "Brothers and we've been on your label", "75:26", "for like four or five years and Lior", "75:28", "basically like a that fuck he", "75:32", "prioritized us like that week and for", "75:35", "the first time was like we're gonna work", "75:37", "on your band and when that happened that", "75:39", "that's when the wall up loses shit", "75:41", "that's what a radio k-rock everything", "75:43", "fucking changed it took us six albums", "75:46", "and it took us all those sinks all that", "75:47", "shit all getting called sellouts all the", "75:49", "time for a while for Gavin our songs", "75:51", "calling yourself the same dudes it", "75:53", "wherever first shows that their arms", "75:54", "crossed sellout funny one you still do", "76:02", "the same music stupid to say music I", "76:05", "mean it's it's nice I think that you're", "76:07", "different I think I think that it cut", "76:10", "for this type of thing it comes from", "76:11", "that idea that like maybe like oh that", "76:14", "band like there I like to better when it", "76:17", "was at my secret my friend's nice right", "76:19", "okay so I don't want to share it with", "76:20", "this dude that's why I think it's", "76:21", "dangerous to have your song in certain", "76:23", "things like if your song comes on in", "76:25", "Walgreens you better watch out man", "76:27", "like that's a red flag because we've had", "76:30", "opportunities to have our songs sent to", "76:32", "like top 40 radio and there was this", "76:37", "thing where like if we one record of the", "76:38", "year for lonely boy Warner Brothers was", "76:40", "gonna service that song so top 40 it", "76:42", "would have never probably been a hit but", "76:44", "if", "76:45", "we would have one time that Grammy it", "76:49", "could have fucked a whole band up I've", "76:51", "seen it happen with lots of bands like", "76:52", "you just kind of it just like you become", "76:55", "like play school level yeah but do you", "76:57", "really think that you guys would change", "76:59", "just I think you go dude it's a check", "77:01", "that we would have changed but the thing", "77:03", "is is like you start accessing like you", "77:07", "start accessing you start have you", "77:09", "started acquiring it's a fan base that's", "77:12", "more fickle and maybe more annoying it's", "77:17", "like okay I bet you as a Cubs fan like a", "77:20", "Chicago Cubs fan in 2017 was like fuck", "77:23", "this World Series shit yeah every", "77:25", "motherfucker wearing a fucking Cubs hat", "77:27", "do you I'm saying yes and and I do I", "77:30", "know exactly what that food feel like", "77:32", "that's it it's probably the same thing", "77:34", "it's like someone's going in there to", "77:36", "get like someone's going to get a", "77:38", "shaving cream and this band that used to", "77:41", "play it like the fucking casbah and San", "77:44", "Diego is playing it well or checking out", "77:46", "like they're probably like fuck this", "77:49", "fuck this listen

place", "78:39", "he was the original guitar player in the", "78:41", "James Gang so he like Joe Walsh says", "78:45", "he's first saw him in like 65 or", "78:48", "something and he was like on somebody's", "78:50", "shoulders in purple bell-bottoms no", "78:53", "shirt playing electric guitar solo and", "78:56", "he said Joe Walsh", "78:58", "said that that guy made me want to play", "78:59", "electric guitar Wow you know and this", "79:03", "guy I used to go see him all the time", "79:05", "and he would play these songs which", "79:07", "happened to be religious which is just",

with that spirit it was", "79:48", "like and it was just the two of us and", "79:50", "we never even talked about working with", "79:53", "it we didn't even talk about it we just", "79:54", "put it in the books and we got together", "79:56", "because I knew that we always know no", "79:59", "matter what happens Pat and I can make", "80:01", "music because that's just who we are we", "80:03", "don't

"just like sitting at home I look at like", "80:33", "play counts of songs that one is one of", "80:36", "those songs that we recorded like this", "80:38", "is one of our best songs and it's it was", "80:40", "one of the least purchased at least it's", "80:44", "like it's like but it's funny I think", "80:46", "it's one of Dan's papers too it's like", "80:47", "it's fucking great song most of the", "80:50", "stuff that uh you know that's what's", "80:53", "important about music is it's just to do", "80:55", "what you are good at what you feel yeah", "80:57", "what you connect to and I think that I", "81:00", "guess that's alternate what I'm trying", "81:01", "to say is that like it's always been", "81:02", "this way where it's like there's always", "81:04", "been this noise of like you know", "81:07", "annoying annoying", "81:10", "kind of mainstream music and the problem", "81:12", "is is that because everything is getting", "81:14", "streamed on the same platform and there", "81:17", "there's no more in like there's less", "81:19", "independent record stores there's less", "81:21", "these there's no college music journal", "81:23", "there's nothing's kind of compared to", "81:25", "it's like you know you listen to like", "81:26", "the new like purple mountains record", "81:30", "which is a guy who unfortunately passed", "81:32", "away this summer friends of ours

whatever", "81:48", "Drake is doing that gets lost it's", "81:50", "completely lost in I I think that there", "81:53", "needs to be a better way to highlight", "81:55", "this stuff it's still crazy to me that", "81:57", "there isn't like a website that I can go", "81:59", "to as a as a crazy music fan that I", "82:03", "think is curating music that I actually", "82:05", "want to hear and I have we both have", "82:07", "really like open minds when it comes to", "82:10", "music but there isn't one thing it's", "82:12", "just like highlighting stuff from the", "82:15", "underground from mid-level rock have you", "82:18", "ever thought about doing something we've", "82:19", "talked about Rollins does it Rollins", "82:22", "does what does he do every Sunday he's", "82:24", "he's got a great show

hard because I think that", "82:55", "they're part of the problem actually", "82:57", "serious yeah like this the way that", "82:59", "they've programmed that the four or five", "83:01", "Rock channels like there's a channel on", "83:03", "there called the spectrum dan has a show", "83:05", "in there and um it's like the triple-a", "83:08", "channel which would be like KCRW here or", "83:10", "whatever like the Morning Becomes", "83:12", "eclectic I trying to think what what", "83:17", "song it was exactly that I heard but", "83:19", "they started tapping in like this should",

there's all these other factors", "126:14", "that come into it you know", "126:16", "and you try to help a band one thing", "126:19", "that worked for us would never work for", "126:20", "another band so there's no there's no", "126:21", "formula to it and it's it's really", "126:23", "random as I saw it's trying to it's", "126:25", "similar to this shit as like this chick", "126:27", "I know was talk I was talking about", "126:29", "ancestry.com and how she doesn't care", "126:32", "about her ancestors house like you don't", "126:33", "hear my ancestors that's interesting", "126:35", "because like think about the odds a few", "126:38", "existing it's like you go back just like", "126:40", "20 generations then that means that you", "126:42", "have like over a million grandparents I", "126:44", "think it's like 2 million grandparents", "126:46", "in just 20 generations they think about", "126:48", "all the fucking sperm and eggs and the", "126:51", "odds of those each one fucking me", "126:53", "happening it took 2 million a million", "126:55", "two million people fucking and that", "126:57", "happened over and over again to get to", "126:59", "your ass you don't give a fuck about any", "127:02", "of it I think that's just fucking", "127:04", "ignorant obviously like and if you like", "127:08", "and if you want to buy into the Elon", "127:09", "Musk's simulation remember this that", "127:11", "means there's some other fucker sitting", "127:13", "at the simulation who made that", "127:14", "motherfucker", "127:15", "so it's like you don't", "127:16", "the simulation hadn't been made by some", "127:19", "motherfucker like there's always", "127:21", "something deeper that thing about the", "127:23", "thing about any thing is it son explicit", "127:26", "it's unexplainable the fact that Dan and", "127:28", "I grew up next to each other the fact", "127:29", "that we were at close in age the fact", "127:31", "that we have able to put up with each", "127:33", "other's shit and find each other amusing", "127:36", "you know after 30 years of knowing each", "127:38", "other it's all fucking insane well you", "127:40", "guys obviously have a very good balance", "127:42", "well if you've been up and down you know", "127:45", "but we you know that has to do with a", "127:47", "lot of factors like we said you know not", "127:50", "over touring is pretty much the big one", "127:53", "right that wrecks people yeah yeah that", "127:56", "can pretty much take all the art out of", "127:58", "you suck all the life out of you fuck up", "127:59", "all your relationships yeah you just", "128:01", "don't want to be out there anymore", "128:02", "no it's our homes our you through the", "128:05", "whole thing you don't really buy into", "128:07", "the simulation do you me fuck no no but", "128:10", "I don't buy like what the same person", "128:12", "was saying to me that there are atheists", "128:14", "and they that's fine you're allowed to", "128:17", "believe that but you you also have to", "128:19", "accept that there's possibly that's not", "128:22", "true yes and like that's what I believe", "128:25", "and but then they went on to say that", "128:26", "they believe in demons and I was like I", "128:29", "don't know you got it I think my you", "128:33", "know that my rationale about all this", "128:35", "stuff is that it's it's simple I was", "128:38", "talking about to my stepdaughter who's", "128:40", "so smart so sweet and really changed my", "128:42", "life in a lot of ways and we were", "128:44", "swimming in the pool

well we don't go to", "128:57", "church or anything and I said I said I", "129:00", "don't know but I think this is something", "129:04", "interesting to think about I was like", "129:05", "whenever I think about that I try to", "129:07", "think about the end of the universe at", "129:10", "the very end like the edge and I can't", "129:14", "picture it as I can I can't picture as I", "129:17", "guess I can't and I can't picture like", "129:19", "infinity you know I can't grasp that at", "129:24", "all and I said the mere fact that we", "129:25", "can't grasp infinity will lead someone", "129:28", "like maybe Elon to believe that we're", "129:30", "purposely that was left off in some sort", "129:33", "of simulation or whatever but maybe", "129:35", "that's would be the argument I think", "129:37", "that that the fact that I can't picture", "129:43", "maybe I'm just an idiot but it makes it", "129:45", "that I think that there's maybe", "129:47", "something more", "129:48", "there's definitely something more to it", "129:49", "that possibilities way open but I do", "129:53", "think what do you think I had this", "129:57", "conversation with a guy who's actually", "129:59", "an expert on it it's got Nick Bostrom he", "130:01", "was trying to explain to me that because", "130:03", "of probability it's more likely or very", "130:06", "likely that we're in a simulation", "130:08", "because of the probability of someone", "130:10", "eventually creating it and that it's", "130:13", "very possible that we're in it right now", "130:15", "and more probable than not but then what", "130:18", "does that I mean there I don't know that", "130:19", "simulation has to be a simulation that", "130:21", "why would it's why a simulation of what", "130:24", "from what well here's something I know", "130:25", "for sure okay this is what I know for", "130:27", "sure this is by by my own experiences", "130:30", "that we are the only people on this", "130:34",
