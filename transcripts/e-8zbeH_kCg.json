debate because Joe", "08:00", "Silva claimed that there had been tests", "08:02", "Dunn's what he was telling me and I", "08:04", "believe him that showed that the correct", "08:07", "way of rehydrating orally actually led", "08:11", "to better results over a 24-hour period", "08:13", "I've heard that yeah that the IV thing", "08:16", "was good for short-term recovery from", "08:18",

"08:44", "off I've to the IV point I've heard", "08:47", "coaches say it's just for their head", "08:48", "they feel better once they", "08:50", "like they think they need the IV and", "08:52", "it's a lie complicit I've had coaches", "08:54", "tell me it's pretty much a placebo you", "08:56", "can't do it that much more now once", "08:57", "again I haven't read the studies but", "08:59", "I've had coaches tell me that that's my", "09:00", "quieter just needs to for his head it", "09:02", "used to be like what we'd assumed you", "09:03", "had to have like if a guy's gonna cut a", "09:05",

"10:16", "huge risk fighting is just a huge risk", "10:18", "period to not take another huge risk", "10:21", "just the mentality of if I have to do", "10:23", "this to win I'm gonna do it it's you", "10:26", "know you're saying all they need they", "10:27", "can't take that risk well they're", "10:28", "already you're already have the", "10:29", "personality of I don't care what I have", "10:31",

"about a a group of people that are", "10:40", "already used to taking a huge dangerous", "10:43", "physical risk to even get in there so", "10:45", "adding on the weight cut they're gonna", "10:48", "take that gamble every time you know", "10:49", "it's crazy if they can one Fc though is", "10:53", "instituting some interesting new rule", "10:55", "changes and one Fc", "10:56", "is doing

"half the car falls apart yeah wonder", "11:38", "what they did there's a win with this", "11:40", "that's my question well they'd have to", "11:41", "do it early and blow all the weight", "11:43", "glasses up yeah that's weird", "11:45", "we were having this conversation", "11:46", "everybody on at least or if you don't", "11:48", "even shift them one you find out like", "11:51", "what what wait are you really you know I", "11:53", "mean you could be like a Luke Rockhold", "11:54", "dude who's a giant 185 or I mean Luke", "11:57", "easily looks like he could be a heavy", "11:59", "weight he's walking around is he he's", "12:01", "like 220 or 230 or something like that", "12:03", "and then he gets to I mean maybe he's", "12:04", "mad at me right now I don't", "12:08", "I might be exaggerating but at the very", "12:12", "least when he gets down from down to 185", "12:15", "he's probably coming from 200 plus", "12:17", "pounds and a big tall 205 but then", "12:20", "there's other guys that just don't cut", "12:22", "that much at all", "12:23", "and but what gets me is there's no hard", "12:27", "and fast body type rule like I said Doug", "12:29", "Simon is huge he makes it every time you", "12:31", "ever talk to him about how he does it uh", "12:34", "he's told me little things he used to", "12:36", "not do it well and he looked like death", "12:38", "in the last few fights he's looked much", "12:40", "better so yeah he just he tended to be", "12:42", "wound up to like to 10 to 15 and he's", "12:44", "American Top Team right yeah yeah", "12:46", "coconut creek tub oh it's somewhere oh", "12:50", "really somewhere down south where he's", "12:52", "you might go there to spar or something", "12:53", "but he's he's not at the main main", "12:56", "facility muscle if there are they all", "12:57", "like integrated like gracie baja yeah", "13:00", "the same team so he goes around to get", "13:02", "work but it's it's and then i have guys", "13:05", "you know for
