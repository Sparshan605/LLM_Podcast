Gerald", "115:45", "McClellan and it was a big big fight at", "115:47", "the time because they were both just", "115:49", "knockout artists and crazy wild dudes", "115:51", "with ferocious punching power and Gerald", "115:54", "McClellan cut a shit ton of weight", "115:56", "really way too much weight and he was a", "115:59", "really big light heavyweight and when he", "116:01", "went in there and fought Gerald", "116:03", "McClellan or when he fought on Nigel", "116:05", "Benn rather they had a clash of heads", "116:07", "and it was a crazy like non-stop first", "116:10", "round action

fight was over and Nigel pin", "116:21", "comes back he gets back up and they're", "116:23", "going at it and there's a crazy headbutt", "116:25", "in there too and during the headbutt I", "116:27", "mean they're throwing bombs back and", "116:29", "forth but um", "116:30", "Jeremy Cleland takes a knee shortly", "116:33", "afterwards and then goes to his corner", "116:35", "and stops and the the people that are", "116:38", "watching", "116:38", "I remember saying like why is he doing", "116:40", "that like why would he stop a fight like", "116:42", "you know it doesn't make any sense and", "116:44", "then boom he he's fucked and then they", "116:47", "take him to the hospital and this is in", "116:50", "this is what was around 10 right before", "116:52", "I think I saw this is right before the", "116:54", "the headbutt yeah", "116:55", "so during the first round I see I", "116:57", "thought it was a shorter fight see", "116:59", "during the first round they had collided", "117:01", "and Jarrell McClellan hit him with some", "117:05", "big shots and it looked like the fight", "117:07", "was over I'm pretty sure that was the", "117:08", "first round but when when whenever", "117:13", "happened happened oh look at that right", "117:15", "hand by Nigel BAM oh that's ferocious oh", "117:17", "dude", "117:18", "remember this wrong I remember a clash", "117:22", "of heads look at that I though man damn", "117:27", "my 100% remember this wrong see cuz he", "117:29", "got up and he's in trouble", "117:33", "and Nigel Benz hittin him again see I", "117:35",

"head oh look at that uppercut he hit him", "117:43", "with mmm", "117:44", "so I think this is winning the fight so", "117:48", "I think he was a really struggling at", "117:50", "this point I think he waited out his", "117:56", "whole count that's it", "117:57", "he waited out his whole count on his", "117:59", "knee and I think some people were", "118:02", "critical of that a time this is crazy", "118:06", "man so anyway after this fight Gerald", "118:13", "McClellan had severe brain bleeding and", "118:17", "was taken to the hospital and he's never", "118:19", "been the same since

ko", "118:31", "highlights the thought was that it was", "118:34", "going to be one day Gerald McClellan", "118:35", "versus Roy Jones jr. that they were", "118:38", "gonna have a super fight that was like a", "118:39", "big like one of them Pacquiao Mayweather", "118:42", "type fights for that era Wow mega hit", "118:45", "hard man I mean it hard getting hit in", "118:47", "the face like that well how do I", "118:49", "remember him getting head back", "118:51", "maybe I'm just completely delusional or", "118:53", "maybe that was somewhere in that mix but", "118:55", "certainly it was the big bombs from", "118:58", "McClellan that uh", "119:00", "dropped him in the first round and the", "119:03", "big bombs from Nigel Benn I want to see", "119:05", "the the first round too because i from I", "119:07", "remember it was a crazy comeback because", "119:09", "Nigel Benn was really hurt in that first", "119:12", "round but just showed insane heart and", "119:16", "figured out how to keep going where a", "119:18", "lot of people like this fight is over", "119:19", "this fight is over but you see in those", "119:24", "highlight reels he was a knockout on man", "119:26", "but now he's he's in real real real real", "119:28", "bad shape he's in a wheelchair", "119:31", "he from that fight he he went blind he", "119:35", "he had severe bleeding on his brain and", "119:38", "never really recovered he could died in", "119:41", "the ring oh he absolutely could have", "119:42", "died so here's the first round look at", "119:44", "this first round insane you think", "119:46", "they're gonna win look at this Nigel", "119:47", "Benn falls through the ropes go go back", "119:49", "a little bit go back a little bit so you", "119:51", "can see how fuckin and saying this go to", "119:53", "the beginning of it you see how insane", "119:56", "this combination is I mean McClellan", "119:58", "came out guns blazing and hit him with", "120:01", "some serious bombs man look at this he", "120:04", "hit him with a couple of good shots", "120:05", "they're good right hand a good lead hook", "120:07", "left hook to the body so this is the", "120:09", "beginning in the fight you're thinking", "120:10", "oh my god this fight is fucking over", "120:12", "look at that left hook left hook to the", "120:15", "body right boom boom I mean MacLeod was", "120:17", "a destroyer look at this and this is", "120:19", "when he's blasting them through the", "120:21", "ropes you like holy shit this fight is", "120:24", "over Nigel Benn comes back from this to", "120:27", "win like ten rounds later which is", "120:29", "insane insane look at him I mean clearly", "120:33", "he's hurt it's kind of wobbly but Jerry", "120:36", "McClelland just couldn't keep this up", "120:39", "Nigel Benn survived and came back those", "120:42", "are like mad intangibles in a fight", "120:45", "that's why the best description of", "120:47", "fights is always the theater of the", "120:49", "unknown because you really never know", "120:50", "what the fuck is going to happen when", "120:53", "you get these two world-class knuckle", "120:55", "slingers throwing fucking haymakers head", "120:59",

"121:09", "get knees they're giving it up my cousin", "121:11", "yeah I mean you gotta think what kind of", "121:12", "output he's put he's trying to win this", "121:14", "fight and Chael Sonnen told me something", "121:17", "once that's a old boxing it's saying", "121:22", "something along the lines of if you try", "121:25", "to stop a fight and win by knockout", "121:28", "but fail you almost always lose by", "121:30", "decision because you just blow yourself", "121:33", "out so bad obviously that's not totally", "121:37", "the case cuz some people have crazy", "121:39", "endurance and they can try to win a", "121:41", "fight by knockout and then recover", "121:42", "around later", "121:44", "but did the amount of output that you do", "121:46", "when you're throwing everything full", "121:48", "blast like McClellan did in that first", "121:50", "round is insane", "121:51", "it's like sprinting how many punches", "121:53", "he'd throw that first round he threw a", "121:55", "lot but here's the most important thing", "121:57", "he's throwing a lot of them at full", "121:59", "power that's why it's so difficult to", "122:02", "maintain well most people don't realize", "122:04", "is that most of the time you see boxers", "122:07", "boxing they're throwing punches fast but", "122:11", "they're being loose and fluid and when", "122:14", "they heard a fighter that's when they", "122:16", "expend the most energy because then", "122:17", "they're digging in glass and they're", "122:20", "winding up they don't normally do that", "122:22", "so the amount of energy that it takes to", "122:24", "wind up and throw your hips and your", "122:26", "fucking ass into it and all your weight", "122:29", "and explode at the end that's much more", "122:32", "than to be just a technical boxer so", "122:35", "when they're throwing technical punches", "122:36", "and they're moving fast they're not", "122:39", "exerting the same amount of energy see", "122:41", "when when you're trying to knock", "122:42", "somebody out like McClellan clearly", "122:44", "wasn't this first round you are running", "122:46", "uphill with a weight sack on yak and you", "122:49", "can only do it for so long so as we go", "122:51", "into the second round like look he's", "122:53", "he's already really tired so it was his", "122:57", "lunch length pitch right there it was as", "122:59", "much his weight cut as it was his", "123:02", "strategy to try to win the first round", "123:04", "as it was", "123:05", "Nigel Ben's ability to absorb punishment", "123:07", "and come back strong because Ben is", "123:09", "looking fantastic here in the second", "123:11", "round look at him but it was a big", "123:14", "wake-up call to a lot of boxers that if", "123:16", "you engage in wild brawls even when you", "123:19", "were one of the elite of the elite like", "123:20", "Gerald McClellan was at the time you", "123:23", "could still get you know brain bleeding", "123:25", "and be fucked up and a lot of people", "123:27", "attribute that to that weight cut", "123:28", "because he had to here dehydrate himself", "123:30", "quite a bit back then you think his game", "123:31", "plan from his coaches was get to the guy", "123:34", "out in the first round it could be but", "123:36", "it could be that he heard I mean he", "123:37", "figured he could get him out in the", "123:38", "first round you know I mean McClellan", "123:40", "was a killer that was his thing if he if", "123:42", "he hurt you he was coming after you so I", "123:44", "what's that I had 14 straight knockouts", "123:46", "and ten were in the first round yeah", "123:48", "that's what Jeremy Cleland did so when", "123:51", "it didn't work out against a guy like", "123:52", "Nigel Benn Nigel Benn figured out how to", "123:54", "maintain his energy better", "123:57", "that fight that's a you know that's a", "124:00", "dangerous strategy empty all you bullets", "124:02", "out in the first round", "124:03", "huge is done defense for the first three", "124:06", "rounds and huh but meanwhile like the", "124:08", "the that's what was his success formula", "124:11", "up until then you know I mean I was that", "124:13", "was what was working you don't know it", "124:15", "doesn't work it don't work anymore", "124:16", "fourteenth straight not close that way", "124:18", "yeah", "124:18",
