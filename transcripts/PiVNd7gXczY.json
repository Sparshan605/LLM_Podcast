"111:06", "like part of the deal they give them", "111:08", "beer and they massage them is there a", "111:10", "happy ending", "111:12", "no because they're steers so if they're", "111:14", "steers it means in on any balls you know", "111:16", "a steer is they take a bull they cut his", "111:19", "balls off and that's what a steer is so", "111:21", "most the time when you're buying if you",

producing milk", "111:34", "or you get to a certain age and they", "111:35", "shoot them and then they grind them up", "111:36", "but if you buy steaks like USDA prime", "111:40", "t-bone get a nice t-bone steak that's", "111:42", "coming from a steer so that's a cow that", "111:44", "cut his balls off and then they fatten", "111:48", "them up huh yeah I know that ground beef", "111:50", "is the the cow sometimes I think ground", "111:53", "beef sometimes can be steer to like", "111:55", "certain cuts you know I think in some", "111:57", "cases I hope I'm not wrong about this", "111:59", "but

"112:06", "released they say when they slaughter", "112:08", "beef that they get scared adrenaline", "112:11", "then that you're eating some kind of a", "112:13", "chemical sometimes as a result well", "112:15", "there is a definite taste that people", "112:17", "think happens to an animal when they're", "112:20", "scared and you if you shoot an animal", "112:24", "and it's wounded and it's scared and", "112:26", "maybe you have to follow up with a", "112:28", "second shot or something like that that", "112:30", "animal will not taste as good as an", "112:32", "animal that has no idea what hit it", "112:34", "yeah that's why there's a guy that I", "112:37", "know that's a chef of a very famous San", "112:39", "Francisco restaurant", "112:41", "say Psalm I think it is I think

"113:16", "no idea what happened boom they're dead", "113:18", "no adrenaline dump nothing and then that", "113:20", "way according to him you get the finest", "113:24", "flavor from the food Wow", "113:25", "yeah that's a harder shot too because", "113:28", "that's the thing that's moving the most", "113:29", "on the animal the head could be I mean", "113:31", "it could just be sitting there I'm", "113:32", "eating a lot of times they're eating", "113:34", "grass or something like that I mean this", "113:35", "is obviously we're talking about wild", "113:38", "animals you know it would be really easy", "113:40", "to do for a cow or something like that", "113:42", "they would have no idea they're just", "113:44", "sitting there eating you could set up on", "113:46", "a bench with a
