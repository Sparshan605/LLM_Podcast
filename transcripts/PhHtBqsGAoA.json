actually thought about that and", "24:10", "that's their solution so that must mean", "24:13", "there be planets that you could find", "24:14", "that that well here's the thing we have", "24:17",

if", "24:59", "you have too much oxygen if you have", "25:01", "like let's say 50% oxygen you're really", "25:03", "high right what happens is like a forest", "25:08", "fire would never go out oh yeah yeah", "25:10", "because oxygen feeds combustion and so", "25:13", "you could basically burn all vegetation", "25:15", "in the world if the oxygen went above", "25:17", "certain thresholds so you need it high", "25:20", "enough so that you can still have oxygen", "25:21", "metabolism but not so high that it's bad", "25:24", "for lightning triggered forest fire so", "25:28", "if there if in this if I don't know the", "25:31", "announcement but I'm just guessing here", "25:32", "because it's been a cottage industry the", "25:34", "last couple of years let's find these", "25:36", "biomarkers do you have unstable", "25:38", "chemistry going on in that atmosphere", "25:41", "because if you do it means something's", "25:43", "generating it and and certain", "25:45", "combinations of chemistry tells you", "25:47", "there's likely to be life of some kind", "25:50", "now just a couple decades ago we had", "25:52", "speculation of other planets but we", "25:55", "really didn't have any

audience leans young", "26:07", "so there'll be some fraction of the", "26:09", "audience it'll raise their hand and so", "26:12", "what I do is I Knight them as generation", "26:15", "exoplanet

oh yeah I", "26:36", "was living out here yes 20 is 24 years", "26:38", "ago", "26:38", "22 years ago yeah that's it that's", "26:40", "insane if you stop and think about how", "26:42", "what a short period of time it is and in", "26:44", "that period of time there's like rising", "26:46", "through 3,000 exoplanets this is the", "26:49", "advance of tape that that's not just", "26:50", "science advanced that's that's", "26:51", "Engineering and Technology and", "26:53", "intelliscan and imaging quality and it", "26:57", "is a lot that goes on to the advance of", "26:59", "science it's not just how clever you are", "27:01", "in an Einsteinian way it's do you know", "27:03", "good engineers to build a device to make", "27:06", "the measurement this is how we", "27:07", "discovered gravity waves", "27:08", "now what's your take on that planet", "27:10", "that's supposed to be outside the Kuiper", "27:12", "belt", "27:12", "that's planet 9 so far yeah yeah all the", "27:16", "data look convincing so what they've", "27:18", "done is they've looked at other objects", "27:20", "in the Kuiper belt and looked at these", "27:22", "are colleagues of mine at Caltech so", "27:25", "it's it's a Mike Brown who you know I", "27:28", "get blamed for killing Pluto but I was", "27:31", "an accessory for sure but I didn't", "27:32", "definitely didn't kill that dude kill", "27:34", "Pluto all right he found another object", "27:36", "that was basically the size of Pluto out", "27:38", "there so either you make that a planet", "27:41", "or you demote Pluto and how much smaller", "27:43", "is Pluto and say our moon oh so so don't", "27:46", "get me started our moon has five times", "27:48", "the mass of Pluto so the moon the", "27:51", "Pluto's was lame from the beginning all", "27:54", "right we thought it was big we wanted it", "27:56", "to be big we we we made it one of us one", "28:00", "of the nine and it's size didn't settle", "28:02", "out until the late 1970s when we had", "28:05", "better and better more accurate ways to", "28:07", "measure its size and that's when we", "28:08", "learned it's small even compared to our", "28:10", "own but granted we have a big moon", "28:13", "if you're not gonna think our moon is a", "28:15", "planet you're certainly not gonna think", "28:16", "the Pluto is a planet so this hop you", "28:18", "let me just tell you how they did so", "28:19", "they found these other objects out there", "28:20", "the same team a Constantine but gives", "28:25", "pronounce his last name but ding Jian", "28:27", "and Mike Brown but both at Caltech and", "28:31", "they found these objects in the outer so", "28:33", "the Kuiper belt of icy bodies we're of", "28:35", "which pluto is a member you track their", "28:37", "motion and you say okay if I add up all", "28:40", "the gravity that's affecting them and", "28:41", "they should move this way but they don't", "28:43", "they move another way a different way so", "28:45", "either Newton's laws of gravity are", "28:47", "failing in the outer solar system or", "28:50", "this some object out there whose gravity", "28:52", "you have yet to reconcile with the", "28:54", "motions of these objects so they said", "28:56", "let's assume Newton is right what object", "28:59", "do we have to put out there at what", "29:01", "distance and at what size to influence", "29:04", "the movement of these Kuiper belt", "29:05", "objects in the way we see it and do they", "29:07", "do this through bodes law no no we're", "29:09", "way past winner no we wait wait thanks", "29:12", "for remembering both law but both law", "29:13", "was an early measure of where you might", "29:16", "find a new planet it was based on mass", "29:18", "and gravity no no both law was a simple", "29:21", "arithmetic tool all the did was", "29:23", "basically double the distance with a", "29:24", "certain additive parameter double the", "29:26", "distance of some planets so for example", "29:31", "you know and there was a little there's", "29:34", "a factor in there that helped the inner", "29:35", "planets come out right but let's look at", "29:38", "Mars Mars is like 2 and 1/2 times", "29:40", "Earth's distance from the Sun what comes", "29:44", "after Mars Jupiter Jupiter is five times", "29:46", "her assistants ah", "29:47", "Saturn is 10 times 1 to the 5 to 5 to 10", "29:50", "so Bob's law is just a simple arithmetic", "29:53", "scheme it's not based in any known", "29:55", "physics it was only based on the solar", "29:57", "system in the solar system itself that's", "29:59", "right so and it worked and yet you have", "30:01", "to fudge your way to get mercury to work", "30:03", "in that oh really and it wouldn't didn't", "30:05", "have Pluto", "30:06", "of course pool it wasn't a plan in any", "30:07", "way but anyhow it was a it was a is a", "30:10", "fudgy way that was mostly right by", "30:13", "accident and this was in like what year", "30:15", "was this oh that was 1,800 spaces oh", "30:19", "yeah yeah so now we have advanced", "30:22", "computer programming very high precision", "30:24", "modeling and there's", "30:25", "there's got to be a planet somewhere", "30:27", "here in this arc of the sky let's look", "30:30", "for it", "30:30", "because we think that's what's affecting", "30:31", "the orbits of these other objects and", "30:32", "that is a completely noble way to", "30:34", "discover a planet that's how Neptune was", "30:37", "discovered and because now everyone", "30:40", "looked at the orbit of Uranus and said", "30:43", "you know Uranus is not following", "30:44", "Newton's laws", "30:45", "maybe maybe Newton's laws don't work", "30:46", "that far out has never been tested that", "30:48", "far and they say well let's let's assume", "30:50", "it works and ask what would have to", "30:53", "influence it and whether it's a", "30:55", "difficult mathematical calculation", "30:56", "because you're not saying here's the", "30:57", "object what's the gravity field you're", "31:00", "saying here's the gravity field", "31:01", "I need where must the object be and how", "31:05", "massive must it be that's a much harder", "31:08", "mathematical problem to solve and so", "31:10", "once the the the the errant orbit of", "31:15", "Uranus was known and calculated they", "31:19", "started looking for another planet and", "31:22", "that's how they discovered planet", "31:23", "Neptune Wow", "31:24", "so now when they're looking at this", "31:25", "planet 9 I hope I said that right it was", "31:27", "the movement of Uranus's orbit was not", "31:30", "following proper laws and they inferred", "31:32", "the presence of Neptune they said look", "31:33", "here tomorrow night and they looked", "31:36", "there and they found it Wow", "31:38", "yes it was a brilliant display of and no", "31:41", "we're going back to the 19th century so", "31:44", "I mean people people were badass that", "31:47", "every generations got their badass", "31:49", "scientists now how much further out from", "31:51", "the known solar system is this planet so", "31:55", "I'm not quick to call it planet 9", "31:56", "because so far it's twenty thousand", "31:59", "times farther away from the Sun than the", "32:01", "earth is so I'm not sorry you're not", "32:07", "sorry I'm not feeling like calling", "32:10", "Connecticut New York City so but it's", "32:14", "something massive right it's like six", "32:15", "times the mass of yeah I forgot what", "32:17", "mass they were assigning it but yeah it", "32:19", "would if that were in our solar system", "32:21", "to be no question you would label it as", "32:23", "a planet and it wasn't there one time", "32:25", "speculation that it was some sort of a", "32:26", "burnt-out star no not that mass no no no", "32:30", "no you might be thinking you're if", "32:31", "that's what I think you're thinking you", "32:33", "got good memory the long ago in a galaxy", "32:35", "far away so I'm talking about 1970s", "32:39", "people looked at the extinction record", "32:40", "on earth and every 20,000 years they", "32:43", "found a little blip a little dip in the", "32:46", "fossil record where we lost some species", "32:48", "and people were wondering why could", "32:50", "there have been some flux of comets", "32:53", "raining down periodically on the

"33:07", "Ryanair a star system so they invoked it", "33:10", "and then they called it they gave became", "33:12", "a name what they called it nemesis they", "33:13", "gave it a name and so you know what", "33:15", "period orbital period that object must", "33:18", "have has got to match the extinction", "33:20", "periodicity and so it's got to be a", "33:22", "20,000 year period and so but people", "33:26", "look for it they couldn't find it and", "33:27", "then you reanalyze the the extinction", "33:30", "records and it was you you had to fudge", "33:33", "it to make it look like it was periodic", "33:35", "so basically we've abandoned the idea of", "33:37", "net of nemesis and aren't binary star", "33:40", "systems really common yeah more than", "33:41", "half the star as you see in the night", "33:42", "sky or binary or multiple systems in", "33:45", "fact the iconic image from Star Wars the", "33:47", "original Star Wars movie before they", "33:49", "numbered them I think what star wars for", "33:52", "Rooney right well yeah whatever whatever", "33:55", "that that that that desert planet that", "33:58", "Luke was on and he comes out after", "34:00", "visiting is was was a stepparent know", "34:03", "his adoptive parents were yeah where we", "34:06", "was visiting he comes out and you see a", "34:08", "double sunset so that's basically the", "34:11", "only accurate science in the entire", "34:13", "series I really enjoyed you're taking a", "34:19", "part of gravity gravity and how many", "34:22", "people got mad at me yeah you know so I", "34:24", "stopped comic-con movies I don't need to", "34:25", "piss people off", "34:27", "when I watch a movie I'm having those", "34:29", "thoughts anyway so I might as well share", "34:32", "them with people if you're interested so", "34:34", "I did just that and then people the last", "34:36", "time I did it was for Star Wars The", "34:38", "Force awakens Star Wars 7 I had a series", "34:41", "of tweets you know one of them was bb-8", "34:45", "a smooth rolling metal spherical ball", "34:48", "would have skidded uncontrollably on", "34:51", "sand", "34:52", "people got angry so much someone tweeted", "34:56", "back shut the fuck up okay that's so so", "35:00", "I said okay I'm not here to get people", "35:02", "angry I'm just here to enlighten to help", "35:04", "people enhance their movie-going", "35:06", "experience but to the extent it is not", "35:08", "accomplishing this I don't need to do it", "35:10", "I'm just saying I don't I'm an educator", "35:12", "I thought I was being nice I don't need", "35:16", "to do so I haven't tweeted about a movie", "35:17", "since then I got tweets I could watch", "35:19", "them stop you I have tweets I could post", "35:21", "about arrival please dear why I didn't", "35:23", "watch watched a little bit of a shutter", "35:25", "off okay no you got to give it a chance", "35:27", "as soon as I see a movie that starts out", "35:29", "I don't spoil or it starts out with a", "35:31", "sick kid I'm like fuck you no no in fact", "35:35", "it's very not about the kid I'm sure", "35:36", "that's what I keep it's totally not", "35:38",

no can't do it", "36:16", "tens of thousands of miles from one", "36:18", "another for goodness sakes Oh Betty I'm", "36:20", "so yeah you remember please it was like", "36:23", "15 tweets", "36:24",

weekend", "36:47", "Today Show on NBC", "36:49", "then it was talked about on NBC Nightly", "36:51", "News then my tweets were talked about a", "36:53", "Saturday Night Live's The Weekend Update",

movie got right", "40:13", "that otherwise got no science right I'll", "40:15", "be I'm the first in line to do that like", "40:18", "what Oh", "40:19", "in the movie monsters ink oh my gosh", "40:26", "those doors were four dimensional", "40:28", "portals to another that that's possible", "40:31", "well if you had four dimensions that's", "40:33", "what it would look like do you remember",

wormhole", "40:44", "that's what that is what access to the", "40:47", "fourth dimension looks like do you think", "40:49", "scientifically that's possible one day", "40:50", "yes I hope so I hope so really because", "40:53", "here's the example we've got a nice", "40:55", "broad desk we hear it that this", "40:57", "interview right so desk is two", "40:59", "dimensions it's got length and width and", "41:01", "I can start putting papers on this desk", "41:03", "and I can lay them out mosaic style and", "41:07", "then all of a sudden I have no more room", "41:09", "to put a sheet of paper if

and stack", "41:22", "things vertically so I can take a sheet", "41:24", "of paper and I can put it higher up than", "41:27", "the surface of the desk the aunt will", "41:29", "say where did it go", "41:30", "oh my gosh it disappeared", "41:32", "in some portal we know know what what is", "41:34", "that it went into the third dimension in", "41:36", "the ant bound and obviously is a three", "41:39", "dimensional thing right imagine it's it", "41:42", "only lives in two dimensions you would", "41:44", "have made that paper disappear into a", "41:46", "third dimension and it will have no clue", "41:48", "where it went because you had a portal", "41:50", "you had access to that extra dimension", "41:53", "so look at how much you can store on a", "41:56", "desk when you have access to a third", "41:59", "dimension above it vastly more than just", "42:02", "papers mosaicked out on the surface so", "42:06", "now let's up this example by a dimension", "42:09", "you're storing boxes in a room or I ran", "42:12", "out of room no you didn't let's open", "42:13", "this four dimensional door you open it", "42:16", "put the boxes through the door close the", "42:18", "door", "42:19", "box is gone they'll be awesome for", "42:22", "hoarders you uh you look around the", "42:24", "other side of the bottle that the door", "42:25", "there's nothing there right though your", "42:27", "side of the door nothing there just a", "42:29", "door that is a portal to a fourth", "42:31", "dimension that can hold vastly more", "42:34", "content then what is what you're stuck", "42:36", "storing in the three dimensional space", "42:38", "of your room now that's a concept so", "42:40", "that's a brilliant concept and even", "42:42", "though it has monsters that don't exist", "42:43", "that all

physics of four dimensional", "42:53", "portals completely accurate now the", "42:56", "concept of dimensions is work it's", "42:58", "really abstract with people I love me", "42:59", "some dimensions and it is abstract it is", "43:02", "yeah that's why you've let the math take", "43:06", "you into those higher dimensions because", "43:08", "our intuition will not will fail for us", "43:10", "right well that's where it gets weird oh", "43:12", "and when you say take the math let the", "43:14", "math take you so like when quantum", "43:15", "physicists use these legal and notepads", "43:17",

"43:25", "me maybe new then you probably", "43:29", "understand it right but I definitely", "43:31", "don't my point is what are they exactly", "43:34", "figuring out that allows them to say",

but what the way it", "43:48", "works is you try to make sense of the", "43:50", "world right and so you take some leaps", "43:53", "so some some philosophical Leafs leap", "43:56", "some mathematical leaps you say all", "43:58", "right", "43:59", "maybe all particles that manifest as an", "44:04", "electron a proton a neutron may barks", "44:07", "maybe they're just strings of energy", "44:10",

"44:20", "what are the consequences to it then how", "44:23", "many dimensions do these vibrating", "44:25", "strings require to have the properties", "44:28", "that we see in our dimensionality so so", "44:32", "the exercise of explaining what you see", "44:34", "takes you to places that you've never", "44:36", "been before and that's fine places at", "44:39", "intellectual places that you've never", "44:41", "been previously unplumbed there's", "44:42", "nothing wrong with that we've done that", "44:45", "before we that's why we know what is", "44:48", "happening in the center of the Sun have", "44:49", "we ever been there no no but we know how", "44:53", "matter behaves under pressure and", "44:55", "temperature we can do that in a", "44:57", "laboratory we've got a Sun sitting out", "44:59", "there with a surface temperature a mass", "45:00", "a certain luminosity and we say what", "45:04", "must be going on down in the core let's", "45:06", "bring our best physics a quantum physics", "45:08", "our our chemistry our nuclear physics", "45:12", "bring it all together and we have a", "45:14", "complete understanding of what's going", "45:16", "on in the center of the Sun and

that we have", "45:25", "right now or at like the atomic and", "45:27", "subatomic level we don't you can't see", "45:29", "do you realize the electron just okay so", "45:33", "I buy I mean I did a whole series of", "45:35", "this there's something called the the", "45:37", "great courses lecture series it's a yeah", "45:40", "it was a sponsor this podcast for a", "45:41", "while would really okay great courses so", "45:44", "cool", "45:45", "so I was once invited to be one of their", "45:48", "professors for the great courses and I", "45:50", "taught a very short most of them are", "45:53", "like 30 lectures it's like a whole", "45:55", "college semester so", "45:57", "and I don't have the time the energy so", "45:59", "they let me do like short bits so one of", "46:02", "them is only six parts and it's called", "46:04", "the inexplicable universe and it's six", "46:07", "parts of everything about which we know", "46:10", "nothing in this universe you might say", "46:13", "well that's a pretty easy course to give", "46:17", "okay on to the next one you might be", "46:19", "something Dark Matter we don't know stay", "46:22", "tuned so but it's interesting to learn", "46:24", "how we come to know what we don't know", "46:27", "and so it's it's an exploration of our", "46:30", "ignorance and I'm very proud of it", "46:32", "because it's it's not what you'd", "46:33", "normally find in electro series and it's", "46:35", "still it's still out there but one of", "46:37", "the things I will tell you then I'll", "46:38", "tell you now", "46:39", "the electron has no known dimension it", "46:45", "is smaller than the smallest we have", "46:47", "ever had the capacity to measure so as", "46:50", "far as we in concern it is infinitely", "46:52", "small well we have no way to even know", "46:56", "how to measure by the way how do you", "46:58", "measure something small you get", "46:59", "something smaller and find out how many", "47:01", "of those it is think about the", "47:11", "challenges at each extreme ask me how", "47:13", "big is the universe and I'll say it's as", "47:15", "big as well I got nothing what am I", "47:19", "gonna say right there's nothing as big", "47:21", "as the universe so at the biggest engine", "47:25", "at the littlest end there's not", "47:27", "something else", "47:28", "it's it doesn't work as well okay to try", "47:32", "to say what it is relative to something", "47:34", "else do you entertain the possibility", "47:35", "that the biggest send the littlest end", "47:37", "of the same thing meaning that at our", "47:39", "the smallest measurable point that", "47:41", "literally might be a whole nother", "47:43", "universe that like might be fractal it's", "47:45", "fun to think about it I mean all the way", "47:48", "down yeah it's fun to think about again", "47:50", "Finelli down like that however and", "47:52", "people by the way in in the 1920s when", "47:54", "we discovered the atom and its structure", "47:57", "and that there's an electron him quote", "47:59", "orbit around a nucleus it was that way", "48:02", "we've been there before we got planets", "48:03", "orbiting the Sun and so this this so", "48:06", "maybe it's a mini solar system may", "48:09", "it's its solar systems all the way down", "48:11", "well I'm glad you brought this up I'm", "48:13", "glad we brought this up because I wanted", "48:14", "to bring this question I almost forgot", "48:16", "there's a photograph of a brain cell and", "48:19", "side by side with a photograph of the", "48:21", "known universe and they look eerily", "48:23", "similar so you're talking about the", "48:24", "large scale structure", "48:25", "yeah the universe with large-scale", "48:27", "structuring of galaxies so I'll get to", "48:28", "that in a minute", "48:29", "okay so I'll get to that so do you ever", "48:34", "tell him just pull up his own damn", "48:35", "images so you so why that's not likely", "48:47", "okay it was an entertained idea but", "48:50", "here's why it's not likely the", "48:52", "manifestation of the laws of physics are", "48:55", "different at the atomic scale than they", "48:59", "are at the macroscopic scale they're", "49:01", "just simply different a planet can take", "49:03", "any orbit sensible for its velocity", "49:06", "around a host star an electron cannot", "49:11", "its energy levels are predetermined and", "49:14", "quantized hence the word quantum the", "49:18", "prefix quanta in quantum physics so if", "49:21", "it was a continuum of matter and energy", "49:25", "following the same laws of physics then", "49:29", "I would say then it's Sol systems all", "49:31", "the way down but the rules completely", "49:35", "change and so things can on the surface",

concept so now", "50:00", "with the neurons the network of neurons", "50:03", "and they cluster the clusters of", "50:05", "galaxies and galaxies", "50:07", "super clusters that would be on the", "50:09", "right neurons on the left that's so", "50:11", "eerie yes so so yeah they can look the", "50:15", "same but they operating under completely", "50:18", "different laws of physics", "50:21", "so in other words the laws of physics", "50:22", "that that dictate what's going on in", "50:24", "brain cells have no relationship to", "50:26", "what's going on in the universe brain", "50:28",

alpha brain", "50:53", "okay yeah so you're entering the", "50:57", "chemistry so it's chemistry what's going", "50:59", "on on the large scale structure the", "51:00", "universe is not chemistry right there's", "51:02", "some chemistry deep within but it's not", "51:05", "the chemist is not what's making that", "51:06", "pattern and because of that it becomes", "51:09", "an artistic curiosity not something that", "51:13", "has any kind of deep scientific insight", "51:15", "so it's just a fascinating similarity", "51:18", "yes it's a fascinating similarly put", "51:20", "them up together and it's fun to think", "51:22", "about it but it's not it's fun to think", "51:24", "about it artistically but not", "51:26", "scientifically no it's great if you're", "51:28", "hanging out with your friends going wow", "51:29", "man now when you're looking at subatomic", "51:35", "particles excuse me and you looking at", "51:38", "these like when they observe particles", "51:40", "in superposition where they're moving", "51:42", "and stationary at the same time or they", "51:44", "blink in and out of existence like when", "51:47", "you get down to that and I repeat the", "51:50", "the opening page of the book the", "51:53", "universe is under no obligation to make", "51:55", "sense so at that scale things that go on", "52:02", "with atoms and molecules fall outside of",

they", "52:14", "do in their day is completely foreign to", "52:17", "you so now you shrink down to that size", "52:19", "and particles are popping in and out of", "52:21", "existence they're they

"52:33", "in a visual sense well it depends", "52:36", "depending how big the phenomena is", "52:37", "otherwise you can see other things that", "52:39", "would happen that you know that are the", "52:41", "manifestations of that happening right", "52:43", "but yeah so an electron is smaller even", "52:45", "than that oh yes by how many factors no", "52:49", "no we don't even know we don't know the", "52:52", "size of an electron the concept of super", "52:54", "string theory so a super vibrating", "52:57", "string you're smaller than that yes they", "52:59", "the strings would have to be

bottom of", "53:13", "what we can observe well that's a great", "53:15", "question what is the bottom and you know", "53:17", "the word atom which was introduced by", "53:19", "the Greeks you know

when they weren't", "53:40", "waging war you could think and you know", "53:44", "what we think of as philosophy it was", "53:47", "traceable to a lot of what they were", "53:48", "doing back then and

want", "55:40", "to didn't want to over print they don't", "55:42", "want to under print if they if so they", "55:44", "get a sense of the pre-ordering because", "55:45", "you're not charged until

you put any", "58:15", "image up there you want the night sky", "58:17", "tonight it's what the sky looks like", "58:20", "from from Alpha Centauri Oh like when", "58:23", "you go to see one of those

of the past", "58:50", "would teach the people so ok so here", "58:54", "what sound looking at you okay all right", "58:55", "yes and I see you I want to know where", "58:59", "you are so I turn on the lights and I", "59:02", "say there you are all right now let's", "59:05", "make you tinier let's make you mini-me", "59:08", "okay like in the movie", "59:10", "right so now is a tiny version of you a", "59:12", "mini-me version of Joe Rogan now your", "59:15", "little I turn on what you're still there", "59:17", "okay", "59:18", "okay because if the lights are not on I", "59:20", "can't see you I don't know where you are", "59:22", "right it's that simple okay okay when", "59:27", "you start becoming the size of molecules", "59:32", "right on down to the size of an atom and", "59:35", "I

bleep I couldn't get", "61:30", "through that movie", "61:31", "I tried did you go crazy with the bad", "61:33", "science no can I tell you where I turn", "61:35", "maybe I mean well here's what people", "61:37", "don't know a lot of that is from a cult", "61:40", "the woman that I didn't know the woman", "61:42", "who is the I don't mind a cult movie you", "61:45", "know she's a channeler she's speaking as", "61:47", "a character like do you know that that", "61:50", "one blonde woman older blonde woman", "61:52", "that's in that movie okay and she speaks", "61:54", "when she speaks she's speaking as a care", "61:56", "okay I didn't know it you have to like", "61:57", "she's she's a part of like this very", "62:00", "bizarre sort of cult okay and should I", "62:03", "tell you where I tuned it out or you", "62:04", "want to finish okay so I tried to I just", "62:07", "couldn't watch it right there's a point", "62:09", "where they were talking about natives in", "62:12", "the Caribbean seeing European ships yes", "62:15", "and then they said well because they'd", "62:17", "never seen a ship before they brain", "62:21", "didn't register it as anything and then", "62:24", "it just disappeared bullshit and I'm", "62:25", "thinking no that's not half the brain", "62:27", "warehouse excuse me that's not how this", "62:29", "works okay what would happen they might", "62:32", "not know what they're looking at but", "62:33", "they'll know they're looking at", "62:34", "something and they've had ships they", "62:36", "they went from island to island that's", "62:38", "how you get from island to island is it", "62:40", "well that's a really big version yeah", "62:42", "we've never seen anything that big", "62:44", "before I don't know what it is I don't", "62:45", "know where it came from but I want to", "62:47", "find out why I want to study it I wanna", "62:49", "protect myself whatever so just because", "62:51", "you've never seen it doesn't mean you're", "62:52", "not gonna register it excuse me no it's", "62:55", "no I said no but I can't waste my got", "62:58", "other things I got to devote my brain", "62:59", "energy to instead of instead of this but", "63:02", "someone else it oh it gets better later", "63:03", "on so I said maybe I'll ba it gets more", "63:08", "confusing later on and it does a better", "63:11", "job of confusing you as to what science", "63:14", "has shown and what they haven't shown", "63:16", "now by the way just in all fairness to", "63:18", "what they think that the point they were", "63:20", "trying to make there are things that if", "63:23", "you don't know to recognize them you", "63:26", "would they would go undiscovered yes", "63:28", "okay but that doesn't mean you wouldn't", "63:30", "see them okay so for example let's say", "63:33", "you're walking and you didn't know that", "63:36", "you were walk", "63:37", "over this huge burial mound because the", "63:40", "slope was really shallow and you're just", "63:42", "walking okay well you just did you did", "63:45", "you didn't notice that okay so you need", "63:49", "a different way to see it in order to", "63:51", "know so a thumb from space from an angle", "63:53", "it measure the height whatever so there", "63:55", "are ways to miss things that's and that", "63:57", "and that happens all the time right but", "63:59", "if it's something there on the horizon", "64:02", "my gosh this is why we have eyes okay", "64:07", "now they're not the best data taking", "64:09", "devices but it's come time to tell you", "64:11", "where there's a ship or not a ship that", "64:12", "you've never seen before", "64:14", "it's a ship of cork a just so much", "64:17", "evidence of that when people discover", "64:19", "new animals yes before anything anything", "64:22", "there's no record of it whatsoever", "64:24", "people find it and they could still see", "64:25", "most scientific discoveries you", "64:27", "discovered some we've never seen before", "64:28", "Ramtha that was the woman's name that", "64:31", "was the the person that she was double", "64:33", "check that's a cool channeling name yeah", "64:35", "channeling name Ram power Chandler I'd", "64:37", "be ramped though I found that after the", "64:40", "after the the movie was done after I", "64:43", "watched it I wasn't I they got me with a", "64:45", "lot of things so I was like wow is that", "64:46", "true is that real then I started reading", "64:48", "fortunately that movie came out in the", "64:50", "2000s instead of in the 90s because if", "64:53", "it came out in the 90s we were all got", "64:54", "duped oh yeah those we wouldn't have the", "64:56", "internet all the research all the shit", "64:58", "that's wrong with it in the 2000s I", "64:59", "started researching it and then I would", "65:01", "send it to my friends like look look", "65:02", "look what fuck this came from and then", "65:04", "and then you go that's a cold yeah it's", "65:07", "a cult that lady's a cult she said she's", "65:08", "talking like she's an alien she's", "65:10", "supposed to be an alien right isn't that", "65:11", "do you see it in there anyway again I", "65:14", "don't know I don't mind people think", "65:15", "they're channelers I just don't put them", "65:17", "in charge of anything that's all well", "65:19", "it's it's nothing to find it's just that", "65:22", "you should probably say that when you", "65:24", "get going with that nobody's ever said", "65:29", "she's calls herself a ramp they think", "65:31", "it's real and genuine and since and", "65:32", "they're very sincere because they're", "65:34", "yeah they've do put themselves well that", "65:35", "whole thing what you need is is you know", "65:37", "what you need is some foundation of", "65:40", "science literacies", "65:42", "so that you can inoculate yourself", "65:44", "against those who would exploit your", "65:48", "absence of knowledge of how the science", "65:50", "for their own game well not even for", "65:52", "their own gain just YouTube videos I", "65:54", "mean someone could make a very", "65:56", "compelling YouTube video where they get", "65:57", "you convinced that oh my god dinosaurs", "65:59", "aren't real right they start playing", "66:01", "these things for you they tell they tell", "66:03", "you some pounds can pop popcorn in the", "66:05", "sea ever see that one I have seen now", "66:07", "well yeah you line up sometimes more", "66:09", "than they start popping yeah you got it", "66:10", "like Colonel someone yeah that can't", "66:13", "really have no no imagine it could Jesus", "66:16", "Christ look what are we doing with these", "66:18", "folks but there's there's a ton of those", "66:20", "out there where people see that's it's", "66:22", "one of the problems with with a lack of", "66:25", "dialogue with someone who just has one", "66:27", "narrative like you sit down you edit", "66:30", "something and you just talk you know", "66:32", "it's it's it's very similar to like even", "66:34", "if you write a blog I mean that's one", "66:35", "thing if you're writing a blog like say", "66:36", "if you're an expert in electronics you", "66:38", "read a blog about how a television works", "66:40", "but if you're just a person and you", "66:42", "don't really understand what you're", "66:44", "talking about

"67:08", "one of the great challenges in life is", "67:12", "knowing enough to think you're right but", "67:17", "not enough to know you're wrong", "67:20", "yeah well that is a big problem with a", "67:21", "lot of people that watch these YouTube", "67:23", "videos that's what it is they say oh", "67:24", "this is right oh my gosh but they don't", "67:26", "know enough to know why it's wrong well", "67:27", "this is what I want to talk to you about", "67:28", "Oh what is it about people that there's", "67:31", "this this this is this very compelling", "67:33", "need to find something out that other", "67:36", "people don't know like the world is flat", "67:39", "like dinosaurs aren't real like that", "67:41", "kind of stuff is very compelling to", "67:43", "people so what I do in those cases in", "67:45", "the in the a flea yeah so what I do is I", "67:49", "would say instead of debating them and", "67:52", "some of some of your listeners are", "67:54", "listening to this right now and what all", "67:56", "I would do is say what is your best", "68:00", "single bit of evidence", "68:02", "for what you're claiming and what would", "68:07", "it take to show that you're wrong", "68:09", "mmm all right well let's go to a simple", "68:12", "one so that's what I would ask okay and", "68:14", "I've done this exercise and it doesn't", "68:18", "work you know why why because there was", "68:20", "a guy who didn't believe we went to the", "68:21", "moon", "68:21", "we spent a third of our time in our last", "68:23", "session goes there says if someone I", "68:26", "know who doesn't believe he went to the", "68:27", "moon where let me just say he's", "68:28", "skeptical so I said what kind of", "68:31", "evidence would convince you he said", "68:34", "images of

says", "69:12", "well NASA could have faked that well I'm", "69:16", "done with you we have no more to talk", "69:18", "about because he's not ready to be", "69:22", "convinced well that's a weird because we", "69:23", "gave him the evidence he asked for exact", "69:26", "of that would convince him and it did", "69:29", "not convince him that's a so we have no", "69:32", "other conversation

able", "73:46", "to see Manhattan at all okay and it", "73:52", "depends on the height that you're", "73:53", "viewing well thank you well so so you do", "73:56", "the math and it turns out Manhattan the", "73:58", "island would not be visible at all", "74:00", "that's true but any building taller than", "74:04", "15 stories would rise up above the", "74:07", "curvature of the earth and you will see", "74:08", "it and if you look at the photo you see", "74:10", "the tall buildings rising above 15", "74:13", "stories it's exactly what the correct", "74:15", "formula shows and not his formula

think a mile I have to", "74:40", "ask how much curvature of the earth you", "74:42", "get", "74:43", "after miles we also didn't drop question", "74:45", "you get dropped in Kirby gravity drop", "74:47", "yes and then curve yeah so both of those", "74:49", "yeah well this is it good its here's a", "74:52", "thing to say someone if you have a", "74:54", "bullet in your hand and you shoot a gun", "74:57", "which bullocks faster right they yeah", "75:01", "they generally they get the wrong answer", "75:01", "to that yeah drop at the exact same rate", "75:03", "they'll hit the ground at the same exact", "75:05", "same time and that that blows people's", "75:07", "minds they can't believe that but you do", "75:09", "that in physics 101 you know it's it's", "75:12", "an expected

that's where the fundamental", "75:21", "operations of nature are to be found", "75:23", "okay physical universe are to be found", "75:25", "so what you have is you have a gun at", "75:28", "one side it's like a thing that shoots", "75:30", "out a projectile I don't call it a gun", "75:32", "at one side of the stage and then you", "75:34", "have like a little stuffed animal at the", "75:36",

moves", "75:55", "horizontally but also falls because", "75:58", "gravity is pulling them both and you", "76:00", "watch the projectile curve down you", "76:03", "watch the stuffed animal curve down and", "76:04", "it hits the stuffed animal every single", "76:07", "time the only factor that would change", "76:09", "that would be if you put wings on the", "76:11", "bullet and was dealing with the wind", "76:14", "yeah when wind would affect it yeah do", "76:17", "they have bullets with wings I haven't", "76:18", "seen them no they don't okay no but if", "76:20", "they did yeah you know if like you shot", "76:23", "the bullet I saw that on some James Bond", "76:28", "movie I probably yeah I'm sure it's it's", "76:32", "just gotta be frustrating for you when", "76:34", "these things come back around like there", "76:36", "was no flatter Theory when I was in high", "76:38", "school so there are other things though", "76:40", "think about it when you're in high", "76:41", "school there was much more astrology", "76:43", "going on", "76:44", "oh yeah the President Reagan let's talk", "76:45", "about that Nancy Reagan has an", "76:47", "astrologer", "76:49", "so today you don't see much of it unless", "76:53", "you talk to Steve Maxwell well but it's", "76:54", "still there", "76:55", "it's just not", "76:56", "it's not manifesting in public policy", "76:59", "some people believe in a deeply I agree", "77:01", "but it's not up there in public policy", "77:03", "that's when I said okay well we're the", "77:04", "Nancy Reagan was really the only one", "77:06", "that made it one publisher then but at", "77:08", "the bar - do you hear people saying if", "77:26", "you're a Taurus we should just stop I", "77:28", "miss that I misled myself I thought it", "77:30", "was fading oh but just but Nancy Reagan", "77:33", "was the big proponent it's nonsense", "77:36", "astrology now it's not like someone who", "77:37", "really understands astrological charts", "77:39", "and can plot it in the moons and", "77:41", "retrograde and you were born and you", "77:43", "know Celsius was rising and all that", "77:45", "crazy crap that they tried I don't know", "77:47", "what their I was on a talk show with in", "77:49", "astrology", "77:49", "a real one apparently yes she's real she", "77:55", "says she's real okay and I trust her", "77:59", "because she talks about how fake other", "78:01", "astrologers are don't trust her and she", "78:07", "was saying that the Kennedys all died", "78:10", "during a lunar eclipse Oh scary and you", "78:15", "know that this is a very checkable", "78:16", "statement she just says this and", "78:18", "everyone's listening and believing and", "78:19", "Wow that's that can't be by accident and", "78:21", "well I don't know when other Kennedys", "78:23", "died but I know when Jack Kennedy died", "78:26", "and there was November 22nd 1963 so I so", "78:30", "I don't need to know if there's an", "78:32", "eclipse then I just need to know what", "78:33", "phase the moon is in right because you", "78:35", "can only have a lunar eclipse when the", "78:36", "moon is full so the moon was nowhere", "78:38", "near fall it was like two weeks away", "78:40", "from full even if it wasn't eclipse", "78:42", "it didn't happen during eclipse is my", "78:45", "point right okay so of course because it", "78:49", "was daylight well no no you can have a", "78:51", "lunar eclipse at any time okay", "78:56", "Riu dark it's just not for you it would", "78:58", "be for your world right right", "79:00", "don't be so it's some century in fact", "79:05", "when there's a lunar eclipse anyone on", "79:07", "the side of the earth that sees the moon", "79:08", "will see the lunar", "79:10", "so the so by the way lunar eclipses you", "79:13", "get several per year by the way partial", "79:16", "eclipses as a minimum and every couple", "79:18", "years there's a full lunar eclipses so", "79:21", "these are not rare things to start", "79:23", "they're not rare okay so I said you know", "79:26", "he was shot when the I forgot what muna", "79:28", "was a first quarter moon and she said oh", "79:31", "well this counts if they're anywhere", "79:34", "within two weeks on either side of the", "79:37", "eclipse what that's a month that's a", "79:39", "month it's I said let me just shut up", "79:43", "here and let her keep it was a what is", "79:44", "sharing the time it was a Pharrell had a", "79:47", "talk show we were booked so and he'd", "79:49", "like science by the way and he he want a", "79:51", "cert at the at they at the the Academy", "79:55", "Award group photo", "79:57", "so I got to give him some props for that", "79:59", "but so but so I just said I have nothing", "80:02", "more to say here hence my arguing with", "80:05", "her lasted less than five minutes now", "80:07", "what are they when when they're trying", "80:09", "to decide like what your personality", "80:10", "would be and what you you know hike what", "80:13", "you can dictate from your birth date and", "80:16", "what time you were born what what are", "80:18", "they exactly trying to connect so I I", "80:22", "had a deeper awareness of this recently", "80:25", "when I learned that people take the", "80:30", "names of things very seriously okay the", "80:35", "names mean things to people regardless", "80:39", "of what the thing actually is okay okay", "80:44", "yeah so what might we mean by this so", "80:48", "let's like astrophysically i say we have", "80:50", "this thing called dark matter we don't", "80:51", "know what it is well it's got to be some", "80:53", "kind of matter no no it shouldn't be", "80:57", "called dark matter it should be call", "80:59", "Fred alright with no it shouldn't lead", "81:03", "you to think anything about it because", "81:05", "we do not know what it is we should", "81:08", "really call it dark gravity it is it is", "81:11", "gravity that we have measured we don't", "81:13", "know what's causing the gravity just", "81:14", "call it dark matter implies you think", "81:16", "it's matter some people do but we don't", "81:19", "know so explain to me what what is this", "81:23", "based on like when you say dark matter", "81:25", "what is it based on it's I'd like to", "81:28", "just call it Fred okay let's call it", "81:29", "Fred and I'm saying we don't know what", "81:30", "it is right how is gravity of this stuff", "81:34", "okay it's out there it's six times the", "81:36", "gravity of stuff that's ordinary matter", "81:39", "we don't know where it's coming from", "81:41", "we don't know the source we don't know", "81:42", "the art is it a parallel universe is it", "81:44", "we don't know and how are we measuring", "81:45", "it by its effect on the motions of", "81:48", "objects so a certain strength of gravity", "81:52", "will force you to move at a given speed", "81:53", "as you near it and as you pull away and", "81:56", "we see this in galaxies galaxy clusters", "82:00", "binary galaxies more measured entire", "82:03", "galaxies that are made completely out of", "82:05", "this Fred a month at least 80% of the", "82:10", "force of gravity manifested in these", "82:12", "galaxies is Fred yes and that's why are", "82:18", "they calling it dark matter", "82:19", "they shouldn't in my opinion you call", "82:20", "dark gravity because that's literally", "82:22", "what it is so it's gravity that cannot", "82:24", "be measured or gravity that's not", "82:25", "gravity a pletely understood it's not", "82:27", "understood correct so it's it's", "82:28", "mysterious gravity we're completely", "82:30", "measured to do we measure it you can't", "82:32", "narrow down what measure gravity", "82:34", "precisely right okay so you measure it", "82:36", "but you can't so my talking origin", "82:38", "because some we don't know what it is", "82:40", "right", "82:41", "my point is because someone called it", "82:43", "dark matter", "82:44", "it has swayed everybody into thinking", "82:47", "that it is a matter of some kind", "82:50", "it has constrained people's thoughts", "82:54", "about how to think about this problem", "82:56", "okay so now the ancients looked up and", "82:59", "they saw these stars and they put their", "83:04", "culture on the sky so they're centaurs", "83:08", "there's there's you know where the", "83:15", "center so Center Archer so it's", "83:17", "Sagittarius we have a Ryan the hunter we", "83:19", "have Taurus so we have sea serpents we", "83:21", "have rivers we have stuff that mattered", "83:24", "to people back then okay we have an", "83:27", "Aquarius what is it was the water-bearer", "83:31", "oh the water-bearer", "83:32", "that must mean that when the Sun is in", "83:35", "Aquarius", "83:36", "it's gonna rain more on earth why", "83:39", "because the ancients called it the", "83:42", "water-bearer", "83:43", "ah okay and all of a sudden the name", "83:47", "reigns supreme over the fact that it is", "83:52", "a random set of stars widely separated", "83:55", "in space that don't even look like", "83:58", "people holding a pitcher of water of the", "84:02", "88 constellations about six of them look", "84:05", "like what you're told they're supposed", "84:07", "to look like the rest require opium", "84:09", "induced imagination to establish what", "84:13", "they are so they all have names then you", "84:18", "go to the astrologers tables and they", "84:21", "say oh this is the raine sign or this is", "84:23", "a dry drought sign and there you take", "84:26", "the names of things and those names or", "84:28", "what they interpret based on where the", "84:30", "moon is the Sun is where the planets are", "84:32", "and all whatever the angle", "84:34", "configurations there are and each angle", "84:37", "has a certain latitude over which", "84:39", "they'll count it as a hit rather than as", "84:42", "a miss and so this gives extraordinary", "84:46", "capacity of the astrologer to tell you", "84:49", "what's going on in your life so it's", "84:53", "bullshit but they did have this real", "85:01", "fascinating connection with these", "85:05", "certain constellations and all of the", "85:07", "different things that they thought were", "85:08", "attached these certain constellation", "85:10", "notes you know would be like it'll be", "85:11", "like a geologist going up to the border", "85:14", "of Colorado trying to understand the", "85:16", "shape as a geologist hmm it's it's it's", "85:20", "an arbitrary shape hmm Colorado is a", "85:23", "square on a curved surface it's amazing", "85:25", "how much confirmation bias is attached", "85:27", "to Australia by a river", "85:28", "byah yeah that's right so you know wiki", "85:31", "has a great website on cognitive bias", "85:36", "hmm and there's like 20 or so well known", "85:41", "by every person it should be this should", "85:44", "be a course called cognitive bias 101", "85:47", "not forget college every high school", "85:50", "of course cognitive bias and the entire", "85:52", "course should be about all the ways we", "85:54", "fool ourselves don't you think that", "85:56", "little Sciences so I've tweeted this to", "85:59", "science the only point of the scientific", "86:04", "method is to make sure you are not", "86:08", "fooled into

"say because of look at this evidence do", "90:58", "you know how to read evidence by the way", "90:59", "and look at this evidence pyramid and", "91:03", "this is why we conclude overwhelmingly",

scientists", "91:22", "don't dig out their head up their ass", "91:23", "right yeah well I think also would be", "91:29", "really beneficial to teach people how to", "91:31", "manage perspective and how to look at", "91:34", "you know look at life in a way that's", "91:36", "gonna be beneficial to you but we're not", "91:38", "really giving more to manage the mind", "91:40", "like philosophy and

yeah and the causes and", "91:53", "effects and consequences there's not", "91:55", "enough of that either no I mean they're", "91:57", "relying on that to happen at home but", "91:58", "not all homes are intact right in fact", "92:01", "perhaps most are broken homes or", "92:03", "separated homes and so I I think the", "92:06", "school systems school needs to be", "92:09", "rethought and I'm

I'm an educator I will I", "93:16", "will teach you the causes and effects of", "93:19", "what science is knowing what science is", "93:22", "and how and why it works which is why", "93:23", "it's critical that you continue to", "93:24", "criticize science fiction movies it's", "93:26", "very important don't you back off now we", "93:29", "need use a lot of people that wouldn't", "93:30", "know that that Chinese space station is", "93:32", "known and that her hair would be moving", "93:36", "all over the place there would be", "93:37", "everywhere yeah well my favorite one is", "93:39", "remember when he's at the end of a", "93:40", "tether and she's drawn to save him but", "93:43", "she doesn't have an oxygen to do it so", "93:45", "he lets go of the tether and that way", "93:48", "she can't save him before she can save", "93:50", "herself right and he and then he flies", "93:53", "away it's like no they're like floating", "93:56", "in space yeah let's go to the tether it", "94:00", "just stays there in his hand yeah", "94:02", "doesn't he would be right there he would", "94:03", "be right there nothing let's go nothing", "94:05", "happens wooden be like a bungee cord now", "94:06", "if he if she was swinging him in circles", "94:08", "and he like oh yeah he'd fly off at a", "94:10", "tangent but that's not what was", "94:12", "happening right and nor were they", "94:13", "rotating I would check the what they", "94:16", "were relative to earth below there was", "94:17", "not what was going on so then you know", "94:20", "she could have just give it a slight tug", "94:21", "and then he would have drifted towards", "94:23", "her that could have even been a little", "94:24", "romance it's a little baby tug we talked", "94:27", "would do it they would slowly drop the", "94:29", "helmets would hit you know and then the", "94:33", "helmets break and then there'd be", "94:34", "freezing it up instantly right you'd", "94:37", "suffocate that too and then freeze to", "94:39", "death", "94:40", "right what movie nailed that there was", "94:42", "one movie with the space you know they", "94:44", "overdid it", "94:44", "well there was people want you to like", "94:48", "explode in space yeah no no I mean well", "94:51", "you want you to free solid to instantly", "94:53", "yeah right no just know there's and even", "94:55", "in was an Armageddon where the Sun rose", "94:58", "over this over the over the comet and he", "95:02", "didn't have his visor down and he was", "95:03", "blinded by the Sun it's like the same", "95:06", "Sun in our daytime sky the atmosphere", "95:09", "doesn't protect you in any of the", "95:11", "Earth's atmosphere it takes out you know", "95:13", "the few percent that's right oh yeah a", "95:16", "few percent boy in the middle say just", "95:18", "one day light at the top of the sky a", "95:20", "few percent now he'll get more UV he'll", "95:23", "get more UV that's important get a", "95:25", "little brown yep but yep death in space", "95:31", "is nowhere near as spectacular as movies", "95:33", "would have you think yeah they make it", "95:35", "seem like if you take that a helmet off", "95:37", "you just have immediately freeze up yeah", "95:38", "yeah no no I mean you can go into very", "95:40", "what happens is there's nothing making", "95:43", "you cold other than you radiating heat", "95:47", "from your skin so you only get as cold", "95:49", "as quickly as you can radiate away heat", "95:52", "that's all", "95:53", "so take quite a while oh yeah no no air", "95:56", "so you'd suffocate quicker yeah you'd", "95:58", "suffocate oh yeah you some Kate long", "95:59", "before you saw anything anything like", "96:02", "that happen so so just think about", "96:03", "there's nothing touching you that's", "96:06", "making you cold it has to wait for you", "96:08", "to radiate away mmm that's what's", "96:11", "happening okay and so that so yeah", "96:15", "you'll feel very cold very quickly but", "96:17", "you're not gonna die from that fast", "96:19", "now when Stephen Hawking oh by the way", "96:21", "you also have dissolved gases in your", "96:22", "body which will try to come because in", "96:25", "in in the vacuum of space you don't have", "96:28", "the air pressure tamping down the", "96:30", "dissolve gas so you take away the air", "96:32", "pressure then the dissolved gases will", "96:34", "begin to bubble out of your blood no", "96:37", "there's the same problem with when you", "96:38", "have the bends ah when you come up from", "96:40", "low altitude right and you go to lesser", "96:43", "pressure around you employees again nice", "96:44", "so you want to do that slowly so that", "96:46", "it's a very slow thing but the hazards", "96:49", "of but why would you", "96:52", "be butt naked in space I'm you're gonna", "96:54", "have a space suit on well I just want to", "96:55", "prove to everybody that you do it so", "96:57", "like well they did in 2001 a Space", "96:59", "Odyssey they basically did it right the", "97:01", "guy without his helmet went through the", "97:02", "airlock I just held his breath oh okay", "97:05", "yeah yeah that's what we do oh well that", "97:07", "that's way more reasonable well because", "97:09", "it was a reasonable movie there was a", "97:12", "real adviser Stanley Kubrick well he was", "97:15", "a really interesting guy - cuz he was a", "97:16", "mathematician Stanley I didn't know that", "97:18", "about but I knew he cared about yeah", "97:20", "that level of detail", "97:21", "he's to do complex math and for fun so", "97:23", "there's a there's a there's a failed bit", "97:25", "of physics and 2001 you want oh yeah", "97:27", "yeah one day I'll talk about my pencil", "97:28", "it's nutso huh then the monolith which", "97:32", "was it no no so remember when he's he's", "97:35", "on one of the the moon crafts and he's", "97:37", "orbiting the moon and they give him food", "97:39", "alright and there's a tray of nasty food", "97:42", "obviously it's like astronaut food", "97:43", "remember this is 1968 so everything here", "97:46", "is a is a visual taste of the future so", "97:52", "he has another packet where he extends a", "97:55", "straw from that plastic packet okay oh", "97:58", "there he is", "97:59", "excellent and you're getting the good", "98:00", "photo you're good your boy is good right", "98:02", "here okay yeah there is", "98:04", "so he sucks up the straw right and this", "98:07", "isn't zero-g so stuff is floating but he", "98:08", "sucked up the straw then he goes to", "98:10", "another straw and the liquid and the", "98:12", "straw goes back down that's gravity yeah", "98:18", "he totally fucked them no so that one", "98:22", "obviously he can't get everything right", "98:24", "but it's fun to notice the things he", "98:26", "couldn't get right we didn't think to", "98:28", "get right so to me it's a celebration", "98:29", "here's another one okay the rotation", "98:32", "rate of the space station I calculated", "98:36", "that and I did calculated what g-force", "98:40", "would you have on the outer perimeter of", "98:42", "the space station in 2001 and I did the", "98:46", "math and I forgot the exact numbers", "98:47", "something like between 2 and 3 G's oh", "98:50", "and I said it's why would you do that", "98:52", "that's stupid you wouldn't do that and I", "98:54", "realized if they rotated it at the rate", "98:57", "that would give you 1 G you'd be way too", "98:59", "slow to make an interesting scene", "99:03", "as I gave it to him as I'll give you 3", "99:05", "G's because the Strauss waltz as the", "99:08", "thing turns and the space shuttle that's", "99:10", "approaching it matches its rotation rate", "99:13", "with the opening in the center of the", "99:15", "space station this whole ballet this", "99:19", "entire ballet wow that's cool again", "99:21", "happens at a stately but real pace ok", "99:25", "but that pace gives them a 3G 3GS of", "99:28", "gravity so it's 3x the correct pace the", "99:31", "correct pace maybe been two and a half", "99:33", "but I forgot the number but it's it's", "99:35", "multiples too high so days much soon as", "99:38", "I let him do it it's it's so I'm not", "99:40", "gonna so I'm fine that's that's artistic", "99:42", "license that's Mark Twain II and license", "99:44", "where he says first get your facts", "99:46", "straight then distort them at your", "99:48", "leisure", "99:49", "that is what I'm holding artists to so", "99:52", "now when you're looking at a space", "99:55", "station like they're in zero-gravity", "99:56", "when they're in space station know they", "99:59", "are in 1g on the edge of the space", "100:01", "station on the edge yeah on the turning", "100:03", "edge yeah that's a lot I mean that thing", "100:05", "so our space yes", "100:09", "oh so it's zero-g yes right now it's but", "100:12", "it is possibie cuz it is in freefall", "100:15", "towards Earth so it's constantly in", "100:18", "freefall but it's just going around the", "100:19", "yeah it's in freefall towards Earth but", "100:21", "it's going sideways so fast that the", "100:24", "amount that it has fallen equals", "100:27", "precisely the spin of the curvature of", "100:29", "the earth uh-huh is that more proof that", "100:32", "the earth is round if you've had physics", "100:35", "101 yes but is it possible sorry", "100:39", "gravity yeah in a space station only if", "100:41", "you rotate it along zero 10 it's not", "100:42", "gravity it's a similar system but", "100:45", "according to Einstein they're", "100:46", "indistinguishable from one another so", "100:47", "you can do it so there it is possible to", "100:49", "do something where you can send people", "100:51", "into deep space and generate gravity", "100:54", "through some station or two at least two", "100:56", "ways one of them you just rotate it and", "100:57", "all the good sci-fi movies have rotating", "101:01", "sections of a Space Station right right", "101:03", "and there's some that have rotating", "101:05", "opposite ways so that they can submit up", "101:07", "against one another right and so there's", "101:10", "some clever ideas out there with space", "101:12", "stations of the future", "101:14", "for long voyages we use I had commander", "101:16", "Hadfield on the podcast cool came back", "101:19", "from space and was talking about the", "101:21", "excruciating difficulty he had", "101:24", "readjusting to gravity after being in a", "101:26", "zero gravity environment for so long", "101:28", "he's just showing off because he's like", "101:29", "setting records for be sure yeah I", "101:34", "couldn't I couldn't handle life with you", "101:36", "lowly earth people he was talking about", "101:39", "his body like it took like over a year", "101:41", "before his bone density came back and", "101:43", "well this is it partly addressed in the", "101:46", "film the the the Martian kid he's born", "101:51", "on Mars comes to earth which ones going", "101:54", "on Mars yeah the kid born on Mars I'm", "101:56", "get you gotta research this like now", "101:58", "yeah what's the name of the movie its", "102:00", "recent yeah yeah oh this the space", "102:03", "between us oh what the hell is that you", "102:05", "got to get out more dude I do yeah", "102:07", "that's so this is a Martian colony where", "102:09", "the first community who's what movies", "102:12", "this this came out of come on months ago", "102:14", "really oh my gosh oh yeah", "102:16", "ma'am so there's this 19 so that's the", "102:18", "Martian colony and one of the female", "102:21", "astronauts they send that one there", "102:24", "happens to be they learn is pregnant and", "102:27", "they can't bring her back and so they", "102:29", "she gives birth on Mars the first person", "102:31", "who was ever born on Mars and then they", "102:37", "then they keep it a secret and then he", "102:39", "comes back as a teenager that falls in", "102:41", "love see there's the fetus so so anyhow", "102:45", "he has a hard time on earth because his", "102:47", "heart developed in Martian gravity which", "102:50", "is only 38% earth gravity oh wow then on", "102:53", "earth he just couldn't they had to you", "102:55", "know figure out what to do with him Wow", "102:57", "yeah that's on Mars the kid was born on", "103:00", "Mars okay yeah don't spoil alert me", "103:02", "Jamie yeah that's why yeah yeah yeah", "103:05", "yeah so well we're generating gravity", "103:09", "yes so one way to rotate it up another", "103:11", "way is if you're headed somewhere right", "103:12", "I just have a huge fuel tank and just", "103:16", "always run your rockets ah solar force", "103:20", "is always a g-force if you should sell", "103:22", "accelerated 1g right towards a", "103:25", "destination then you'll always have", "103:27", "feeling gravity", "103:28", "and you'll get there awesomely fast but", "103:31", "you would have to have so much fuel or", "103:32", "on something well you knew you filling", "103:35", "stations on route this sort of the end", "103:36", "if you do this you accelerate 1g halfway", "103:39", "there then you turn the spaceship around", "103:42", "then you decelerate at 1g for the other", "103:45", "half of the trip so that when you get", "103:46", "there you're not whizzing past it in a", "103:48", "flyby okay then we have 1g the whole", "103:51", "trip that's how you would do that Wow so", "103:54", "the momentum when you'd precisely do", "103:57", "somebody there at 1g oh my gosh you hit", "103:59", "near the speed of light very quickly", "104:01", "whoa oh my I mean I forgot what is it in", "104:04", "a I have to calculate it but it's it's", "104:07", "the acceleration of gravity if you", "104:10", "actually move that fast that's that's", "104:13", "head snapping now would they have to", "104:15", "have some sort of a crazy propulsion", "104:17", "system in order to do something along", "104:18", "those lines", "104:19", "how fast were 1g get you there yes yes", "104:25", "so Wow 1g would take 1 plus the distance", "104:30", "in lightyears Proxima Centauri 4.2", "104:33", "light-years for example would take 5", "104:34", "point 2 years so the distance in", "104:36", "lightyears plus a year so that's that's", "104:39", "that's so that gets you basically 20-25", "104:43", "percent the speed of light what happens", "104:44", "if you just run into stuff on the way", "104:46", "like there's a lot of stuff out there", "104:47", "right yes it's not a giant issue and", "104:49", "getting to Mars well the space is", "104:50", "actually quite empty but if you do hit", "104:53", "something that's the end of everything", "104:54", "so it's it's a low risk high consequence", "104:57", "thing then you gotta you got to put in", "105:00", "play know how much of a risk is the", "105:02", "space junk that we've left in the", "105:04", "environment we were started well", "105:05", "freaking out about how many S's are up", "105:07", "there I guess so there's countless", "105:08", "thousands of bits of space junk from", "105:11", "chips of paint that fell off of the base", "105:14", "so bolts and nails and retro right and", "105:17", "boosters yeah that's all it's all up", "105:19", "there and I'm and I'm wondering whether", "105:21", "we haven't been visited by aliens yet", "105:22", "because I saw the space junk orbiting", "105:24", "Earth and said forget that I'm gonna", "105:26", "submit it to some other planet", "105:28", "I'm gonna risk my life since the", "105:30", "short-sighted approach to space travel", "105:32", "so the NASA orbital debris office", "105:35", "website you can actually see the debris", "105:38", "that NASA's tracking basic almost in", "105:40", "real time it's", "105:41", "it'll show serious and it's it's like a", "105:43", "beehive around the earth so you got yeah", "105:48", "there it is okay that's the debris", "105:50", "around the earth that asteroid that NASA", "105:53", "tracks and there's a failed Japanese", "105:55", "experiment to try to in that outer ring", "105:57", "that you see that's the the altitude of", "106:00", "geosynchronous satellites and that inner", "106:03", "enough that should be there should be a", "106:05", "video of that just fine go to the bottom", "106:08", "right go to bottom right right there", "106:10", "click on that play that video it's not a", "106:13", "video why isn't that a video I'm sure", "106:15", "there is a video somewhere yeah there's", "106:17", "a video on that site so you can just see", "106:21", "the movement of these pieces and it's so", "106:24", "launch windows have to know when to not", "106:26", "hit stuff so so when you've launched", "106:28", "whoo it's not just is everything aligned", "106:30", "right is what K will you successfully", "106:33", "get past the debris and there was a", "106:36", "Japanese they had an experiment to try", "106:39", "to capture it with nets there was a", "106:41", "recent mole yeah so didn't work yeah so", "106:46", "the problem is the low orbit stuff will", "106:49", "eventually fall in and burn up the", "106:51", "higher court except will never go away", "106:53", "there's nothing to destroy it and so", "106:56", "they can't capture that stuff well you", "106:58", "need a very clever this this stuff is", "107:00", "moving 18,000 miles an hour so what's", "107:03", "your net what just what are you doing go", "107:10", "higher res on that sure if there's a", "107:13", "high no there's a high rest oh god", "107:16", "that's 1080 no it's not from NASA's", "107:19", "YouTube there okay somebody else but", "107:21",

1950s Sputnik oh", "107:52", "yeah", "107:53", "1957 that was the first satellite first", "107:55", "anything yeah first anything in orbit Oh", "107:57", "God and in that short amount of time no", "108:01", "that's crazy", "108:02", "yeah it's like it's like a dumpster 60", "108:06", "years planetary don't ruin the whole", "108:07", "thing ruin the whole thing they've had", "108:09", "it for billions of years 60 years they", "108:11", "filled it up with junk that's oh my god", "108:15", "that's terrifying it yeah that's going", "108:17", "around the earth oh my god all of that", "108:19",

2003 China", "108:35", "destroyed one of its own satellites yeah", "108:39", "what was that about orbit I remember", "108:40", "someone yeah yeah and they basically did", "108:44", "a kinetic kill on

system with a", "109:08", "warhead and I put some bomb device in", "109:11", "the warhead and you can calculate how", "109:12", "much energy that is then I send it and", "109:15", "it hits and it blow something up but", "109:17", "suppose I send this thing really really", "109:18", "fast really really really fast I can", "109:23", "calculate how much kinetic energy this", "109:24", "thing has there

put in the warhead ah", "109:37", "like shoemaker-levy well that's for", "109:40", "example yeah no no I give you a", "109:42", "terrestrial example okay it's so it's", "109:45", "what we call a high-speed collision this", "109:48", "is more than you bargained for in this", "109:49", "in our time together but I will tell you", "109:50", "nowaday ready perfect the argument", "109:54", "for the longest time that the craters on", "109:56", "the moon were calderas from volcanoes", "110:00", "and not asteroid impacts the geologists", "110:05", "argue strenuously these can't be", "110:07", "asteroid impacts they've got to be", "110:09", "calderas these thousand craters on the", "110:12", "moon oh why because every one is a", "110:15", "perfect circle and if asteroids are", "110:20", "coming from space they would come from", "110:22", "all angles and if you come in at a", "110:24", "shallow angle you get an oval and even", "110:27", "shallower be more oval so you'd have a", "110:29", "whole range of circles and ovals and", "110:32", "ellipses and you don't see that they", "110:34", "must be calderas it was not sitting out", "110:37", "there it's a volcano just create a", "110:40", "volcanic crater that's a Yellowstone", "110:42", "yeah yeah yeah it's a vault it's a", "110:43", "volcanic crater that's all and it's a", "110:47", "little more poetic a caldera yeah but", "110:49", "it's a it's a crater left by a volcano", "110:51", "that has exploded like the boom was so", "110:54", "big the mountains gone and now it's just", "110:56", "a big hole", "110:56", "or at the top of the mountain there's a", "110:58", "crater at the top of the mountain like", "110:59", "crater lake that's that's a round hole", "111:02", "in the top of a mountain was that once a", "111:05", "volcano I don't know but it's a hole", "111:06", "okay so in the 1970s we were able to do", "111:11", "calculations with high speed computers", "111:13", "with good computers and what we found", "111:15", "was if the object is moving faster if", "111:23", "the kinetic energy of the object is", "111:26", "higher then the energy that's holding", "111:30", "the thing together ooh okay", "111:34", "so what's holding together a rock the", "111:37", "chemical connections of the silicon and", "111:40", "the oxygen and everything that they are", "111:42", "an all everything is making the rock", "111:43", "that's holding it together you can", "111:45", "calculate how much energy is holding it", "111:47", "together and if it's going 45,000 write", "111:49", "that write down that number now I send", "111:52", "in the asteroid with a kinetic energy", "111:55", "higher than the energy that's holding it", "111:58", "together on impact it explodes oh", "112:02", "because all that energy goes back into", "112:06", "the rock because", "112:07", "thing isn't moving anymore we did the", "112:09", "kinetic energy go it digs a crater", "112:11", "number one by virtue of putting all that", "112:15", "energy back into the stone and that", "112:19", "explodes it so on impact even at an", "112:22", "angle it is a singular point explosion", "112:24", "and that's why every single crater is a", "112:26", "perfect circle we call that a high-speed", "112:28", "impact where the speed is greater the", "112:32", "energy of the speed is greater than the", "112:34", "energy that's holding it together now", "112:36", "you have experience in this okay have", "112:41", "you ever thrown us do this next oh you", "112:43", "think we're in California sorry", "112:44", "snowballs snowballs take us snow cut a", "112:46", "big bear they have to take a smoke there", "112:48", "and face oh it's a barn wall and throw", "112:52", "the snowball at it and it'll make a", "112:54", "little circular mark on it now change", "112:57", "your angle to the wall and throw the", "113:00", "snowball again it'll still make a a", "113:01", "small round mark and it'll keep doing it", "113:04", "you know why because the speed with", "113:07", "which you threw the snowball that energy", "113:09", "is greater than the energy that's", "113:11", "holding the snowball together because", "113:12", "hardly energy hardly any energy is", "113:15", "holding a snowball together it's just", "113:18", "loosely packed snow so when you do it", "113:21", "against the wall you see the snowball", "113:23", "completely disappear in a in a mini", "113:26", "snowball explosion if you will so this", "113:29", "works for any comparison of projectile", "113:33", "speed and what we call the binding", "113:35", "energy of the object itself this is why", "113:37", "the intercontinental ballistic missiles", "113:39", "never carried conventional warheads", "113:42", "because their speed coming out of this", "113:46", "of space because they leave the", "113:48", "atmosphere go from one continent to the", "113:49", "other and then they fall out of the sky", "113:51", "that speed gives them more kinetic", "113:54", "energy than any conventional warhead", "113:55", "would have had whoa but then we figured", "113:58", "out how to make small nuclear warheads", "113:59", "the nukes now you talk and energy the", "114:05", "kinetic energy of the ICBM is not higher", "114:08", "than the nuclear warhead that we now put", "114:10", "in that's why all ICBMs are nukes Wow", "114:14", "the v2 rocket basically didn't need an", "114:17", "explosive warhead in its tip they came", "114:21", "out of the sky going five miles per", "114:23", "second there was none of this that", "114:26", "implies you're hearing the thing the it", "114:28", "is coming in supersonically Wow you're", "114:31", "sitting there at a cocktail table on a", "114:33", "block and then the block is gone is", "114:34", "obliterated in the next instant you", "114:36", "didn't even know you didn't even know to", "114:37", "look up Wow", "114:39", "so that's the end and they add an", "114:41", "explosive anyway but they'd they", "114:43", "probably didn't need to now to go back", "114:45", "to shoemaker-levy that was a comment", "114:47", "that slammed into jupiter no good", "114:48", "Jupiter is a gas giant you've always", "114:50", "been confused as to what that means Oh", "114:53", "most of its mass is in the form of gas", "114:54", "most of its oh yes 97% of its so when", "114:58", "shoemaker-levy slammed into Jupiter and", "115:01", "missed the gaseous atmosphere was like", "115:04", "hitting a brick wall whoa", "115:06", "that's how fast it was moving that's why", "115:09", "the explosion was exactly so it's slow", "115:13", "all of its kinetic energy that it had", "115:15", "got put back into the object itself", "115:19", "because it slowed down very quickly", "115:22", "relative to its speed I'm Ella t'v to", "115:25", "thee so so here's this comet I forgot", "115:28", "how big shoemaker-levy was so now it", "115:30", "goes into the atmosphere and you say oh", "115:31", "isn't it just clouds and it can a watch", "115:34", "how fast it's going you can ask the", "115:38", "question over how much distance will it", "115:40", "plow through its own mass worth of gas", "115:45", "well that's it that's a question right", "115:47", "right that's that it has to plow that", "115:49", "much mass out of the way that's an", "115:51", "important resistive force right so how", "115:54", "much atmosphere that's a lot of", "115:57", "atmosphere because it's gas and this", "115:59", "thing is solid", "115:59", "however the thing is going what 15 20", "116:03", "miles per second it's falling into", "116:06", "Jupiter at 20 Mont whatever the speed", "116:08", "was if you don't at 20 miles per second", "116:10", "you will cover that much atmosphere in a", "116:12", "fraction of a second so

goes back into the system", "116:23", "it's a comet made of ice ice is not held", "116:26", "together very easily the whole thing", "116:28", "explodes on impact that was another", "116:31",

"116:40", "the first second oh oh yeah these are", "116:43", "these are numbers that are staggering", "116:44", "once you calculate what they are and", "116:46", "like I said if you come in fast enough", "116:48", "Earth's atmosphere is a brick might as", "116:50", "well be a brick wall to you and by the", "116:53", "way you go 60 miles an hour down the", "116:55", "road roll down the window just stick", "116:57", "your hand out the window you have to use", "116:59", "muscle energy to not have your and your", "117:02", "hand blown backwards against 60 miles an", "117:06", "hour yeah of

second ten", "117:19", "miles per second 20 miles per second you", "117:25", "toast how deep did the asteroid that hit", "117:28", "and killed the dinosaurs how deep that", "117:30", "thing going or so what was that that was", "117:32", "a 150 mile diameter crater or something", "117:34", "like that I forgot the exact numbers so", "117:37", "these are there's a relationship between", "117:39", "the depth of a crater and the diameter", "117:40", "and the mass of the thing so no-goes", "117:43", "miles down I mean it's it's miles oh", "117:46", "yeah oh yeah well let me think an earth", "117:49", "rang for like a million years what", "117:50", "happens is let me pull take that back I", "117:53", "don't know if it's miles it's I think it", "117:58", "was when I had read I don't remember the", "118:00", "exact statistic what excuse me no no", "118:01", "it's gotta go miles now because the", "118:02", "thing is miles is mile is the the the", "118:06", "asteroid itself was the size of Mount", "118:08", "Everest", "118:08", "so the asteroid sauce is like five miles", "118:10", "across so it's deep no you just don't", "118:13", "mess with this by the way the crater in", "118:15", "Arizona called meteor crater for obvious", "118:18", "reasons that can sink a 60-story", "118:20", "building and it's not even a mile across", "118:23", "and now we're talking about a crater", "118:24", "more than a hundred miles across that", "118:26", "took out the dinosaurs that famous one", "118:28", "in Arizona I think a 60-story building", "118:30", "if you if you put dirt up to the rim of", "118:34", "that crater you can bury a 60 dad an", "118:36", "instance where you this is your whole", "118:38", "calculation about explosions and about", "118:40", "the amount of energy that", "118:41", "they were looking for the raw materials", "118:45", "that caused that crater thought that", "118:47", "they could mine it correct they first", "118:49", "thought is volcanic and the geologists", "118:52", "thought it was volcanic again and the", "118:54", "but one geologist in particular Eugene", "118:58", "shoemaker who was in line to be on one", "119:00", "of the lunar missions and then he had", "119:02", "like a heart murmur and then they sent", "119:04", "Jack Schmitt to in his stead who was", "119:07", "also geologist turned US senator from", "119:11", "Arizona", "119:13", "where was he senator from I forgot but", "119:15", "can you looked at Jack Schmitt where his", "119:18", "senator from forgive me forget because I", "119:20", "knew I'm friends with him so I should", "119:22", "have known that NASA Jack Schmitt schm", "119:25", "ITT it's not there's no D in it so Bubba", "119:30", "desk oh yes I was right yes in New", "119:32", "Mexico I said Arizona so New Mexico so", "119:34", "he but anyhow he's saying no this is", "119:38", "this is an impact crater and well if", "119:40", "it's an impact crater where is the", "119:43", "meteorite it must be buried down here", "119:45", "and so there were miners they were there", "119:47", "were there iron miners who bought the", "119:50", "the land so they can get this huge", "119:53", "meteor that they were sure was just", "119:56", "sitting down there that they could mine", "119:58", "for its natural resource they could not", "120:00", "find the meteor that's because it hit at", "120:04", "high

"90% of that thing vaporized on impact", "120:23", "Wow iron more impressive even than I", "120:27", "remember okay the pieces that's that's", "120:29", "nice low angle shot so you get the", "120:31", "shadows of the rim", "120:32", "that's an Arizona where where narrow", "120:34", "it's near Winslow Arizona where would", "120:36", "that be near someone wanted to fly in to", "120:38", "see that oh here it is if you go to the", "120:42", "Grand Canyon then you drive to this and", "120:45", "it's a couple hours two hours ok there's", "120:47", "me you're the man who's coming up and", "120:48", "where's the Grand Canyon there's meteor", "120:52", "crater", "120:54", "and Grand Canyon because it which is", "120:55", "also in Arizona Flashdance reports you", "120:59", "can drive that see that Grand Canyon to", "121:02", "your crater through Flagstaff yeah so", "121:04", "you're not gonna fly that you just drive", "121:06", "it and it has Yelp reviews it's a good", "121:12", "look", "121:13", "why does it have all the stars look I", "121:15", "know it should have every goddamn star", "121:17", "only three point nine so this hole was", "121:26", "this this meteor crater was dug in like", "121:28", "you know a few seconds this crater was", "121:32", "made yeah just and how many years ago is", "121:35", "that fifty thousand years ago that's not", "121:37", "oximetry nothing Wow", "121:39", "there's probably some form of human", "121:41", "living here then oh yeah yeah early", "121:43", "humans but I mean I don't know if they", "121:46", "were in North America I say 40,000 is", "121:48", "the most recent right yeah it was when", "121:50", "they crossed the Bering Strait yeah", "121:51", "that's one that they would have just", "121:52", "arrived man no that's cool I'm going", "121:56", "back", "121:57", "oh yeah multiple times oh yeah", "121:59", "is it freaky what's freaky about it is", "122:02", "you walk up to it you can't see it", "122:04", "because the rim of the crater it just", "122:06", "looks like a ridge a Ridgeline the rim", "122:09", "is raised above the plane of the area", "122:12", "right because when you press down it", "122:14", "raises it up a bit so you just walk up", "122:16", "to it and then you come up to the ledge", "122:18", "and in fact and you realize what it is", "122:22", "this is a nearly a mile diameter hole in", "122:25", "the ground", "122:26", "oh yeah it's a stunning it's a stunning", "122:30", "encounter with the forces of nature and", "122:33", "the fact that there's so many of those", "122:34", "particles just floating around out there", "122:37", "lamb right no that's that how big was", "122:40", "that when you think oh yeah that was", "122:41", "about", "122:47", "about 20 yards across something that's", "122:51", "nothing it's nothing that's nothing", "122:53", "that's it 20 yards yeah maybe", "122:55", "between 20 and 40 yards 20 yards is the", "122:58", "sizes yeah that's right from that garage", "123:00", "to that front door kind of stards yeah", "123:04", "yeah wow that's crazy right", "123:09", "that's nothing and that's the kind of", "123:10", "thing that can get close enough that you", "123:11", "don't even see and then it's too late", "123:13", "and that's not gonna make us extinct but", "123:17", "it'll make a very bad day for a city", "123:18", "yeah okay", "123:19", "oh yeah city's done and most likely the", "123:22", "power grids jacked for a long time too", "123:24", "right now no you have ten more minutes", "123:29", "okay so I had to get the Stephen", "123:30", "Hawking's quote out for you Stephen", "123:33", "Hawking's was talking about the the", "123:37", "possibility of alien life discovering us", "123:39", "and that it would be a terrible terrible", "123:42", "thing if it did happen if you look at", "123:44", "what has happened to other primitive", "123:47", "life-forms and we discovered them", "123:48", "primitive cultures and we've discovered", "123:50", "them do you share that same opinion that", "123:52", "if something did find us I don't have a", "123:55", "strong opinion on that question but I", "123:57", "have an analysis of his comment okay he", "124:00", "is worried about the possibility of", "124:05", "aliens enslaving us Oh based on the", "124:12", "reality that we've done that to", "124:15", "ourselves", "124:16", "yes just

you just let them all die", "129:19", "what what is that what's your you plan", "129:21", "to you don't let all the earth people", "129:22", "die in the Mars people survive just", "129:24", "you can
