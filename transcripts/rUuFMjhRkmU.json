think the movement", "25:54", "well it certainly did I mean it exposed", "25:57", "it well what it all deals with I think", "25:59", "with this this Bohemian Grove thing and", "26:02", "is this sort of cultish mind sets these", "26:08", "weird sort of mind sets where they", "26:10", "engage and otherwise preposterous", "26:12", "rituals that to the outsider like to us", "26:14", "like we're watching this owl God and a", "26:16", "fucking bundle of sticks and burn the", "26:20", "this is so fucking stupid", "26:22", "but to those people it represents this", "26:25", "thing they've all kind of agreed to do", "26:27", "this goofy shit together and there's", "26:29", "some weird power in that yeah I agree", "26:32", "with that it's it's definitely there for", "26:34", "a reason well

"27:55", "remember about my book well they said", "27:56", "they said something along the lines of", "27:58", "despite Jon Ronson's objectionable chess", "28:02", "passing we appreciate the fact that he's", "28:05", "putting a less kind of sensationalist", "28:07", "spin on what he saw then what Alex Jones", "28:11", "did and so they kind of appreciated the", "28:12", "fact that I was I was being less", "28:14", "hysterical about it than Alex and they", "28:16", "said you know it's it's overblown", "28:18", "it's an overblown pageant but it", "28:21", "couldn't be more innocent or something",

more", "28:45", "innocent you're you're burning someone", "28:47", "like and you're saying you I burn thee", "28:49", "and then you have screams that play out", "28:51", "over a loudspeaker", "28:52",

Alex's spin was", "29:23", "practically that you know it's possible", "29:25", "that they were killing an actual baby I", "29:28", "mean a long way oh what buddy said a", "29:34", "one-party center very yeah we overheard", "29:37", "these two old men that when we were", "29:38", "walking down the road", "29:39", "I mean it's true the me and Alex were", "29:40", "like separate Ternes you know but he", "29:43", "said at one point we overheard these two", "29:44", "old men going yeah we're gonna get him", "29:46", "elected and I thought like I don't know", "29:48", "that Alex didn't hear that but that's", "29:50", "that's a bit fucking convenient so", "29:52", "that's exactly the thing Alex would want", "29:54", "to hear at Bohemian Grove who knows what", "29:57", "that conversation when the bow takes", "29:59", "something out of context like that it", "30:00", "could have been a total complete joke", "30:02", "yeah it could have been elected to let", "30:04", "the local shrine have anything and the", "30:06", "boys who knows what the fuck they were", "30:09", "talking about yeah alex is one of those", "30:11", "jumped to conclusions confirmation", "30:14", "biased characters

"31:58", "and then they were all held up in this", "32:00", "one house and Alex documented it all not", "32:02", "with his own news footage and his own", "32:05", "reporting spin but basically just using", "32:07", "actual news stories and different", "32:11", "coverages by different local news", "32:13", "stations and showed like what the fuck", "32:15", "actually went on these people were

like", "32:44", "the best way to do it if they're being", "32:45", "peaceful is to have people that pretend", "32:47", "to be amongst them start smashing things", "32:49", "then you have an excuse to
