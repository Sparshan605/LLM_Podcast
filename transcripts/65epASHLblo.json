don't get held accountable", "08:36", "for this or I'm escaping accountability", "08:39", "over here or I get attention or sympathy", "08:42", "or if they can figure out what their", "08:43", "payoff is", "08:44", "and they can then control that whether", "08:48", "it's for themselves or their kids or", "08:49", "whatever if you control the currency", "08:51", "then you can control the behavior hmm", "08:53", "yeah it's it just seems that people have", "08:56", "they have this comfort in their patterns", "08:59", "and even if their patterns are", "09:02", "self-destructive even it's drug abuse or", "09:04", "alcoholism or did those those the", "09:06", "comfort in those patterns falling into", "09:08", "those patterns", "09:09", "it seems very compelling to a lot of", "09:11", "people yeah and payoffs don't", "09:13", "necessarily mean that it's a positive", "09:14", "payoff right", "09:16", "I mean payoff for taking heroin as you", "09:18", "get high and so you're high for a while", "09:21", "that's not a positive payoff but it's a", "09:23", "payoff right and if you if you get high", "09:27", "and so you don't get a job and you don't", "09:29", "take care of your kids",

you share the experience with them", "10:23", "now that becomes your payoff so then", "10:25", "you'll start showing it for your kid", "10:26", "yeah how many people take your advice", "10:28", "how many people just listened and try", "10:31", "for a little bit and then bail you know", "10:34", "it's hard to say because I think our", "10:38", "sometimes our most productive guests are", "10:41", "the ones that don't get it because the", "10:45", "mail we get they'll say oh wow that guy", "10:49", "didn't get her - that woman didn't get", "10:51", "it but I saw myself in them", "10:53", "and

I've said and they'd left and", "11:11", "didn't get it I got it I'll never do", "11:14", "that again so sometimes those that don't", "11:16", "get it at all while they're there are", "11:19", "the ones that are the best teaching", "11:21", "tools for the millions of people that", "11:22", "are home watching yeah that's", "11:24", "interesting isn't it when you watch", "11:25", "people fail and you go oh okay", "11:27", "I see that in myself yeah I just got to", "11:30", "not do what that guy's do and then also", "11:31", "do you see the stubborn pigheadedness", "11:33", "that some people have what they won't", "11:34", "listen to advice and you could clearly", "11:37", "see how they're ruining their lives by", "11:40", "not being honest yeah and sometimes the", "11:43", "story that we might have is maybe", "11:45", "extreme where you say I don't do all six", "11:48", "things they're doing but I do two of", "11:50", "them and they are in sharp relief to me", "11:53", "so I get that I'm gonna do that anymore", "11:55", "so I mean that's where I think you get a", "11:58", "payoff and you know people go and find", "12:02", "these things on the internet I mean last", "12:04", "year you know we have a channel where we", "12:06", "put up you know different clips and", "12:09", "divorce shows or parenting shows or", "12:11", "whatever and we had over 2 billion views", "12:14", "you know last year people just going and", "12:17", "finding that information and looking at", "12:18", "it so I know people are seeking the", "12:21", "information out and looking at beyond", "12:23",

"12:33", "they look I think they're hungry for and", "12:35", "they look for it well there's so many", "12:36", "people out there that are trying to do", "12:37", "better they're trying to get their lives", "12:39", "in order and you know shows like yours", "12:42", "and and you know just advice shows", "12:43", "people they're giving out inspiration", "12:45", "and knowledge it's so it's such an", "12:48", "important thing for people especially", "12:49", "for people that didn't grow up with wise", "12:52", "parents or maybe a good support system", "12:54", "around them you know I think that's", "12:57", "that's true and yeah I grew up with a", "13:00", "alcoholic father and it was a pretty", "13:03", "violent home and and he was a really bad", "13:07", "alcohol", "13:08", "and I know having grown up in that you", "13:14", "wind up with what I call a damaged", "13:17", "personal truth and you feel second-class", "13:22", "and the problem that kids make and", "13:26", "because I know I did it and and I and I", "13:30", "see others do it is you compare your", "13:33", "personal truth what you know about", "13:35", "yourself you know how you really live", "13:38", "and what's really going on you compare", "13:40", "your personal truth to everybody else's", "13:43", "social mask because you go to school and", "13:46", "you know well I know that last night the", "13:49", "windows got kicked out of my house I", "13:51", "know that the utilities got turned off", "13:54", "and I know there was a big fight in my", "13:56", "kitchen last night and the kids sitting", "13:59", "next to me he's got on a shirt that's", "14:01", "all ironed and his face is all bright", "14:04", "and clean and you know he looks like", "14:06", "he's just got it all together and you", "14:08", "compare yourself to that person that kid", "14:10", "and you feel like you're second-class", "14:13", "and the problem with that is we generate", "14:17", "the results in life we think we deserve", "14:20", "so if you think you're damaged do you", "14:22", "think you're second class you will", "14:24", "generate results that you think a second", "14:28", "class person deserves hmm so if you", "14:30", "don't fix your personal truth then", "14:34", "you'll spend the rest of your life", "14:35", "saying well you know those really good", "14:37", "results those belong for somebody else", "14:39", "that's not for me that's for somebody", "14:42", "else and you'll settle for second best", "14:43", "and you won't get what you might", "14:46", "otherwise generate for yourself if you", "14:48", "don't fix your personal truth and so I", "14:51", "think a lot of people are struggling", "14:53", "looking for a way to kind of get out of", "14:56", "feeling not good about themselves and", "14:57", "damage self-esteem damage self-worth and", "15:00", "they really don't know where to go so", "15:02", "and that's why I do the show I don't", "15:05", "look I'm not under the misapprehension", "15:07", "that we're doing eight minute cures if", "15:09", "they're mean come on yeah we're not", "15:11", "doing that but I think if you can point", "15:13", "people in the right direction if you can", "15:16", "raise their awareness you can get them", "15:18", "thinking about it you", "15:19", "and create a narrative where they at", "15:21", "least say you know how do I feel about", "15:23", "myself I mean is there stuff I need to", "15:26", "resolve I mean what am I saying to", "15:28", "myself if you can get them thinking", "15:29", "about that then you know maybe

obvious yeah", "54:43", "I heard a cop once say that when people", "54:45", "are guilty they tend to plead and cry", "54:49", "and then when they're not guilty they", "54:52", "tend to get angry when they're accused", "54:53", "people that are wrongly accused are", "54:56", "generally irate from the beginning till", "54:58", "the end I mean the every case is", "55:02", "different but if you're wrongly accused", "55:05", "that person is going to be pissed off", "55:07", "from the minute you accuse them till the", "55:09", "end because it's like I'm their self", "55:13", "righteous like I

work you", "63:51", "know there's a haunting thing that", "63:52", "happens with athletes where you're not", "63:55", "sure if you did enough and in fighters", "63:57", "it's a very dangerous inclination", "64:00", "because it leads you to over train and", "64:02", "you have to be very careful about that", "64:04", "because with a fighter you only can", "64:06", "learn so much during your

is maybe eight twelve", "64:16", "weeks is a long camp you already have to", "64:19", "know how to fight by the time you get to", "64:21", "camp so what you're really doing is just", "64:22", "kind of working on specific movements", "64:25", "where you're dealing with one kind of", "64:28", "fighter and then getting your body in", "64:30", "shape getting your body condition -", "64:32", "getting your mind ready preparing", "64:33", "everything cutting your bodyweight down", "64:35", "getting so you can weigh in and have a", "64:38", "good amount of just you got enough", "64:42", "vitality can't drain yourself so this is", "64:44", "complicated dance that goes on and that", "64:47", "haunting thing of did I do enough can", "64:50", "cause fighters to screw themselves over", "64:52", "by overtraining yeah so you have to have", "64:55", "enough confidence to know that you've", "64:58", "done enough as well as enough you have", "65:01", "to know you've done enough but no you", "65:03", "haven't done too much this is really", "65:05", "strange dance you know and this this", "65:08", "weekend is a giant UFC big UFC two big", "65:11", "title fights between four of the very", "65:13", "best fighters in the world and I mean", "65:16", "that is one of the most interesting", "65:17", "aspects of the fight game to me is one", "65:20", "watching these guys stare each other", "65:22", "down at the weigh-in where they get a", "65:24", "look at each other than they know 24", "65:25", "hours from now they're going to war and", "65:27", "just see like is there just us mellowed", "65:30", "out is there anything is there anything", "65:33", "in there you know and just knowing that", "65:36", "this is probably one of the most", "65:38", "difficult things in all of athletics and", "65:40", "that these guys are going", "65:42", "there they're gonna ply their trade and", "65:44", "one of the most complicated things it's", "65:47", "a battle of physical mental of mindset", "65:52", "of will of conditioning and discipline", "65:55", "and then it's also there's a lot of", "65:57", "random shit that happens do you think a", "66:00", "fight can change at a weigh-in when", "66:03", "people are looking at yes yes you think", "66:05", "it yeah it can change it can shift right", "66:08", "then it can't change forever but like", "66:09", "you could look at John Jones sideways", "66:12", "upside down you could stick you to it", "66:14", "ain't gonna affect shit there's some", "66:16", "guys that are just locked down and", "66:17", "bulletproof", "66:18", "John Jones is bulletproof there's", "66:20", "certain guys that was just bulletproof", "66:21", "they just look at you and like they know", "66:23", "what to do there's a reason why he's", "66:25", "undefeated you know he's just he knows", "66:26", "how to do it but then there's other guys", "66:28", "that like that maybe like maybe it's", "66:31", "80/20 maybe and then the the staredown", "66:35", "you look at the guy and you're looking", "66:36", "at my god damn and I'm fighting Yoel", "66:38", "Romero how the fuck did this happen and", "66:40", "then you see him drop down to 75 maybe", "66:44", "73 percent confidence 72 70 shit they", "66:48", "look at his traps he's got a neck that", "66:50", "starts at the top of his head you like", "66:51", "off fuck you know there's certain guys", "66:54", "they're just they're intimidating at", "66:56", "weigh-ins - yeah yeah it can change a", "66:58", "little bit but not for everybody there's", "67:00", "certain guys that just it doesn't matter", "67:03", "you can't get in there there's certain", "67:04", "champions like real champions like", "67:06", "Mighty Mouse Johnson there's a bunch of", "67:08", "guys like that that are just champions", "67:11", "you look at them it doesn't matter they", "67:13", "know what they're doing they've done the", "67:14", "work they're the best in the business", "67:16", "like you can mean mug them and get", "67:18", "aggressive they might smile at you then", "67:20", "way this is cute try to make me nervous", "67:22", "hilarious see you tomorrow yeah so is", "67:26", "that because they know who they are and", "67:29", "it doesn't matter who this is or is it", "67:33", "that they just don't they don't believe", "67:36", "in this guy it's they know who they are", "67:39", "I think and they have reached a level of", "67:42", "confidence when you get to a certain", "67:43", "level of success like you know John", "67:45", "Jones has one loss in his records by", "67:47", "disqualification a fight that he was", "67:49", "destroying the guy and he was hitting", "67:50", "the guy with it's a really dumb rule but", "67:52", "when you throw elbows you're not allowed", "67:54", "to", "67:55", "throw a 12 to 6 elbow meaning coming", "67:57", "straight down the only reason that", "67:58", "exists is because when mixed martial", "68:01", "arts is first being was first being", "68:04", "sanctioned by athletic commissions the", "68:06", "the people that were in the Athletic", "68:07", "Commission had some nervous fears of", "68:10", "they had seen like those late-night TV", "68:13", "shows or karate guys are breaking bricks", "68:14", "with their elbow", "68:16", "driving straight down they thought they", "68:17", "could kill somebody if they did that so", "68:19", "let's not have we'll eliminate that", "68:21", "strike it's a dumb move and John Jones", "68:23", "hit this guy with a couple 12 to 6", "68:26", "elbows and he was disqualified in a", "68:28", "fight he was just just destroying the", "68:30", "guy so for a guy like that who has this", "68:33", "staggering resume of achievement he's", "68:35", "widely considered to be the greatest", "68:37", "light heavyweight champion of all time", "68:39", "if not he's definitely in the running of", "68:41", "the greatest fighter ever of all time", "68:42", "for a guy like that he's not he's he's", "68:46", "confident to the point of you know he's", "68:49", "he's he's not trying to just beat this", "68:52", "guy although he's going to beat this guy", "68:54", "he's trying to go down in history as one", "68:55", "of the Great's of all time what the", "68:57", "greatest of all time so for a guy like", "68:59", "that it doesn't matter what you do he's", "69:02", "not that he's a

businesslike he knows", "69:22", "what he's doing", "69:23", "the best guys fight business like", "69:24", "there's some guys that fight with", "69:26", "emotion and they're still really good",

"69:35", "orbit in you know he was just uh you", "69:38", "know he was the highest level of that", "69:40", "like that", "69:41", "robotic businesslike approach to", "69:43", "fighting and then after he'd knocked", "69:45", "unconscious he'd help you get back up", "69:46", "yeah it was over once he shut it off it", "69:48", "was over there's no no sign he thought", "69:50", "emotions were weak like showing emotions", "69:52", "in a fight showing anger all that was", "69:54", "weak yeah I think there's a huge", "69:58", "psychological component to it I mean I", "70:01", "agree completely", "70:02", "giant gigantic I think if you I think if", "70:06", "you go in with doubt", "70:08", "man I think that's terrible terrible", "70:12", "yeah thank you", "70:14", "just now you're fighting

"72:44", "is connected yeah he learned you know I", "72:47", "mean it's easy to try to look at someone", "72:49", "like who they were you know 20 years ago", "72:52", "it's it's easy to do that it's easy just", "72:54", "oh he's that guy but people evolve and", "72:57", "they grow and he's a great example of", "72:59", "that he's a very different person you", "73:01", "know he doesn't even work

you'd never would yeah I think the", "73:56", "psychological aspect of fighting is one", "73:58", "of the more intriguing parts of it to me", "74:00", "and you know for me it's like probably", "74:03", "one of the reasons why I got interested", "74:04", "in psyche in the first place and the way", "74:08", "people think about things and and", "74:10", "weakness like real weakness weakness", "74:12", "weakness can get exposed in a variety of", "74:15", "different ways but in competition is", "74:17", "when you really see it yeah I'm one of", "74:20", "the I have this theory you know and

goes", "74:34", "into the football", "74:34", "he says he plays a movie in his mind of", "74:37", "the entire game before he plays it", "74:40", "because you know in a football game", "74:42", "you're gonna have 11 or 12 possessions", "74:44", "during the game you just throw out the", "74:47", "football game you can get that ball 11", "74:48", "or 12 times and you'd say and I'm gonna", "74:50", "carry that ball three or four times per", "74:52", "possession and he knows which plays he's", "74:55", "gonna run he would run him through his", "74:57", "head he would see it he would know who",
