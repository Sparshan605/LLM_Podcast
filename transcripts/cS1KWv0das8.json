"00:20", "yeah it's a different thing when you fly", "00:22", "over it you go oh do think that baby", "00:25", "yeah that's here this is that cuz what", "00:27", "if it I remember when I was still", "00:29", "getting my license and I was doing a", "00:31", "night flight right mom which is insane", "00:33", "totally different ballgame", "00:35", "and uh yeah cuz when you're on the", "00:37", "ground you like Wow be really easy to", "00:38", "see everybody because you're looking up", "00:40", "and all you've seen is the backdrop is", "00:41", "of the dark sky right but when you get",

my head it took", "01:09", "like two hours to get there hour and a", "01:11", "half going down the five but it's just", "01:14", "like because you don't look at miles all", "01:17", "you do is look at time when you're", "01:18", "around here because there's so much", "01:19", "traffic but it's literally like oh", "01:21", "that's like 40 miles it's not even it's", "01:24", "like from Hollywood like I would think", "01:26", "it can't even be more than 15 20 miles", "01:28", "away like Anaheim is so fucking close", "01:31", "but I just it's just hurt that you're", "01:33", "Irvine comedy club that's all I think of", "01:34", "it's just fucking way the fuck down", "01:36", "there and then you get up in a", "01:39", "helicopter and you're like they're in", "01:40", "like 11 minutes going like this is this", "01:42", "is ridiculous so yeah yeah that's", "01:47", "awesome dude it was awesome yeah it was", "01:49", "when you landed on top of that little", "01:52", "hill there with a picnic table", "01:53", "yeah dude this morning I said it down", "01:56", "nice I was little nervous oh my god", "01:57", "don't smoke don't fuck this up with joe", "01:59", "here cuz he's gonna be like a burro you", "02:00", "know it's alright when he was flying", "02:02", "when he was the big part when he went to", "02:04", "land he wasn't that good but I was", "02:06", "smooth and then the Apocalypse Now shit", "02:08", "we're going through the canyon", "02:10", "that was awesome man yeah those are I", "02:13", "get it", "02:14", "those are fun that's it's a it's a lot", "02:17", "of fun and you know I fly mostly with an", "02:19", "instructor cuz I got the kid and", "02:20", "everything but every once in a while you", "02:21", "got to go up by yourself just so you", "02:23", "know you can do it but I also I'm", "02:27", "actually over to over do to do it but I", "02:29", "always go out and I do like the auto", "02:30", "rotations and he'll just sort of cut I'm", "02:32", "flying along he'll just chop throttle", "02:33", "and like it's just it's just rolling the", "02:35", "RPMs I mean rolling the engine now not", "02:36", "the RPMs the engine down and then you", "02:39", "immediately have to pick a spot you know", "02:40", "and sometimes you know the lower you are", "02:42", "you know it becomes literally what you", "02:44", "the first place you look is where you're", "02:46", "putting it it's really crazy but when", "02:49", "you would what you're talking about you", "02:50", "mean", "02:51", "crash landing that's what autorotation", "02:52", "means yeah it'd be basically if you had", "02:54", "some sort of failure problem your engine", "02:57", "failure whatever so like when you're", "02:59", "flying along the engines working it's", "03:00", "drawing air into the disc and that's", "03:02", "what creates lift but when when you go", "03:05", "into an auto rotation it's it's the air", "03:08", "rushing you're using gravity bringing", "03:11", "the the helicopter down using that air", "03:15", "like almost like a fan to keep it going", "03:17", "no so and there's a critical point where", "03:19", "if you let the main rotor go too slow", "03:21", "that's why the low rpm horn comes on", "03:23", "which is just a nauseating sound if you", "03:26", "let it go too low that when it gets to a", "03:29", "point where if it's spinning too slowly", "03:31", "no matter how fast you drop you can't", "03:33", "get it going again fast enough to create", "03:36", "and you're basically at that point", "03:37", "you're in something that's no longer", "03:38", "able to fly you're your instructor", "03:41", "Skyler so yeah", "03:42", "Skyler pointed out something I didn't", "03:44", "know that they have to redo those things", "03:46", "like every X amount of miles they", "03:49", "rebuild every hours yeah yeah it's well", "03:51", "they have like there's all this", "03:52", "maintenance along the way they're", "03:54", "incredibly maintained because I'm sure", "03:57", "you noticed if you read the comments all", "03:58", "people talk about is dying in aviation", "04:01", "it's like uh that's how entertainers die", "04:03", "it's like no it isn't they overdose if", "04:05", "you really look at the graph there on", "04:07", "the ground completely safe overdose car", "04:11", "accidents there's always overdose", "04:13", "drinking yeah and shit like that and", "04:15", "it's just like that's mainly how you die", "04:18", "like the amount of people that are up", "04:19", "there every day and the nothing happens", "04:22", "it's it's you know but there", "04:24", "you know the the fly in the ointment is", "04:26", "that this there are particularly at the", "04:29", "private level there are knuckleheads out", "04:32", "there like there's people like I think", "04:35", "every time I get in I'm always thinking", "04:36", "like am I gonna you know I don't want to", "04:38", "die today so I go over all about a whole", "04:41", "bunch of shit and you know especially if", "04:43", "I want to fly solo I have the whole", "04:45", "flight I have all my options on you know", "04:49", "where I could land you know if I had a", "04:52", "problem like that's what you're supposed", "04:54", "to do I look at weather reports I do all", "04:56", "of that shit and what happens is guys", "04:58", "get more and more confident and their", "05:00", "pre-flight is they kind of look it looks", "05:02", "pretty clear and then they go out there", "05:04", "and you know this you know this there's", "05:08", "people who go up knowing that they can", "05:10", "die and then there's other people up", "05:11", "there who just like magnum p.i and they", "05:13", "want to fly by waterfalls and shit I", "05:15", "mean those guys have more fun but it's", "05:19", "you know there's definitely those are", "05:23", "the people that you know you're supposed", "05:24", "to fly there's like two envelopes you're", "05:25", "supposed to fly within the envelope of", "05:27", "what you're flying and then you know", "05:28", "your skill set so you don't fly in this", "05:31", "shit this like you know like if it's too", "05:34", "windy or whatever I'm just I'm just not", "05:35", "going right even if I could handle it", "05:37", "it's like I'm not gonna have fun up", "05:38", "there fucking you know riding it out and", "05:41", "just you know let the wind do what it", "05:42", "wants to do and don't fight it and you", "05:44", "know make sure you know you're not", "05:46", "flying to fail all you do is slow down", "05:47", "you know but you know it's it's that", "05:51", "there are elements of that but like if", "05:53", "you look up there versus what's going on", "05:55", "down below when you fly I always say", "05:57", "this when you drive on the highway it's", "05:59", "like you're flying in formation you're", "06:00", "in the Blue Angels yeah with a bunt with", "06:02", "nobody talking to anybody you have no", "06:04", "idea what anybody's gonna do people are", "06:06", "texting they're on medication they're", "06:09", "fucking hungover they're suicide what", "06:10", "the fuck they're doing you know and then", "06:12", "the top of that you got to look out for", "06:13", "the guys splitting lanes and the", "06:14", "motorcycles and shit it's pretty amazing", "06:17", "how few accidents are actually are there", "06:19", "it is it is and what I fly the Robinsons", "06:21", "they get a bad rap saying they're not", "06:23", "safe because they look at the amount of", "06:24", "crashes that they've had but it's", "06:27", "because it's a helicopter you can afford", "06:30", "so it's inherently a low our pilot and", "06:33", "if you look at it it's most of the time", "06:35", "it's not it's not the", "06:38", "it's the it's the person flying it which", "06:42", "is why you really have to be on it like", "06:44", "you you you can't it's it's just not", "06:46", "something I don't know how explain it", "06:50", "it's this weird thing where your your", "06:53", "level of enjoyment is way higher if", "06:54", "you're if you're riding in it you know", "06:56", "if you're the person flying the whole", "06:58", "time you have your life and other", "06:59", "people's life's at hand so that you're", "07:01", "not really oh look at that oh look at", "07:03", "that look at that yeah I'm also like you", "07:04", "know thinking things of like you know", "07:06", "when we were flying through that Canyon", "07:08", "Union you thought that at that I think", "07:09", "in that shit I'm looking you know", "07:12", "knowing where the wires are and where", "07:14", "the road is because that's all fuckin", "07:16", "trees so it's gonna be the road so", "07:18", "there's those you know when you're kind", "07:20", "of going around a bend you know it", "07:21", "there's certain like altitudes and stuff", "07:23", "just it's it's boring but it's just", "07:25", "stuff that you're always thinking that", "07:28", "you know I imagine like when you fight", "07:31", "there's that you know I know a lot of", "07:32", "it's like instinct and stuff but this", "07:34", "these things that you just don't do you", "07:36", "know what I mean I don't know anything", "07:37", "about fighting I was hurt in boxing you", "07:38", "know lead with an uppercut it's just", "07:39", "it's just fucking things mm-hmm you", "07:41", "don't you see a lot of guys like when", "07:43", "they go to take off they do this fucking", "07:44", "thing like the nose down attitude like I", "07:46", "was taught not to do that because I they", "07:47", "do that cuz it looks cool I don't know", "07:50", "why they do it I mean you're supposed to", "07:52", "look I was taught you're supposed to", "07:53", "keep it level so that way if you have a", "07:56", "problem you know you you're already in", "07:58", "you the right attitude to just", "08:01", "immediately enter enter an auto like now", "08:03", "if I'm fucking nose down and if I'm too", "08:05", "far to the ground I was gonna fucking go", "08:06", "right into the ground I don't know but I", "08:09", "mean I'm still like totally a novice I'm", "08:11", "coming up on 200 hours so I don't know a", "08:13", "lot but I'm super super super super", "08:15", "fucking cautious and I make sure I don't", "08:19", "go too long without doing auto rotations", "08:22", "I used to hate them", "08:23", "and now I actually really liked them it", "08:26", "was sort of the way it was explained to", "08:27", "me I didn't get it until one day I just", "08:30", "thought about it and then I got it and I", "08:32", "was able to lock into it because it's", "08:34", "but it's the same inputs if you were", "08:35", "going in for a landing but they broke it", "08:37", "down to like four steps like it was low", "08:40", "rpm you know lower collective gentle F", "08:43", "cyclic", "08:44", "you know look at your trim strings you", "08:46", "know it was a trim state trim airspeed", "08:50", "rpms and just fucking doing all", "08:52", "this and the reality is just like it's", "08:54", "the on right pedal Jesus Christ I forgot", "08:56", "that right pedal so it's all the same", "08:58", "it's all the same input if you were", "09:00", "going in for a landing", "09:01", "so all I do anytime I'm here the low rpm", "09:04", "is I just do that and then I'm locked", "09:05", "into it and then I'm just watching my", "09:08", "then I can just watch my rpms and at", "09:10", "this point I've flown enough where I", "09:11", "kind of know where I'm in trim which", "09:12", "basically means you're not like crabbing", "09:14", "and you're kind of going straight and", "09:15", "then you can kind of like pick out your", "09:16", "spot and then it becomes fun is what's", "09:18", "cool is you can do like 180 autos you", "09:20", "can turn around and what I do like about", "09:22", "it is when you come down to the ground", "09:24", "as you can bleed off all of your", "09:25", "airspeed that forward motion that's", "09:28", "gonna fucking kill you and as long as", "09:30", "you don't fuck up and flare and go back", "09:32", "up and then drop like it you know you", "09:34", "know it's kind of like a hockey stop as", "09:36", "the way it was described to me just", "09:37", "level it out and right as you go to drop", "09:38", "you pull like that and these guys land", "09:40", "on like daisies and stuff it's it's", "09:42", "really amazing I'm not as good as that", "09:44", "but like I will do it where you know", "09:46", "worst case scenario you know I might", "09:48", "fuck like get a little bit of a bomb", "09:51", "yeah but I'm gonna be alright so yeah I", "09:55", "don't know now there's probably a bunch", "09:56", "of people saying I don't know what the", "09:57", "fuck I'm talking about which admittedly", "09:59", "you know I still think there's a lot of", "10:00", "shit I need to learn about stand-up so", "10:01", "as long as you go into things like that", "10:04", "you know well the the fact that you're", "10:07", "doing it and the fact you learning a new", "10:09", "thing that's really difficult to learn", "10:11", "don't you think that that's good for", "10:12", "your brain no I am a big believer in", "10:16", "constantly learning it's why I like you", "10:19", "as a person because you're constantly", "10:22", "like you're not the Joe I knew three", "10:24", "years ago in a good way", "10:25", "you're like you you learn all of this", "10:27", "you know I first met you you weren't", "10:29", "hunting you were into Marsh that was", "10:32", "thinking you would you a two dimensional", "10:34", "you were which was amazing because", "10:35", "everyone was just a community with this", "10:36", "Taekwondo champion stand-up guy and then", "10:40", "and then since then you've added all", "10:42", "like the guests that you have on the", "10:44", "fact that you're able to like talk to", "10:45", "him when stuff is because you've", "10:47", "continued to you know you know it's it's", "10:51", "the same thing with like a comic who", "10:52", "writes his first hour and then just sits", "10:54", "on it for like eight years", "10:55", "yeah and all of a sudden two presidents", "10:57", "goes by and it's like why aren't they", "10:58", "laughing anymore it's like because", "10:59", "you're just stuck in time so III yeah I", "11:03", "believe in that I also believe in", "11:04", "playing cards", "11:05", "card games and stuff is good for you and", "11:07", "in any games if they say yeah video", "11:10", "games you know people like the shit on", "11:11", "video games but they say video games", "11:12", "have a positive cognitive effect on kids", "11:15", "yeah this is calculating and move it", "11:17", "you're thinking fast yeah they're", "11:19", "hand-eye coordination is like insane", "11:20", "yeah I guess if you some of those games", "11:22", "if if you play them I guess I don't know", "11:24", "well that you think about the amount of", "11:26", "hours they're putting into their thumbs", "11:27", "just how often do you really use your", "11:30", "thumb and like detailed ways very rarely", "11:32", "but kids today ridiculous thumb", "11:35", "dexterity I tapped out Grand Theft Auto", "11:38", "3 is when I stop which is about 2003", "11:41", "2002 or something I just think they were", "11:43", "just too amazing and I was just like I", "11:47", "am nowhere in my career right now and", "11:49", "this is just dude I was walking around", "11:51", "living in New York at the time and I", "11:52", "would stop playing the game and I would", "11:55", "be walking down the street thinking", "11:56", "about it like what I could walk into the", "11:58", "subway you know like not thinking about", "12:00", "jokes thinking how I could beat this", "12:02", "next level I remember I played this", "12:04", "medal of honor game and they had this", "12:08", "thing when you hit the sniper button", "12:09", "like the scope would go like that and", "12:11", "Exce would go like that and I played it", "12:13", "one day a 1-week so much that when I", "12:15", "walked out on the street I was looking", "12:17", "at people across the street doing like", "12:18", "their that X just like there's something", "12:21", "about like I already I'm not the", "12:24", "brightest guy you know when it comes to", "12:26", "like school and shit so it's just like I", "12:28", "was like this is doing something to my", "12:29", "brain so I kind of remember came home", "12:31", "and I just unplugged everything but", "12:34", "really quickly took everything off", "12:35", "because I knew I was never gonna figure", "12:36", "it out and I didn't have any", "12:37", "instructions anymore I just stuck it in", "12:39", "the back like well that's it I did the", "12:43", "same thing with video games with quake I", "12:45", "had a real problem when I was playing", "12:47", "eight hours a day ten hours a day", "12:49", "sometimes I had a t1 line installed in", "12:52", "my house just so I could play with a", "12:54", "fast internet connection this is like", "12:56", "1998 yeah this is crazy I mean there was", "12:59", "slow internet where I was so I said well", "13:01", "what's the options and so one option is", "13:03", "they chew up the street and put this", "13:04", "fucking crazy fat business line cost me", "13:06", "a shitload of money and I was like let's", "13:08", "do it so it stalled a fucking business", "13:12", "line that would use at the time you'd", "13:13", "use for a large building right and I had", "13:15", "it just for my my house and", "13:18", "I would play video games online all the", "13:20", "time and you could play online against", "13:23", "people for the last 20 years", "13:24", "oh yeah I didn't know that we play", "13:26", "online teams we'd have teams of guys", "13:28", "like like me and three of my friends", "13:30", "would play against four other guys and", "13:32", "we'd like meet at a certain server and", "13:34", "you know you could chat talk to each", "13:36", "other all right you ready to go all", "13:38", "right let's go three two one go and then", "13:39", "you know what the game will start and", "13:42", "then we we'd fucking have these matches", "13:44", "and it was fun man it was really fun it", "13:46", "was really exciting too because it's all", "13:48", "happening in real time yeah but I", "13:49", "reached a point somewhere around like", "13:53", "the year 2000 where I know one day I", "13:56", "played until it was sunlight until the", "13:58", "Sun came up and you know I'm fucking", "14:01", "thirty years old", "14:02", "yeah and I'm sitting there my hands are", "14:03", "sweating I'm all fuckin caffeinated up", "14:07", "I've been drinking Mountain Dew for the", "14:09", "past eight hours and I realized like", "14:11", "what am i doing like this is I you know", "14:13", "I'm not where I want to be as a comic", "14:15", "I'm not wearing where I want to be with", "14:17", "my life and I'm just sitting here", "14:19", "playing video games all the time and", "14:21", "there's no future in this because I've", "14:23", "been stuck in things where there's no", "14:25", "future before I know what that is I felt", "14:27", "like that with fighting I was when I was", "14:29", "21 there was a point in time where I was", "14:31", "like there's no future in this I'm just", "14:33", "gonna keep getting hit in the head and", "14:34", "I'm gonna get dumber and more brain", "14:36", "damaged and more crazy I'm like this is", "14:39", "dangerous and I realized I am I gonna", "14:41", "stop I gotta stop there's no fear in", "14:43", "this there was no money and fighting", "14:44", "back then either", "14:45", "and then I got there with pool same", "14:47", "thing with pool like my manager called", "14:48", "me up and he said I think you play pool", "14:51", "too much he's like he's like I think", "14:56", "that you seriously think about pool more", "14:59", "than you do your career and I respect", "15:01", "him and he's a very good friend of mine", "15:02", "so I
