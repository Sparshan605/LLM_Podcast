wizard at all of your chance", "40:47", "but what he does is just the probably", "40:51", "the safest way to do it the smartest way", "40:53", "to do it because he's just so competent", "40:55", "that he's not getting hit and he's is", "40:57", "his tactics are so clever and so", "41:00", "skillful that he's able to like avoid a", "41:03", "lot of like big bombs that come his way", "41:05", "right
