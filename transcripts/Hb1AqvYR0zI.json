you say mental health it's", "125:57", "like there's lots of people who suffer", "125:59", "from like anxiety depression and like", "126:01", "all these things it doesn't mean they're", "126:02", "a risk to others like what are you", "126:04", "actually gonna say like I'm for", "126:05", "unfettered gun rights but everyone has", "126:09", "to have like a psychological exam and", "126:11", "it's

issue", "126:33", "because there aren't literally on most", "126:35", "of them like the vast percentage of them", "126:37", "are on mental medication so the question", "126:41", "is whether or not it's the mental health", "126:42", "medication that's causing them to do", "126:45", "this shit or whether or not they were", "126:46", "already crazy and that medication was", "126:48", "just trying to treat this disease and", "126:50", "they got ahold of guns and that's the", "126:51", "promise to guns yeah so maybe I didn't", "126:53", "say that like precisely enough because I", "126:54",

mental", "127:00", "health issues they shouldn't be allowed", "127:01", "to get guns is way too broad but you", "127:03", "know I actually I think again like you", "127:06", "mentioned earlier it's
