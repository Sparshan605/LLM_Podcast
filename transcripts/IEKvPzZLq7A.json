"63:27", "of the the flow of nature and but I was", "63:33", "also like it's the end by the time the", "63:35", "end of Burning Man like there are people", "63:37", "there all week and building it and", "63:38", "putting all the stuff together an artist", "63:39", "that's interesting and then like there", "63:41", "is definitely of a section of Burning", "63:43", "Man which is just like super

then when you have", "64:31", "something like a fire and then on top of", "64:33", "that you have a giant group of people", "64:35", "yeah it seemed and then you realize", "64:36", "there's not really a lot of law", "64:38", "enforcement here it just seems like", "64:39", "completely chaotic", "64:41", "yeah it's and it is like the fire itself", "64:43", "is protected cuz I think someone ran", "64:45", "into the fire last year yeah yeah", "64:47", "fucking killed himself after Chum ran", "64:49", "right in that fire this year was like", "64:51", "this year was pretty well regulated like", "64:54", "because we had seen a couple nights", "64:55", "before at sunrise there was like you", "64:58", "know they have all this it's what I", "64:59", "found do it it was like the kind of the", "65:01", "duality of at all like Burning Man feels", "65:04", "very much like there's this like sacred", "65:05", "and profane shit all happening together", "65:07", "and it's oftentimes pretty cool and like", "65:11", "sunrise a couple mornings earlier", "65:13", "there's this like 20-foot wooden", "65:16", "dragonfly statue that someone had built", "65:18", "and they are they light it on fire you", "65:21", "know they're just like now we're gonna", "65:23", "burn it like some dude it's been a year", "65:24", "making this statue as I now we're gonna", "65:26", "fucking burn it and so there there were", "65:29", "Park Rangers all around it", "65:32", "so there's no getting inside they light", "65:34", "it on fire and then the Sun rises over", "65:36", "to the left and then you looked I looked", "65:39", "up and there were like 30 people", "65:40", "parachuting out of this guy at sunrise", "65:43", "and you're just like what the fuck is", "65:45", "going on it was met it's it was really", "65:47", "cool I really I enjoyed that but by the", "65:50", "time Saturday rolled around you know", "65:53", "there is something about fire that's", "65:55", "very primal and you can feel like", "65:57", "there's like there's some pagan quality", "65:59", "to it all and it's cool but it's like", "66:02", "you could feel like everybody's like", "66:04", "energy kind of getting like a little", "66:07", "darker and more primal and and I hit a", "66:10", "point where I was like all right guys I", "66:12", "gotta I gotta get the out of this like", "66:14", "seven teeth and I also had a fear of", "66:16", "like I wasn't scared of the fire I was", "66:18", "scared of like I was seated watching and", "66:21", "I was like I'm scared of a trampling", "66:22", "yeah that's what I mean by like the", "66:24", "giant group of people and then also with", "66:27", "a fire and and then a gathering when", "66:30", "when you're dealing with a big gathering", "66:32", "there's always the potential for someone", "66:33", "acting out whether they just need a lot", "66:36", "of attention or they go crazy or I mean", "66:40", "think about adverse reactions to", "66:42", "psychedelics yes and 70,000 people the", "66:44", "potential for something going haywire is", "66:47", "pretty high yeah what I found", "66:49", "interesting over the whole week was", "66:51", "because I was pretty skeptical I didn't", "66:52", "go in I went in being like I want to", "66:55", "experience this thing that a lot of", "66:56", "people have experienced I just want to", "66:58", "like know what that

"the way you're gonna say it onstage it", "93:32", "will come off clunky but eventually", "93:34", "you'll get it yeah but the the", "93:36", "difference to me is if I just write in", "93:39", "my head and then go onstage and I have a", "93:41", "good premise and I work it out and it", "93:43", "turns into a bit and as long as I do it", "93:45", "a lot I memorize it that usually does", "93:48", "work but it's better if I write it out", "93:51", "and do that it's better if I do both", "93:54", "things", "93:54", "bet it's I still give myself a lot of", "93:57", "room on stage to fuck around yeah", "93:59", "and I will like just take a premise and", "94:01", "run with it on stage but if I have a bit", "94:03", "now I don't allow myself to not sit in", "94:07", "front of the screen and just right yeah", "94:10", "right that bit like there if there's a", "94:11", "bit on like I said bottled water if I", "94:13", "there's a bit on bottled water I will", "94:15", "write that bit out and I will write it", "94:17", "again and I'll write it again and I'll", "94:19", "just open up Microsoft Word and start", "94:21", "from scratch I'll say okay let's just", "94:24", "start that bit over again let's see what", "94:26", "about maybe if I just did it today would", "94:27", "I do it any differently thing you got to", "94:29", "leave that time to do that yeah you have", "94:32", "to I really feel like there's a lot of", "94:34", "people that say all right on stage okay", "94:36", "I run on stage too but I feel like if I", "94:38", "write on stage end I ride in a computer", "94:41", "it's better yeah I feel like my writing", "94:44", "is better my bits are they have more", "94:46", "depth to them yeah well you're you're", "94:48", "taking the time to actually think of it", "94:49", "and then leaving yourself that room", "94:51", "that's what it is yeah it's the time", "94:52", "it's the time and the focus the amount", "94:54", "of time thinking about it that's what I", "94:56", "can't that's what I'm like especially", "94:58", "when I'm on the show I'm just like that", "94:59", "time is not there yeah I got it but I'm", "95:01", "like it's you got to decide I feel like", "95:03", "it's just like whatever you're doing", "95:04", "you're gonna fucking jump in and do it", "95:06", "or try it yeah whatever it is well", "95:08", "that's one of the reasons I like", "95:09", "podcasts so much cuz I'm fucking lazy", "95:11", "and you don't have to do anything you", "95:13", "just show up and start talking yeah like", "95:14", "you and I just talked we've already been", "95:16", "talking for fucking two hours you just", "95:18", "start talking yeah that's it but it's", "95:22", "interesting like people are happy to", "95:24", "have that digests it in this format", "95:26", "right now yeah but do you think you", "95:28", "could get away with this on stage no", "95:30", "yeah I mean you could do a podcast on", "95:32", "stage if they knew they were coming to", "95:33", "see you live yeah it's just they would", "95:35", "enjoy it right and people do enjoy it", "95:37", "but it becomes a view done by pop yes", "95:39", "yeah weird right it's weird

"96:13", "or fuck around right this is a structure", "96:15", "there's a structure to it that I feel", "96:17", "like an alive audience loves and", "96:19", "deserves like they're psyched about it", "96:20", "they also know what they're getting in", "96:21", "that case but I I agree just like us", "96:24", "shooting the shit on stage it's like", "96:25", "people paid real money they want to see",

doing", "96:59", "all hello which is like we're not going", "97:00", "to acknowledge these fucking people", "97:03", "let's let them know what we're doing", "97:05", "that's the cool thing about that

"fucking ready for lunch like the this", "97:42", "isn't some this isn't Mozart like we", "97:45", "didn't write some perfect song it", "97:47", "requires like yeah you know like I", "97:49", "respect

particular situation on this day so", "98:00", "let's also realize that that and I", "98:02", "accept that when I write for other", "98:03", "people that like whatever I was trying", "98:06", "to do in that room let's try to get that", "98:08", "but let's also acknowledge where we are", "98:11", "in this new moment you know yeah that", "98:14", "was one of the more amazing things about", "98:15", "working with Paul Sims on Newsradio is", "98:18", "that he allowed you to rewrite entire", "98:21", "scenes and I really yeah Dave Foley was", "98:24", "really like a secret producer", "98:27", "that show his Dave Foley is such a", "98:28", "brilliant writer what he would do is", "98:31", "like there would be a scene that", "98:32", "wouldn't work and he would sit back and", "98:34", "be like okay why doesn't how about if", "98:38", "Vicki comes in and she introduces this", "98:41", "and then Moore comes in like here and", "98:44", "then he will he will have like a totally", "98:46", "different thing and he'll say to Paul", "98:47", "like I we have a new thing for you tell", "98:51", "us what you think", "98:52", "uh-huh and Paul will go love it yeah and", "98:54", "thank you guys that was in rehearsals", "98:56", "leading up to it but I think that that's", "98:57", "like to me the best creators and I mean", "99:01", "I think there are some like auteur", "99:03", "geniuses but I think the from in general", "99:08", "the best people are the ones who are ego", "99:11", "is enough in check that they can be like", "99:14", "I brought you in to collaborate with me", "99:17", "let's hear what you have to say cuz it", "99:19", "might be better and it'll make me", "99:21", "equally look good nobody knows yeah", "99:23", "nobody knows that like it's gonna still", "99:25", "say like Paul Sims created the show", "99:27", "nobody's gonna know that Foley did a did", "99:30", "a interesting like rewrite on a", "99:31", "rehearsal well I think Paul would even", "99:33", "tell you but the thing about it was that", "99:35", "when you write something out just like", "99:37", "we were talking about before if you", "99:38", "write jokes they don't come to life", "99:40", "unless there's people there they come to", "99:42", "life when you're actually performing you", "99:44", "like a joke just doesn't exist in a", "99:47", "vacuum it they they've really you really", "99:49", "need an
