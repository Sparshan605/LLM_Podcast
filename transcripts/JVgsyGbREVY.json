you aware of the aquatic", "25:33", "ape theory nope", "25:34", "it's a very controversial theory but the", "25:38", "theory is that we evolved somehow or", "25:41", "another like you know dolphins",

come out like just like sinewy", "30:01", "no body fat and you throw them in the", "30:03", "water they drown they don't hold their", "30:05", "breath is they don't know what to do", "30:07", "they

and they hold their breath", "30:18", "so this is the that's what that's what", "30:22", "it scientists are basically saying about", "30:24", "free diving Eunice's this is coming when", "30:26", "the first lot sorry when I first learned", "30:28", "about it it completely blew my mind how", "30:31", "long can you hold your breath now I'm", "30:32", "five and a half holy shit but like", "30:35", "facing down on the water and not moving", "30:36", "and preparation not swimming no not", "30:40", "swimming just along a hole if you dive", "30:42", "into the water it's like give you what", "30:44", "how much time do you give yourself it", "30:46", "depends the depth it depends to fish", "30:48", "your hunt depends the conditions it", "30:50", "depends on a lot of things it's like if", "30:51", "you're fighting the water currents it's", "30:53", "more difficult yes because basically", "30:56", "what you want to do when you free dive", "30:57", "is you want to be as calm as possible", "30:59", "you want to be as relaxed as you can", "31:01", "which is why yoga and meditation are", "31:04", "often very close to free diving because", "31:07", "if your heart", "31:08", "is is high then you good body's gonna", "31:11", "need more oxygen mmm that makes sense", "31:15", "obviously and but then again the second", "31:17", "you emerge your face in the water you do", "31:19", "like your first dive and then you feel", "31:20", "the pressure your body understands that", "31:22", "you're trying to to hold your breath and", "31:25", "you need to do that so the blood is", "31:27", "gonna start coming from from your", "31:29", "fingers you extremities your toes and", "31:31", "then your hands you feet so all the", "31:33", "other vessels I was gonna start", "31:36", "constrict so all the blood flow was", "31:38", "gonna go towards your vitals organs so", "31:42", "yeah actually your body is getting ready", "31:43", "for so they want to make sure that the", "31:45", "oxygens goes exactly what needs to be", "31:47", "and make sure that you need as as less", "31:50", "effort to do anything is possible when", "31:52", "you actually underwater now when you", "31:55", "first tried holding your breath how long", "31:57", "did you do it for your first time I did", "31:59", "it yeah I think my first time trying it", "32:02", "was about a minute that was like the", "32:04", "best you could do yeah no techniques", "32:06", "just ready go no no technique like like", "32:09", "they you breathe a little bit before", "32:11", "even with techniques", "32:13", "yeah we're techniques it was it's when", "32:17", "you hold your breath you have the", "32:18", "buildup of co2 in your body because", "32:20", "you're not you know exhaling any mm-hmm", "32:22", "and then when your body realizes that", "32:24", "there's a buildup it gives you an urge", "32:26", "to breathe and then it gives you", "32:28", "contracting contractions like diaphragm", "32:30", "contractions and this is what makes", "32:32", "somebody panics you know like my buddy", "32:34", "need hair and you want everyone here and", "32:36", "then the more you train then you realize", "32:38", "that you're lying under control it and", "32:40", "it's not because you body tell you to", "32:42", "breathe that you necessarily out of", "32:44", "oxygen mmm so how what what techniques", "32:48", "do you do to relax that breeding so I do", "32:52", "mostly especially when I'm in the water", "32:54", "I do a very short inhale so about five", "32:57", "seconds and then I do a long inhale", "33:00", "maybe 10 to 15 seconds and then when you", "33:02", "when you excel you focusing on like", "33:06", "everything getting relaxed and then I'm", "33:08", "sorry say that again because you said", "33:09", "inhale twice oh sorry so you mean - no", "33:11", "so you inhale for five seconds and then", "33:14", "you excel for 10 to 15 seconds okay so", "33:17", "you exhale slowly you exhale super", "33:20", "slowly", "33:21", "to control the air coming out and then", "33:23", "when you do that you get as relaxed as", "33:25", "possible and then the more relaxed you", "33:27", "are that along with your mama'll diving", "33:30", "reflex which is your heart beating slow", "33:32", "down naturally you blood shifting from", "33:34", "extremities to you final organs and then", "33:37", "you also have about a few years ago", "33:41", "maybe only 50 years ago they taught that", "33:43", "when you reach 20 meters your body would", "33:45", "be completely crushed inside that was a", "33:48", "scientist would think 30 meters yeah", "33:50", "something like that that it was like", "33:52", "that the pressure would be so great", "33:54", "there that your body would be completely", "33:55", "crushed but then again with that with", "33:58", "that dive reflex what it does is that", "34:01", "that overflow of blood is going around", "34:03", "you alveoli and your lungs which prevent", "34:05", "dance from crushing your bodies is", "34:08", "actually a design machine to go", "34:11", "underwater which is completely crazy", "34:14", "considering that I've never knew that", "34:17", "especially going up and down town", "34:19", "Montreal you know and then you put", "34:23", "somebody in the water you're like hey", "34:24", "you actually pay for that so when people", "34:25", "tell me yeah I could never do that it's", "34:27", "too hard no no you you're actually born", "34:29", "like that so was it like was it a", "34:32", "revelation for you mean did you really", "34:33", "feel like this is more of Who I am then", "34:36", "then the life that I was living before", "34:38", "100% is I had this I was living in", "34:42", "London too so it was all about all about", "34:45", "you know earning money to buy as many", "34:47", "things as possible to try and impress as", "34:49", "many people as possible and then at some", "34:51", "point I was like wow I I just I cannot", "34:53", "do that I cannot spend in my entire life", "34:56", "just seeking to buy things and press", "35:00", "people I don't like and then when I", "35:02", "started spearfishing it really gave me a", "35:05", "different perspective on life", "35:07", "it gave me them it it humbled me in a", "35:12", "way that was so so intense that it", "35:15", "changed my it changed my way of thinking", "35:16", "completely basically so as I was how did", "35:23", "it humble you like my way because I", "35:25", "realized that when we were let's say", "35:30", "when I'm when I film a documentary and", "35:33", "Safin i from a documentary called aqua", "35:36", "negra and in cape verde two years ago", "35:39", "aqua negra yeah", "35:41", "agua does that mean black water yes in", "35:46", "Portuguese and then we were there for", "35:49", "about five weeks five or six weeks and", "35:50", "then the living conditions were really", "35:52", "bad and there was no grocery stores",

used to", "63:39", "be like when they just the amount of", "63:41", "tuna that these deal with and the amount", "63:43", "they deal with now it's a significant", "63:45", "dip and this is within you know 40 years", "63:48", "like what is it going to be like 40", "63:50", "years from now and the estimates are", "63:52", "that it's going to be a radical decrease", "63:54", "in the population of

so", "64:32", "much money is there there's certain", "64:33", "people in certain countries in", "64:34", "particular where that is all they have I", "64:36", "mean there's certain people out there",

"65:10", "quite a bit of fish but the reality of", "65:13", "things are ships foreign ships raiding", "65:16", "the entire ocean with with nets are like", "65:19", "kilometers long yeah like am i filleted", "65:22", "and that is an a mile long yeah and you", "65:26", "just catch everything you can in it", "65:30", "turtles sharks everything you know and", "65:34", "then it's not it's not they're freaking", "65:36", "Johnson finally that lives in North", "65:38", "Carolina are you catching lobster and", "65:40", "and then then to know that I'm making a", "65:43", "problem you'd have to have some", "65:45", "regulations that were accepted by all", "65:48", "these different countries too and that", "65:49", "would be a real difficult thing to pull", "65:51", "off to get these

happen and so there's nothing left", "66:02", "that's crazy and it's everybody sees it", "66:05", "everybody is talking about it but when", "66:09", "you look at the sheer size of the ocean", "66:11",

"66:21", "to take out of the ocean", "66:23", "it's a lot of fish is there any talk", "66:26", "about doing something about this is", "66:29", "there anything on the table is there any", "66:31",

made", "66:40", "efforts that proved to increase the the", "66:44", "amount of fish or it's good they're", "66:46", "actually working in the right direction", "66:47", "but the problem is that still to this", "66:51", "day I'm not sure exactly how much how", "66:54", "many nautical mile you have to be but a", "66:56", "Russian or Chinese foreigner trawler is", "67:00", "allowed to fish from the

how they", "67:21", "do that the Sea Shepherd's those guys", "67:23", "yeah and then they kill him sell them I", "67:26", "mean it's really fucked up you know", "67:28", "there was this the same exact problem", "67:30", "was going on in the United States in the", "67:32", "1800s", "67:33", "market hunting is what they were calling", "67:35", "it where they devastated all the", "67:38", "wildlife in

on private land the", "67:59", "majority of them but at one point in", "68:01", "time there's millions and millions of", "68:03", "them all throughout the country elk", "68:05", "there they've only been repopulated to a", "68:09", "small percentage of their original range", "68:11", "I think it's something like 30 percent", "68:13", "there's some animals that have thrived", "68:16", "like

"very strange like when you think of", "68:28", "white-tailed deer the places where", "68:30", "they're the most popular that's like", "68:32", "CENTAC law student no that's actually", "68:35", "Ranger that's a caribou yeah caribou are", "68:39", "these migrating deer that live in Canada", "68:42", "primarily and in Alaska and they migrate", "68:45", "for hundreds and hundreds of miles and",

would shoot these things and", "69:20", "bring them to market and people would go", "69:21", "to market and buy that meat and they", "69:22", "would bring it in on trucks I mean I", "69:24", "guess they just have blocks of ice and", "69:26", "these trains and trucks and they would", "69:28", "bring in this meat and they killed", "69:30", "almost everything and it's short amount", "69:32", "of time like less than a hundred years", "69:33", "there was almost nothing left and then", "69:35", "they instituted these laws where it was", "69:37", "illegal to sell wild game so if you buy", "69:40", "elk like say in this country if you buy", "69:43", "elk meat you're buying it from New", "69:44", "Zealand you're getting it it's actually", "69:47", "enforced right now still yeah yeah", "69:48", "there's there are some commercial farms", "69:52", "I don't know what they sell I mean I", "69:54", "think you can sell commercially raised", "69:57", "deer and elk in America but if you go to", "70:00", "a restaurant most of what you're getting", "70:01", "you're actually getting from New Zealand", "70:03", "yeah but you can't go to the woods like", "70:06", "say if you went to the woods and you", "70:07", "went and shot an elk like that one up", "70:09", "there and you try to sell it's illegal", "70:10", "to sell you can't sell that meat it's", "70:13", "not a marketable

populations back and then they had", "70:31", "a enforce these very strict conservation", "70:33", "efforts and then here's the big one is I", "70:36", "think it's called the pikmin Robertson", "70:38", "app whatever the pikmin Robertson is", "70:40", "that it is that's the name of it it what", "70:44", "it is is it takes 10% of all of the", "70:47", "proceeds from hunting supplies and

"77:28", "disease that's spreading amongst deer in", "77:31", "this country and they think a lot of it", "77:34", "is coming or some of it at least is", "77:36", "coming from deer farms they have these", "77:38", "deer farms and all these animals are", "77:39", "getting off the same food than they", "77:41", "scape and then they spread it and then", "77:44", "there's an incubation period and I mean", "77:46", "it exists in the wild and it exists in", "77:48", "deer farms so it's like it's very", "77:50", "complicated but so they have a similar", "77:52", "issue with fish then yeah they do", "77:54", "actually and it's pretty bad but it's", "77:56", "what kind of diseases do they get it's", "78:02", "just I'm gonna be familiar with fish", "78:04", "diseases to be honest but is that term", "78:07", "it's definitely like some fish have", "78:09", "cancer it's bad is what is the term", "78:12", "zoonotic is that the term when it leaves", "78:15", "and makes the jump to humans the", "78:18", "diseases are there any yeah that's what", "78:21", "like avian flu is and swine flu okay", "78:24", "it's a disease that makes it jump to", "78:26", "humans is there any diseases in fish", "78:28", "that make the jump to humans apart from", "78:30", "parasites the only thing you can take", "78:32", "off that you mean can actually get and", "78:34", "parasites are pretty rare with ocean", "78:36", "fish right it's more common with", "78:37", "freshwater fish these worms we can see", "78:40", "warm sometimes but you just discard them", "78:42", "and then this one didn't gonna kill you", "78:43", "they're just gonna take a little funky", "78:45", "yeah", "78:45", "you've eaten worms that came out of fish", "78:48", "for sure right uh most probably I just", "78:51", "probably don't know it when I cut the", "78:53", "fish raw cut it pretty small so I make", "78:55", "sure it is nothing so you look to see", "78:57", "the worms yeah you can see them how much", "78:59", "worm can you get in your body to where", "79:01", "it starts growing take a little slice", "79:04", "I'm not gonna try do you know that no", "79:08", "when you cook the fish they all dead so", "79:11", "that's you if you freeze it that's what", "79:13", "a lot of people freeze their sushi", "79:14", "before eating it yeah they try to do", "79:16", "that with pigs and a lot of animals in", "79:19", "this country too but there's two types", "79:21", "of trichinosis apparently maybe there's", "79:22", "more but there's two very specific kinds", "79:24", "of trichinosis one that if you freeze", "79:27", "it'll die and this is trichinosis that", "79:30", "comes from an animal that's from the", "79:31", "southwest of the United States okay but", "79:33", "then there's trichinosis that comes from", "79:34", "animals that's in the northern", "79:36", "territories and Canada in particular", "79:37", "like it bears Alaska and that stuff you", "79:41", "could freeze it it doesn't matter it", "79:43", "doesn't even kill it when you freeze it", "79:44", "yeah so you have to cook it it has to be", "79:47", "cooked to hunt I think it's 160 degrees", "79:50", "some 147 162 recommended temperature", "79:54", "you have to kill those little fuckers", "79:57", "yeah otherwise you just it just gets in", "80:00", "your muscle tissue have some friends", "80:02", "that caught it's horrific", "80:03", "oh that's bad yeah you like your whole", "80:05", "body's like in pain because it's", "80:07", "literally they're burrowing their way", "80:09", "into your body I don't think you have", "80:11", "something dad bad and fish I mean maybe", "80:14", "that's why I'm skinny who knows it's", "80:20", "probably pretty lean stuff yeah but also", "80:22", "freediving you burn when he goes fishing", "80:25", "you burn about between a thousand and I", "80:27", "think 1,300 calories an hour", "80:29", "what so if you wouldn't lose weight", "80:32", "losing really yeah 1,300 calories an", "80:35", "hour that's incredible it's it's very", "80:37", "very intense wow that's amazing", "80:40", "that's what you would think a lot of", "80:41", "people listen to this like I could eat", "80:43", "so much food", "80:44", "I'll just go freediving but you also", "80:46", "don't eat food which is what's that Jim", "80:48", "the Marshall Islands oh Jesus blow that", "80:52", "thing up we've we've shown that a", "80:53", "million times that's the crazy nuclear", "80:56", "bomb testing area that is the nuttiest", "80:59", "shit ever you see that is miles high", "81:01", "water spraying up into the sky so maybe", "81:04", "the fish are gonna have like three eyes", "81:06", "oh yeah you're gonna have fish they can", "81:08", "read your mind", "81:09", "figured I know you're coming what are", "81:14", "you spearfishing for in the Marshall", "81:15", "Islands I'm not gonna be finishing who's", "81:17", "gonna be visiting yeah so it's kind of", "81:21", "good I have a lot of people asking me", "81:22", "for alternatives and what he can do you", "81:25", "wanna get meat and so this is one of the", "81:28", "possible alternatives of these farms", "81:31", "exactly so I'm gonna check it out and", "81:32", "make sure that it's it's legit and then", "81:34", "is it possible that they could", "81:36", "reintroduce fish into the ocean like", "81:39", "stock the ocean because that's what they", "81:41", "do some Lakes like I used to go fishing", "81:44", "at this lake in Boston and they restock", "81:47", "it every year with rainbow trout yeah", "81:50", "that's actually my my lake when my", "81:53", "parents have a good country how's it do", "81:55", "that too and it works the only problem I", "81:58", "would see with that for like an ocean", "81:59", "fish would be I'm thinking because they", "82:02", "never had predators in captivity that", "82:06", "that maybe in might have a survival", "82:08", "after that but maybe they can learn it I", "82:12", "don't know", "82:13", "yeah the strong and smart survive I mean", "82:16", "you still better that if you know if", "82:18", "there's if they put ten thousands if two", "82:20", "thousand survive it still gets better", "82:21", "yeah yeah I wonder what do would have to", "82:25", "do I want to if it's it's even possible", "82:28", "to restock something as big as the ocean", "82:31", "it's just being fished so quickly and", "82:34", "that's that's that's the biggest problem", "82:36", "but there are solutions it's just people", "82:40", "have to be willing to talk about it and", "82:42", "right now that's the biggest problem", "82:44", "with the same situation as with the Wall", "82:46", "Street Journal when people and trying to", "82:48", "talk about food sourcing and mentioning", "82:51", "alternatives like we don't fish we don't", "82:55", "see food no that's not true and don't", "82:57", "you think that it's the optics though I", "82:58", "mean what they they're concerned with is", "83:00", "not it's not that it's rational it's", "83:03", "that they don't want any controversy", "83:05", "that's what it is so a person like you", "83:08", "although what you're doing is if you", "83:10", "explain it and you look at it", "83:12", "objectively it's very rational but", "83:14", "they're not trying to be rational what", "83:16", "they're trying to do is avoid any", "83:17", "conflict like there was a guy who is a", "83:20", "NASCAR driver okay and he lost a sponsor", "83:24", "recently for some racist stuff that his", "83:27", "father said thirty years ago this is how", "83:31", "crazy people are getting thirty years", "83:33", "ago his father used a racial slur and", "83:38", "because of that this guy who wasn't even", "83:42", "alive when this happened or maybe he was", "83:45", "alive maybe he was seven years old or", "83:47", "some shit he lost a sponsor I mean it's", "83:52", "one of the companies are such cowards", "83:55", "like they're so terrified because of", "83:58", "social media because people are so", "84:00", "willing to protest and there's a bunch", "84:02", "of fuckheads out there that just get a", "84:04", "thrill off of getting people fired and", "84:07", "of getting things canceled and of like", "84:09", "exercising action and seeing a result", "84:13", "all they're doing is pushing buttons", "84:14", "it's not that they've thought about this", "84:16", "and like hey is this guy really", "84:18", "responsible should we really blame him", "84:20", "for something his father did", "84:22", "thirty years ago that's ridiculous what", "84:24", "we should do is nothing just let it go I", "84:27", "mean unless this guy is like some sort", "84:29", "of white supremacist or some racist", "84:32", "himself yeah and he's not we should just", "84:35", "do nothing but that's not that doesn't", "84:37", "that's not fun what's fun is getting a", "84:40", "rush a power trip out of action like", "84:43", "clearly there should like if you find a", "84:44", "real racist something someone who's", "84:46", "doing something actively to harm other", "84:49", "people simply based on their ethnic", "84:52", "origin or the color of their skin yeah", "84:54", "that's terrible you should talk out", "84:56", "about that that should be eliminated", "84:57", "from our society real real racism but", "85:01", "that's not what this is what this is is", "85:02", "people deciding that they're they're", "85:05", "going to take action and then NASCAR", "85:07", "being a pussy about it or this company", "85:10", "being a pussy about it and that's the", "85:12", "same thing that's happening with you", "85:13", "it's not this is not a rational decision", "85:16", "like they should look at it and go wow", "85:18", "what an interesting way to get your fish", "85:20", "like how many these people that made", "85:21", "this decision actually eat fish I'll bet", "85:24", "it's most I bet it's most people should", "85:27", "understand also that by refraining", "85:29", "people to talk about it you're being", "85:33", "part of the problem yes this is why", "85:35", "things have been so bad for so many", "85:37", "years because nobody wants to talk about", "85:39", "it they all want to eat it they just", "85:42", "don't want to know where it's from but", "85:43", "no one's looking at things long-term all", "85:45", "they're looking at isn't potential", "85:47", "short-term income loss so with the Wall", "85:49", "Street Journal or the Washington Post or", "85:51", "whatever whatever paper it is what", "85:54", "they're worried about they're worried", "85:55", "that someone's going to come along and", "85:56", "say the Wall Street Journal support was", "85:59", "a Wall Street Journal yeah The Wall", "86:01", "Street Journal supports a mass", "86:05", "extinction of fish they just reframe it", "86:07", "in some outrageous unrealistic", "86:10", "non accurate way what people need to", "86:13", "chill out you I think like I understand", "86:15", "I understand when it come from and the", "86:17", "sense that especially like the", "86:20", "Millennials or whatever we're all born", "86:22", "when you know

a pole spear she wasn't in a gun and", "122:10", "I missed it and I started shooting in", "122:12", "the water and then I miss it again I was", "122:14", "like god damn it and then I realized it", "122:15", "was like whoa I'm actually pretty deep", "122:17", "in him I've been there for quite a while", "122:18", "so I started panicking a little bit so", "122:21", "when you panic you let air even more", "122:23", "which is completely stupid and then I", "122:25", "started finding finding finning and then", "122:26", "you have you start doing nothing", "122:29", "so finding Yang's waning finning", "122:34", "whenever you have your work fins mmhmm", "122:39", "yeah exactly and then what happens first", "122:43", "before you black out is you have a loss", "122:44", "of motor control so I could start", "122:48", "feeling I could feel like my body making", "122:50", "like weird movements and then I knew", "122:51", "that I was out of oxygen and then I knew", "122:53", "that I would probably most probably", "122:55", "going to pass up and then I came back", "122:57", "and came back and the nice lot of my", "122:58", "friend I was watching and I was like I", "123:00", "really hope you watching me hope you're", "123:01", "really watching and he grabbed me and he", "123:04", "woke me up and it was how far were you", "123:06", "from the surface and you blacked out I", "123:08", "blacked out a surface", "123:09", "Oh at the surface yes which is why it's", "123:11", "called a shallow water blackout because", "123:13", "even if you're in deeper water it most", "123:15", "of the time happens at the surface so", "123:17", "when you got to the surface what did you", "123:19", "have to do to wake you up you have to", "123:21", "take the mask off you have to keep the", "123:23", "head off the water and then you have to", "123:25", "blow in the ice because you have a high", "123:26", "concentration of nerves you slap a", "123:28", "little bit not too hard", "123:29", "[Laughter]", "123:31", "named and then you don't really wake up", "123:33", "pretty pretty fast unless you inhale", "123:35", "water", "123:35", "what did you was it like you had a dream", "123:38", "like if you get choked out like one of", "123:40", "the things that happens when you get", "123:41", "choked out as you wake up it's like", "123:43", "you're dreaming like what whoa I was at", "123:45", "a disco", "123:48", "I was riding my skateboard like it's", "123:50", "weird I've never been choked out to the", "123:52", "point of passing out I would imagine so", "123:56", "luckily for me but yeah I missed out", "123:59", "long in a few a few minutes and I just", "124:01", "wasn't sure what's going on and then you", "124:03", "just you just done for the day when it", "124:04", "happened it's been yeah you have to be", "124:06", "done huh it's yeah for the the risk of", "124:09", "getting another one the same day it's", "124:10", "actually very high Wow", "124:12", "so once you shut off you get shut off", "124:14", "again yeah so you have to wait at least", "124:16", "a following day to get back and I'll", "124:17", "jump back in the next day I think I did", "124:21", "it was the day after I really want to go", "124:22", "back into water as soon as possible just", "124:24", "to jump back on the horse yeah so at", "124:26", "night I was a little bit stressed out", "124:28", "and my friend gave me some kratom and it", "124:30", "was fun oh that's I think that stuff", "124:35", "that kratom was I didn't think it was a", "124:40", "drug I thought it was a mild stimulant I", "124:44", "heard that people take it for pain but I", "124:46", "thought that when they're taking it for", "124:48", "pain that they're not getting high", "124:50", "they're just taking and it alleviates", "124:52", "pain like Advil or something like that", "124:54", "and then I took I think I took eight of", "124:57", "them eight or ten which is a lot because", "125:00", "I know Chris Bell takes like ten always", "125:02", "like it's a pill yeah okay I took it in", "125:05", "powder it makes with like yeah this is", "125:07", "just the powder in pill form and I was", "125:09", "high as fuck oh okay now I know why", "125:14", "people are nervous about this stuff I", "125:16", "mean but the weird thing is I was high", "125:18", "but my body was very functional like I", "125:22", "was high but I wasn't uncoordinated I", "125:24", "wasn't like knocking things over it", "125:27", "wasn't that everything worked normal", "125:29", "like everything was was moving and as I", "125:31", "wanted it to move but I was like whoa it", "125:37", "is an opiate it operates on your opiate", "125:40", "receptors in some sort of strange way", "125:41", "which is one of the reasons why they're", "125:43", "making the argument that it should be", "125:44", "illegal but is if any opiate is legal it", "125:48", "should be that one because it helps", "125:51", "people tremendously with addiction", "125:52", "tremendously with pain it doesn't seem", "125:54", "to be toxic to the point where it can", "125:56", "kill you or it's very very rare that it", "126:00", "does it's", "126:01", "to operate in a completely different way", "126:03", "than any other opiate and like I said", "126:04", "even though I was definitely high like I", "126:07", "was definitely under the influence of", "126:09", "something nobody I don't think anybody", "126:11", "knew I mean I could have conversations", "126:12", "with people but in the back of my house", "126:17", "but I'm talking to people and it was all", "126:19", "totally normal", "126:20", "I wasn't driving but if I was driving I", "126:22", "think I'd be fine I'm fine I was fine", "126:24", "walk I think even worked out yeah it's", "126:28", "just it's just operates in a very", "126:30", "different way it's um I've never I mean", "126:33", "I've had my knee operation I had one of", "126:37", "my knee operations they gave me a", "126:39", "morphine button like when I was in the", "126:41", "hospital like they said if you want more", "126:44", "if we can just press that button it'll", "126:45", "give you some morphine", "126:50", "what's he once you get high off the", "126:53", "morphine you're in the hospital it was", "126:54", "great", "126:55", "keep pressing the button in the pain of", "126:57", "the knees it was on also my knee was on", "127:00", "this motion machine right after the the", "127:03", "surgery was done they put me on this", "127:05", "machine that extends and contracts your", "127:07", "name okay yeah brings it back and forth", "127:09", "and that's not comfortable but when you", "127:11", "hit that morphine pad right that's fun", "127:13", "but other than that I never really have", "127:15", "had opiates I don't think except they", "127:19", "gave me a pain pill prescription I don't", "127:21", "remember what kind it was it was vicodin", "127:23", "our percocets or one of those I took it", "127:26", "once and I hated it it just made me feel", "127:28", "really stupid I think I just remember", "127:31", "thinking my brains just really dull and", "127:33", "I still could feel the pain I just", "127:35", "didn't care it was weird you know", "127:37", "so those morphine buttons are very", "127:39", "dangerous when I got my operation I was", "127:41", "I keep pressing the button seems pretty", "127:43", "fun yeah well it's time to go home and I", "127:46", "stood up and I fell right on my face I", "127:49", "had a complete faceplant really yeah", "127:51", "like an actually complete faceplant Oh", "127:53", "what were you in the hospital for I was", "127:55", "a vernian", "127:57", "hernia yeah and they didn't ask you like", "128:00", "how many times you press that button", "128:02", "Valentine it is they definitely didn't", "128:04", "seem to have taking into consideration", "128:05", "my weight oh yeah right why wouldn't", "128:10", "they ask you how many times you press", "128:11", "the button before they let you get up I", "128:13", "but I remembered a woman being like", "128:15", "didn't there's being like like you had", "128:17", "you had a law you sure you want more you", "128:19", "shoot that much it was like bringing it", "128:24", "what you're under the influence of it I", "128:27", "imagine you
