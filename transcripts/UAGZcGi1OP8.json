eight years of social media and", "04:08", "then all of a sudden they figured out", "04:10", "how to game this system", "04:12", "and then they figured out how to use", "04:14", "this to", "04:15",

this kind of", "04:47", "consolidation as", "04:49", "social platforms kind of came into", "04:50", "existence content creators were really", "04:53", "excited about the fact that now they not",

more", "05:02", "pronounced more and more people came to", "05:04", "be on social platforms", "05:06", "and it originally wasn't even facebook", "05:07", "if you remember it was like you know", "05:08", "there's like friendster and myspace and", "05:10", "social networks kind of evolved when i", "05:12", "was in college facebook was still", "05:14", "limited to like you know a handful of",

"05:33", "there's a kind of mass consolidation of", "05:35", "audiences onto this handful of platforms", "05:36", "so this becomes really interesting for", "05:38", "regular people who just want to", "05:40", "find their friends reach people spread", "05:43", "their message", "05:44", "grow an audience it also becomes really", "05:46", "interesting for propagandists and trolls", "05:48", "and in this case terrorist organizations", "05:50", "and state intelligence services", "05:52", "because instead of reaching the entire", "05:54", "internet they really just kind of have", "05:55", "to concentrate their efforts on a", "05:56", "handful of platforms", "05:58", "so that consolidation is one of the", "06:00", "things that kind of kicks off", "06:01", "some of the um one of the reasons that", "06:04", "we have these problems today", "06:05", "right so the fact that there's only a", "06:07", "facebook a twitter", "06:08", "and instagram and a couple other minor", "06:11", "platforms", "06:12", "other than youtube i mean anything that", "06:14", "you can tell it's an actual person", "06:17", "like youtube is a problem right because", "06:18", "you can see it's an actual person if", "06:20", "you're", "06:20", "if you're narrating something you you", "06:23", "know if you're", "06:23", "in front of the camera and explaining", "06:25", "things people are", "06:27",

little online", "06:36", "beefs with each other", "06:37", "and then i'll go to some of these", "06:38", "accounts like this doesn't seem like a", "06:39", "real person and i'll go and it's like", "06:40", "hashtag", "06:41", "magga there's a american eagle in front", "06:44", "of a flag", "06:45", "and then you you read their stuff and", "06:47", "like wow this is this is", "06:48", "probably a russian troll account and", "06:50", "it's strange", "06:52", "like you feel like you're not supposed", "06:53", "to be seeing this like you're seeing the", "06:54", "wiring under the board or something and", "06:56", "then you'll go through the timeline", "06:58", "and all they're doing is engaging people", "07:00", "and", "07:01", "arguing you know for trump and against", "07:05", "you know whatever the fuck they're angry", "07:07", "about whatever whatever it is that's", "07:08", "being discussed", "07:09", "and they're they're basically just like", "07:11", "some weird little argument mechanism", "07:14", "yeah so in 2016 um", "07:17", "there was a lot of that during the", "07:18", "presidential campaign right and there", "07:20", "were", "07:21", "um there was so much that was written", "07:23", "you know we can go back to the free", "07:25", "speech thing we were kind of chatting", "07:26", "about before", "07:26", "there was so much that was written about",

that is just real", "07:36", "americans right there are plenty of", "07:38", "people who are just assholes on the", "07:39", "internet sure", "07:40", "um but there were actually a fair number",

you see some of these", "08:47", "accounts pivot to targeting americans", "08:49", "and so in 20 late 2014 early 2015 you", "08:52", "start to see the", "08:54", "um this strategy that for a long time", "08:57", "had been very inwardly focused making", "08:59", "their own people think a certain way or", "09:00", "feel a certain way or have a certain", "09:02", "experience on the internet it begins to", "09:04", "to spread out it begins to to look", "09:06", "outwards and so you start to see these", "09:08", "accounts", "09:09", "communicating with americans and as we", "09:12", "were going through the data sets which", "09:14", "the twitter data set is public anyone", "09:15", "can go and look at it at this point", "09:17", "you do see some of the accounts that are", "09:19",

that's it yeah so if", "10:06", "they do that", "10:07", "they can kind of do that as long as they", "10:09", "want they can continue to make", "10:11", "new accounts and it probably also", "10:15", "emboldens the actual amer", "10:17", "because they're going to go out a little", "10:20", "bit further than everybody else a little", "10:21", "bit crazier and it kind of changes the", "10:23",

people are", "10:41", "interacting with each other and to make", "10:43", "it", "10:43", "just make it more more vicious yeah so", "10:46", "the what they're doing is they're", "10:48", "operating in communities so one of the", "10:50", "really common criticisms of you know", "10:52", "people who", "10:53", "um a lot of people think that this", "10:55", "didn't have a huge impact didn't you",

that's", "11:05", "where you see", "11:06", "um it's it's i mean i think everybody's", "11:09", "probably had this experience you're part", "11:10", "of a group and then a new person gets", "11:12",

particular", "11:31", "ways of communicating that", "11:33", "maybe a group wouldn't naturally", "11:34", "gravitate to but then it does", "11:36", "so there are definitely ways in which", "11:40",

following and then all of a sudden", "24:16", "something will get political", "24:18", "and i'll look at it and go oh wow like", "24:21", "this is probably one of those weird", "24:23", "accounts",

think one of the challenges is like", "24:47", "you want people to be aware that this", "24:48", "stuff exists but you don't want them to", "24:49", "be paranoid that it's everywhere", "24:51", "i am personal i know that's a problem", "24:54", "everybody's into control now", "24:56", "i look at this all day long and", "24:58", "sometimes i see things and i'm like", "25:00", "you know what are the

out", "25:18", "the flip side of that is you do wind up", "25:20", "in these weird you know you see it", "25:21", "happen on social media now or", "25:23", "um click into a trump tweet and you'll", "25:25", "see like you're a russian bot no you're", "25:26", "a russian bot no you're", "25:29", "like they're probably not russian bots", "25:30", "you know it's everybody you don't like", "25:32",

after the fact it", "25:53", "leaves you a little bit", "25:54", "off balance right feel like um you know", "25:59", "when you feel like you can't quite tell", "26:02", "what's real", "26:03", "and

so", "26:13", "in some ways there's not much downside", "26:15", "to doing this", "26:16", "right because you do you know if you", "26:19", "either knock it out of the park and you", "26:20",

you want the platforms to", "79:34", "do", "79:35", "and when we were having this", "79:36", "conversation about isis there was", "79:38", "a um not insignificant collection of", "79:42", "voices",

code", "82:25", "i mean i look at my mentions i mean on", "82:27", "any given day especially", "82:29", "like yesterday i had um a vaccine", "82:32", "proponent yeah i watched it yeah", "82:34", "yeah peter's great and and you know and", "82:36", "it seemed like what", "82:38", "was really disturbing to me was like the", "82:39", "vast majority of the comments were about", "82:41", "vaccines and so few about", "82:44", "these unchecked diseases that are", "82:47", "running rampant in poor communities", "82:48", "which was the most disturbing aspect of", "82:50", "the conversation to me",

mentions are going", "83:09", "to be interesting but well they're going", "83:10", "to be a disaster today", "83:11", "i know i know um well let me let me", "83:16", "i think that one of the challenges for", "83:19", "the platforms", "83:20", "is a lot of things start out like learn", "83:22", "to code i remember i", "83:23", "watched that play out um covington", "83:26", "catholic was another thing that", "83:27", "i mean god um would learn to code there", "83:31", "was", "83:31", "some of the people who were trolling and", "83:33", "just saying learn to code and you know", "83:35", "whatever you don't have a right to not", "83:36", "be offended", "83:37", "but then there was the um the other", "83:39", "accounts that kind of took it that step", "83:41", "further and began to throw in like the", "83:43", "ovens and the other stuff", "83:44", "yeah learn to code right and that's one", "83:47", "of the challenges with the platform", "83:48", "which is", "83:49", "if you're trying to assess", "83:53", "the um", "83:56", "just the content itself like if you", "83:58", "start doing keyword bands", "84:00", "right you're going to catch a lot of", "84:01", "shit that you don't want to catch", "84:03", "but the flip side is if you", "84:06", "you know the this is the challenge of", "84:08", "moderating at scale which is", "84:10", "um where you know what what side do you", "84:13", "come down on do you come down on saying", "84:14", "like", "84:15", "75 percent of people with hashtag learn", "84:17", "to code are just", "84:18", "you know um not doing anything", "84:22", "incredibly offensive and then the 25 who", "84:24", "are they really change the tone of the", "84:26", "overall campaign and the hashtag", "84:29", "for the entire community and that's", "84:30", "where you see twitter i think come in", "84:32", "with the", "84:32", "more heavy-handed and just shut it down", "84:35", "kind of thing", "84:37", "i don't i don't know that there's an", "84:39", "easy answer i think that", "84:40", "we are you know even today what was the", "84:43", "latest kerfuffle elizabeth warren got", "84:45", "an ad taken down on facebook and then", "84:47", "there was a whole conversation about was", "84:48", "facebook", "84:50", "censoring elizabeth warren i i", "84:51", "personally didn't think that it read", "84:52", "like censorship", "84:53", "what was the ad about it was um it was", "84:56", "an ad about", "84:57", "funny enough her uh platform to break up", "84:59", "facebook whoa", "85:00", "so facebook take that down like yeah", "85:03", "listen", "85:05", "it sort of read more like a cell phone", "85:07", "like she had a picture of facebook's", "85:09", "logo in the", "85:10", "um in the uh image and there that", "85:13", "violates the ads terms of service", "85:15", "and the reason behind that is actually", "85:17", "because uh facebook doesn't want", "85:19", "people putting up ads that have the", "85:20", "facebook logo in it because that's how", "85:22", "you scam people right that's a great way", "85:23", "to", "85:24", "to rip people off and so probably just", "85:26", "like an automated", "85:27", "um you know an automated takedown like", "85:29", "an automated like it halts the ad you", "85:31", "have to go and make some changes and", "85:32", "then you can push the ad back out again", "85:34", "uh but it just happens at a time when", "85:36", "there's like so little assumption of", "85:37", "good faith and so little assumption of", "85:40", "um such extreme", "85:43", "uh anger and polarization and um you", "85:46", "know", "85:46", "assumption that um the platforms are", "85:49", "censoring with with every little", "85:51", "kind of moderation snafu that it it", "85:54", "makes it", "85:54", "i think i don't know how we have the", "85:57", "conversation in a way that's", "85:59", "healthy and looks towards solutions as", "86:01", "opposed to", "86:03", "the left screaming that it censored the", "86:04", "right screaming that it's censored the", "86:07", "um you know trying to get around how do", "86:10", "we both moderate and not moderate which", "86:11", "is a", "86:12", "tough position to be in um i think", "86:17", "yeah i don't have any good no one does", "86:19", "that's part of the issue and vigil", "86:21", "discussed that pretty much in depth what", "86:23", "she was saying this is", "86:25", "about moderating in scale when you're", "86:27", "talking about", "86:28", "millions and millions and millions of", "86:31", "posts", "86:32", "and a couple thousand people working for", "86:33", "the organization", "86:35", "and then algorithms and computer", "86:36", "learning that's trying to keep up and", "86:38", "that's where things like learn to code", "86:40", "and people are so outraged and pissed", "86:42", "off because", "86:43", "when they do get banned they feel like", "86:45", "they've been targeted well you really", "86:46", "just", "86:46", "ran into some code and then it's really", "86:50", "hard to get someone to pay attention to", "86:51", "your appeal", "86:52", "right because there's not enough people", "86:54", "that are looking at these appeals and", "86:56", "there's", "86:57", "probably millions of appeals every day", "86:59", "it's almost impossible", "87:01", "yeah and there's you know depending on", "87:03", "which um which side you're on you also", "87:05", "hear like", "87:06", "um this person is harassing me and i'm", "87:08", "demanding moderation and nobody's doing", "87:10", "anything about it", "87:11", "yes uh so it's it's definitely i think", "87:14", "gotten worse um", "87:18", "it's it's interesting to look back at", "87:21", "2016 and wonder how much of the", "87:24", "um where we are now is in part because", "87:28", "not a whole lot happened in 2016 and", "87:30", "2016 it was or 2015 in particular", "87:32", "very light like almost no moderation", "87:34", "just kind of let it all", "87:35", "hang out there and i i look at it", "87:39", "i look at it now particularly as it", "87:40", "evolves into this conversation about", "87:41", "free speech public squares", "87:44", "um and what the new kind of", "87:47", "infrastructure for speech", "87:49", "and what rights um we should expect on", "87:52", "it", "87:53", "it's a really tough", "87:58", "um", "88:00", "you know i think some of it is is almost", "88:02", "like the people who are", "88:04", "who hear the words free speech and they", "88:06", "just assume that it's people asking for", "88:08", "carte blanche right to harass", "88:10", "and saying you know um how do we balance", "88:13", "that you know i think jack and vijaya", "88:15", "were saying this on your show", "88:16", "um how do we maximize the number of", "88:18", "people who are involved make sure that", "88:20", "all voices do get heard", "88:22", "without being unnecessarily heavy-handed", "88:25", "and moderating", "88:26", "a thought or content and instead", "88:29", "moderate behavior", "88:31", "and instead moderate", "88:34", "particular types of signatures of things", "88:37", "that are inauthentic or things that are", "88:39", "coordinated and looking at", "88:40", "this again gets to disinformation too", "88:42", "rather than trying to police", "88:44", "disinformation by looking at", "88:46", "content really looking instead at", "88:48", "actions and behavior and account", "88:50", "authenticity and dissemination patterns", "88:52", "because a lot of the worst trolls and", "88:53", "stuff are just using these throwaway", "88:54", "accounts and then they", "88:56", "yeah disappear well i", "88:59", "have the impression myself that when", "89:01", "we're talking about", "89:03", "censorship we're talking about", "89:05", "moderating content that", "89:06", "really we're talking about this current", "89:09", "era", "89:09", "and that what's coming is essentially", "89:12", "we're like putting up a small", "89:15", "like twig fence and a herd of stampeding", "89:19", "buffaloes on the way", "89:20", "in terms of the the more", "89:24", "invasive or the more", "89:27", "the more potent levels of technology", "89:31", "that are on the way", "89:32", "i just feel like i feel like we're", "89:35", "everything is moving in a very specific", "89:36", "direction and that very specific", "89:38", "direction", "89:39", "is less boundaries between people and", "89:42", "information and that includes", "89:43", "communication", "89:44", "and it's going to be insanely impossible", "89:47", "insanely difficult or nearly impossible", "89:49", "to to moderate", "89:51", "in 10 years i just don't think i don't", "89:53", "think that's going to be", "89:54", "i don't think it's going to be in the", "89:55", "wheelhouse i just i think it's going to", "89:58", "we're entering into some weird place", "90:00", "where we're either going to have to", "90:01", "stay off of social media because it's", "90:04", "just too toxic", "90:05", "or grow a thick skin and just be able to", "90:07", "deal with anything", "90:08", "and then if that's the case how are we", "90:11", "going to be able to differentiate", "90:12", "between things that are particularly", "90:13", "designed", "90:14", "to to manipulate us specifically", "90:16", "designed to manipulate us and change our", "90:18", "opinions", "90:19", "by foreign entities like this you know", "90:22", "this russian troll farm i do think the", "90:26", "the you know when i think about like", "90:29", "so we believe that disinformation is", "90:32", "in part facilitated by gameable", "90:34", "algorithms consolidation", "90:36", "and then the targeting the kind of", "90:38", "things we've talked about through this", "90:39", "conversation", "90:41", "then i think that the algorithms piece", "90:44", "the manipulatable algorithms that's", "90:46", "really squarely", "90:47", "the responsibility of the platforms i", "90:49", "don't think that there's any regulation", "90:51", "or", "90:52", "um you know any kind of framework that's", "90:54", "going to come from congress that's going", "90:55", "to", "90:56", "address that well that was pretty clear", "90:58", "from the facebook hearings right i mean", "90:59", "they barely", "91:01", "android phone and an iphone they they", "91:04", "really don't know what's going on", "91:05", "tim apple yeah that's the king of the", "91:08", "world", "91:12", "he says he did that on purpose which is", "91:13", "even more hilarious", "91:15", "just say you fucked up man i mean to say", "91:18", "that you", "91:18", "knew tim cook his real name wasn't tim", "91:21", "apple", "91:22", "i think that dude it is funny he called", "91:24", "him to apple though", "91:25", "i did i appreciated the rest of like", "91:27", "every ceo in silicon valley changing", "91:28", "their twitter channel afterwards yeah", "91:30", "that was funny", "91:31", "but i think the uh which i just left my", "91:33", "train of thought on that too", "91:34", "sorry we're talking about you you were", "91:37", "talking about", "91:38", "them oh yeah regular gaming algorithms", "91:40", "regulating yeah", "91:42", "so i i think that ultimately the", "91:45", "algorithmic piece does remain squarely", "91:47", "in the purview of the platforms and", "91:48", "that's because", "91:50", "it's an arms race right as they change", "91:51", "their algorithm a little bit tweak it", "91:53", "for the product function", "91:55", "which they just do in their roles", "91:56", "business", "91:58", "there is no regulation that's going to", "91:59", "come down fast enough to catch that", "92:01", "i think actually finance is an", "92:03", "interesting parallel here", "92:04", "because like in the financial markets", "92:06", "there are these multi-tiered levels of", "92:08", "regulation and oversight so that there's", "92:10", "always some", "92:11", "entity responsible whether it's the", "92:13", "exchange or a self-regulatory", "92:15", "organization", "92:15", "or the government the sec looking to see", "92:18", "if like", "92:19", "information integrity in the markets is", "92:22", "being maintained right there's no", "92:24", "shitty algorithm coming in to manipulate", "92:27", "people", "92:28", "it's just making sure that we have that", "92:29", "level of trust so i think that right now", "92:31", "the tech ecosystem is lacking regulation", "92:33", "in", "92:34", "all of its forms so that will likely", "92:36", "change", "92:37", "but the argument for decentralization", "92:40", "is i don't know how you execute it i the", "92:43", "antitrust thing in particular as it", "92:45", "as it comes up so much more now um", "92:47", "excuse me i don't know under what", "92:50", "economic grounds you make that claim", "92:52", "that's way outside of", "92:54", "of my wheelhouse in my area but there is", "92:57", "something to be said for this you know", "92:59", "return to", "93:00", "decentralization in some way i feel like", "93:02", "it lets people have what they want", "93:05", "um it lets you you know reddit's a great", "93:08", "example you have these um", "93:10", "it's almost like federalism you have", "93:11", "this central platform but then you have", "93:13", "these little", "93:14", "communities under it and each community", "93:16", "has its own norms", "93:17", "each community has its own rules nobody", "93:20", "who violates the", "93:22", "moderator rules in a reddit and screams", "93:24", "censorship is really taken seriously", "93:26", "right this is the rules of the community", "93:28", "you're in the community there you go", "93:29", "and this was how um in the olden days of", "93:31", "the internet like use nets and things", "93:33", "you would have", "93:33", "this is the community that you've chosen", "93:35", "to be a part of if you don't like the", "93:37", "moderation standards you go to this", "93:38", "other community", "93:39", "right i think the concern with", "93:40", "consolidation is that", "93:43", "people who do get moderated away feel", "93:45", "like there's nowhere for them to go", "93:48", "that they've lost access to the entire", "93:51", "world", "93:51", "um so i think if you have that", "93:55", "decentralization", "93:56", "it in some ways um it", "94:00", "it it stops being quite so much of a", "94:03", "freedom of speech", "94:04", "issue if you can't speak on you know", "94:07", "if you if everything is like if there's", "94:10", "50 different platforms and you", "94:12", "fall foul of some sort of norms or", "94:13", "standards or community", "94:15", "membership in this one you can go over", "94:17", "here to this other one right", "94:18", "then the idea that somebody has", "94:20", "moderated you away or de-platformed you", "94:21", "or something is much less", "94:24", "um potent maybe if they're alternating", "94:27", "though if you dock someone or something", "94:29", "along those lines yeah", "94:30", "they're still like again", "94:33", "moderation at the lower levels versus um", "94:37", "kind of top level like you're summarily", "94:39", "booted off yeah that seems like the best", "94:41", "approach right like it seems like the", "94:43", "best approach is to sort of", "94:45", "let these communities sort of establish", "94:46", "themselves but even inside those", "94:48", "communities then you have people that", "94:49", "gain", "94:50", "power through moderation and they start", "94:53", "abusing it and then it becomes some sort", "94:54", "of a weird hierarchy", "94:57", "it's like the decentralization", "95:01", "in general is probably the right move", "95:04", "for all this stuff", "95:05", "but how does that happen with something", "95:08", "like facebook or twitter without", "95:09", "government intervention", "95:11", "and i you know that's one of the things", "95:13", "that tim poole was bringing up like", "95:15", "if you guys don't do this we don't", "95:17", "handle this", "95:18", "it's entirely possible somewhere down", "95:20", "the line you're going to be regulated by", "95:21", "the government do you really want that", "95:23", "i think that that's an inevitability", "95:24", "whether they think so yeah at this point", "95:26", "yeah", "95:26", "what do you think is going to
