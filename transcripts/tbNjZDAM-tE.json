saw that", "19:47", "marijuana made them change their opinion", "19:49", "on doing other drugs because a lot of", "19:51", "these people are just doing drugs yeah", "19:53", "and they do Merrill", "19:54", "as well say look we've showed through", "19:57", "these through these epidemiology studies", "19:59", "that marijuana is a gateway drug because", "20:01", "they started smoking marijuana and

smoke marijuana but", "21:58", "the point is marijuana doesn't kill you", "22:01", "it's really that simple now if you're", "22:03", "saying that marijuana causes you to do", "22:05", "all sorts of other things you've got to", "22:06", "have some direct", "22:07", "pathway yeah that shows that it changes", "22:10", "your inhibitions it changes the way you", "22:11", "think about things that's

had a", "22:31", "great fucking time", "22:32", "that is the disinformation aspect of it", "22:36", "is more dangerous than the idea that", "22:38", "it's a cape some sort of a gateway I", "22:40", "agree with all of that now I wanted to", "22:43", "pounce when he said that but you have to", "22:44", "understand this was his Town Hall so I", "22:47", "knew that I was first of all I was gonna", "22:49", "be shoved to the side very quickly", "22:50", "anyway because there was a whole big", "22:51", "line behind me I'd be wrong about people", "22:53", "clapping they might have really said it", "22:56", "was wrong I'm sure some of the people in", "22:57", "the room were there to see him and", "22:59", "they'd agree with him because it was his", "23:00", "Town Hall but I wanted a pounce but I", "23:03", "knew I can't really go back and forth", "23:05", "like it's a debate so what I did is", "23:06", "whenever I knew I could interject just a", "23:09", "little bit I pushed him on it and you're", "23:11", "gonna see that in a weird background", "23:12", "with like a bird", "24:58", "so he actually changed his position", "25:01", "slightly because when he ran for", "25:03", "president he said not only am i against", "25:05", "marijuana being legal at a federal level", "25:07", "I wouldn't even let the individual", "25:09", "states decide whether or not they want", "25:11", "legal marijuana so in other words he", "25:13", "would prosecute the states like Colorado", "25:15", "and California that have legal marijuana", "25:16", "using federal law and right there he", "25:19", "softened his position slightly and he", "25:21", "said well leave it up to the states and", "25:22", "let them decide so don't you think", "25:24", "that's because he knows he'll never be", "25:25", "President no I think he still wants to", "25:27", "be President there's no fucking way I", "25:29", "think he's gonna run again no I don't", "25:31", "know if he's gonna run in 2020 but 2024", "25:33", "first of all the odds of that guy's", "25:36", "gonna make it eight more years with that", "25:39", "FairPoint morbidly obese carcass he's", "25:42", "moving his band around with didn't he", "25:45", "get a stapler did he get his stomach", "25:48", "fuckin suit you know somebody pointed", "25:50", "that out I didn't know that I never saw", "25:52", "those stories I'm not denying that it's", "25:54", "true but I just never heard it but if he", "25:56", "did didn't work well I had a friend who", "25:58", "ate through two of those he", "26:01", "when you're a date that's what I'm", "26:02", "saying anyway about food he's addicted", "26:04", "to food that's like this is", "26:06", "unquestionably he's an addict do you", "26:09", "think nobody said that to him in his", "26:11", "life or no look look how much thinner", "26:12", "you got okay okay and he did this oh I", "26:14", "guess he did this before the", "26:15", "presidential race because he wanted to", "26:17", "mm make it but then he got fat again", "26:20", "yeah mm-hmm so he was rotund before he", "26:24", "was like a bag of water before and then", "26:28", "you know he he trimmed himself down yeah", "26:31", "and it's funny because I don't think in", "26:33", "any way he realizes the hypocrisy of", "26:35", "having his own you know issue with food", "26:38", "and he would argue hey man listen how", "26:40", "many would I want it's a freedom choice", "26:42", "when it comes to freedom for somebody to", "26:44", "decide to tweak their consciousness", "26:45", "slightly all of a sudden he says you", "26:47", "shouldn't be allowed to do that well", "26:48", "that's where it's preposterous the idea", "26:50", "that you mean even with what he said", "26:52", "about alcohol didn't make any sense like", "26:54", "would you mean alcohol illegal well we", "26:56", "tried already it's called prohibition", "26:57", "okay but let's pretend that you had some", "27:00", "sort of an ability to keep that from you", "27:03", "know going sideways again let's start", "27:06", "from the beginning would you want", "27:08", "alcohol to be legal or not if you could", "27:10", "wave your hand and there would be no", "27:12", "more problems that are alcohol", "27:14", "associated would you do that and make it", "27:16", "illegal versus give a grown adult the", "27:21", "possibility of deciding whether or not", "27:24", "they want to drink or not drink yeah", "27:26", "he's not being consistent in his logic", "27:27", "that's the point is that he's willing to", "27:29", "say I'm thinking about Donuts but he", "27:31", "even he even mentioned prohibition there", "27:34", "but that makes my point not his point", "27:36", "yes because that's when the Mafia got", "27:37", "incredibly powerful because you pushed", "27:39", "all the alcohol sales underground and", "27:41", "they got all the power and the money as", "27:42", "a result of it and that's when crime has", "27:44", "shot through the roof so if you want to", "27:46", "decrease violent crime and the drug war", "27:48", "yeah I mean look talk to people in", "27:50", "Mexico I mean the United States and our", "27:54", "hunger for illegal drugs is a reason why", "27:57", "the cartel got so huge yeah when we were", "27:59", "kids when I was in high school there was", "28:02", "no Mexican cartel yeah it was never", "28:04", "discussed it was not an issue there was", "28:07", "no discussion whatsoever about violence", "28:10", "from Mexico that is an incredibly recent", "28:14", "thing", "28:14", "in fact I did MTV Spring Break I want to", "28:20", "say it was back in 2002 I was hosting", "28:26", "this Spring Break thing for MTV when", "28:28", "Fear Factor was just on the air and it", "28:31", "was like one of those publicity things", "28:33", "that we did and there was no worries", "28:36", "about going to Mexico Mexico back then", "28:38", "was nothing it was just like hey we're", "28:40", "going to Mexico", "28:41", "okay cool it's like hey we're gonna go", "28:42", "to New Mexico was no different yeah you", "28:45", "know and now it's like you're going to", "28:46", "Mexico heard about the gangs what about", "28:48", "the violence what about the cartel", "28:49", "people would go to Tijuana all the time", "28:52", "and you would worry because it was seedy", "28:54", "and crazy and you know a lot of ups", "28:56", "pickpockets and thieves", "28:58", "but it was never cartel violence cartel", "29:01", "violence is literally within the last 15", "29:04", "years or so and our strategy had the", "29:07", "opposite of the effect they wanted so", "29:09", "you get rid of El Chapo and you think", "29:11", "okay it's the decapitation strategy we", "29:12", "got rid of the top guy now we're good", "29:14", "but what happened is you had his cartel", "29:17", "became fractionalized and then you had", "29:19", "people fighting who were top officials", "29:21", "in his cartel and they both wanted to", "29:23", "become the head guy and so then there's", "29:25", "a war between those guys and their gangs", "29:27", "in the street so it's the exact opposite", "29:29", "of what they say they want which is", "29:31", "let's decrease the violence and make", "29:32", "make sure everything's running", "29:33", "peacefully and also an amazing fact that", "29:35", "I just learned about a few weeks ago", "29:36", "there are 200,000 deaths that have", "29:39", "happened as a result of the drug war", "29:41", "200,000 that's crazier in America know", "29:45", "the u.s. and Mexico that seems low do", "29:48", "you think that's low I thought that was", "29:50", "so high I mean I guess because it's been", "29:51", "going on since Reagan you know one would", "29:53", "think okay it's way more Nixon I'm sorry", "29:55", "Nixon not Reagan right but that was like", "29:57", "inside the United States but I mean like", "30:00", "how do you classify a like what was done", "30:05", "because of the drug war you'd have to go", "30:07", "with all the stuff that happened in", "30:08", "Vietnam with heroin I mean how many", "30:11", "people were killed should say include", "30:12", "via I think this is just for the US and", "30:14", "Mexico and I think it's tied to what we", "30:16", "were talking about the cartel violence", "30:18", "and then people get caught in the", "30:19", "crossfire and they get their lives", "30:20", "destroyed it still seems low to me", "30:22", "yeah and it's a over a trillion dollars", "30:24", "has been wasted on this I'd be", "30:27", "interested in talking to some", "30:28", "who is an expert okay get Chris Christie", "30:31", "on but it was a real expert on Mexico", "30:35", "and what happened with the cartels the", "30:37", "rise the cartels because I'm sure there", "30:39", "was always organized violence and", "30:41", "organized crime but like what happened", "30:44", "where it exploded to the point where I", "30:45", "mean I was just talking to a friend of", "30:48", "mine who said he won't go to Mexico I'm", "30:50", "like I've been to Mexico man Mexico was", "30:51", "great I was talking about Punta Mita you", "30:54",

was with my family and they have these", "31:06", "golf carts that you can drive around the", "31:07", "resort on and we said let's go to the", "31:10", "town let's go see what that there's a", "31:12", "town right outside of the resort let's", "31:15", "go see what it's like you go out of the", "31:17", "resort in a block", "31:20", "you hit a military station where there's", "31:22", "men that are standing by on armored", "31:25", "vehicles so I said to my wife I said do", "31:28", "you know why they're there and they're", "31:29", "there to guard the resort I know that's", "31:31", "what this is she's like you really think", "31:33", "so I know I know so why are they", "31:35", "standing here on top of this they have a", "31:38", "pull these like steel plates with", "31:40", "machine guns", "31:40", "these guys have flak jackets on and", "31:42", "they're standing there on top of these", "31:44", "military vehicles standing there like", "31:47", "they're ready they're on standby this", "31:49", "fucking thing is right outside the gates", "31:51", "of the Four Seasons yeah this is what", "31:54", "this is scary yeah they're there to make", "31:56", "sure that they protect their tourism", "31:58", "industry yeah and that's all directly", "32:01", "tied to the drug war well the drug war", "32:02", "has had a massive impact on our cocoa", "32:05", "acapulco used to play be the place where", "32:07", "everybody would go they said the Vegas", "32:09", "of Mexico if they were trying to rival", "32:10", "Vegas and now that's where they say", "32:12", "there's mega cartel violence they don't", "32:14", "even just call them cartels now I would", "32:15", "say there are mega cartels they're", "32:17", "fighting for more power well then not", "32:18", "only that there's been some violence", "32:20", "where they purposely killed people that", "32:23", "were staying in resorts to sort of send", "32:25", "a message like oh my goodness yeah and", "32:28", "there's dead politicians too where they", "32:29", "they found these mass graves did you", "32:31", "hear about that every now and then", "32:33", "they'll stumble across a 200-person mass", "32:35", "grave and then whoever's not being", "32:37", "killed", "32:38", "they're usually being bribed by the", "32:39", "cartels so some experts have said this", "32:41", "is", "32:42", "a narco-state at this point I'm curious", "32:44", "what this new guy's gonna do because", "32:46", "this new guys supposed to be Anti", "32:48", "Corruption and hopefully I don't know", "32:50", "what his position is on the drug war but", "32:52", "I'd be surprised if his position was not", "32:53", "hey let's find another way to do this", "32:55", "because now world opinion has shifted I", "32:57", "mean in the u.s. 62 percent of the", "32:58", "country says less legalized marijuana", "33:00", "yeah and that's and honestly I think", "33:02", "people are thinking that without even", "33:04", "realizing that there's a giant spike in", "33:06", "crime because it's illegal yeah they", "33:09", "don't even know yeah I agree", "33:10", "and they're also killing journalists in", "33:12", "Mexico yeah they're

like", "74:31", "you think it should be between a man and", "74:32", "a woman like what does that even mean it", "74:34", "means you're trying to pander to what", "74:36", "you think is the majority sentiment in", "74:38", "the religious country yes you're going", "74:40", "exact meanwhile Bernie Sanders is the", "74:42", "fundamentally the opposite of Hillary", "74:44", "Clinton and agree or disagree with him", "74:45", "for the past 30 40 years he's had the", "74:48", "same ideology saying the same stuff yes", "74:50", "very very progressive and maybe he's", "74:53", "totally wrong about some of his", "74:54", "socialist ideas maybe would bankrupt the", "74:57", "country maybe some of his I don't think", "74:59", "it would I don't know would either", "75:00", "should maybe would maybe it would be", "75:03", "catastrophic to our economy to happen", "75:06", "maybe would be bad maybe it would be the", "75:09", "opposite of what we're dealing with", "75:10", "right now with in in terms of the", "75:13", "progression of unemployment where", "75:15", "unemployment is at an all-time high and", "75:18", "that or all-time low rather where when", "75:22", "you're looking at people that are doing", "75:23", "well in this country because of some of", "75:25", "the things that Trump's implemented", "75:26", "whether it's people that are getting", "75:29", "lower wage jobs than they would like to", "75:32", "have or whatever it is when you look at", "75:33", "the numbers maybe those numbers would go", "75:35", "in the other way so but my point is what", "75:38", "he represents though is someone who's", "75:40", "not corrupt what he represents is", "75:42", "someone who's not beholden to banks but", "75:44", "he represents someone who doesn't care", "75:46", "about money it's not his thing it's", "75:47", "never been his thing yeah his thing's", "75:49", "been social justice and whether it's", "75:51", "right or wrong at least it would", "75:53", "represent something entirely different", "75:56", "whereas what Clinton represented was", "75:58", "corruption with a different taste to it", "76:01", "so what I would say I agree with a lot", "76:03", "of what you just said there in terms of", "76:05", "Bernie I personally wouldn't use the", "76:08", "term social justice for him because that", "76:09", "has you know social justice yeah it's a", "76:13", "thing on the internet and you know", "76:14", "everybody it's basically what I think of", "76:17", "when I hear social justice warrior is", "76:19", "oversensitive college kid with pink hair", "76:20", "who's trying to deep platform", "76:21", "conservative speakers now right but", "76:24", "that's unfortunate that it's become that", "76:26", "well I mean let's let's take the way", "76:28", "social justice let's let's say", "76:30", "progressive ideology okay say that but", "76:33", "what Bernie Sanders actually represents", "76:35", "in my mind and based on his record is", "76:37", "what he wants to do is make this country", "76:40", "like every other developed country on", "76:42", "the planet that's already kicking our", "76:44", "ass in so many relevant areas so there's", "76:47", "this common argument which is nothing", "76:49", "but a straw man argument that comes from", "76:51", "the far right where they say Bernie", "76:53", "Sanders in his ideology he wants to make", "76:55", "the United States like Venezuela or like", "76:57", "Cuba or sometimes even say like the old", "76:58", "Soviet Union well no if you actually go", "77:01", "issue for issue pretty clearly", "77:03", "he's asking for is a Swedish or", "77:05", "Norwegian type system which is similar", "77:08", "to the US except the major differences", "77:10", "they have universal health care some of", "77:13", "these places have universal education so", "77:15", "and you know middle-class wages are", "77:17", "higher so what he's asking for is a", "77:19", "better mixed economy it's called social", "77:21", "democracy he's asking for a social", "77:23", "democratic type system it is not post", "77:26", "capitalist it's not saying let's totally", "77:28", "scrap the system and let's all you know", "77:29", "act like we're whatever Hugo Chavez or", "77:32", "Che Guevara what he's what he's asking", "77:33", "for is actually I would call it moderate", "77:36", "in an international sense because he", "77:38", "looks at the rest of the developed world", "77:39", "and he goes man these guys are kicking", "77:41", "our ass on health care education their", "77:43", "ass and what what parts of the world so", "77:46", "when you look at healthcare for example", "77:47", "there's a study that came out from the", "77:49", "Commonwealth Fund which found that the", "77:50", "United States ranks 11th out of 11 when", "77:53", "it comes to develop countries in health", "77:54", "care so we have worse health outcomes", "77:57", "and it's more expensive and we don't", "77:59", "even cover everybody we have 29 million", "78:01", "people who are uninsured so when you go", "78:02", "there there's single-payer systems and", "78:04", "their systems beat us in every", "78:07", "measurable that be there we see worse", "78:08", "health outcomes based on what you have", "78:12", "someone who goes to the doctor worse", "78:14", "outcome in terms of like what happens", "78:16", "once you've been checked in algae the", "78:20", "study I don't know the answer that off", "78:21", "the top and that's that's a big issue is", "78:23", "because our we have a giant problem", "78:24", "obviously with our diet", "78:25", "you know and Mosher I'm not I wouldn't", "78:27", "deny that for a second how much of I", "78:28", "wonder how much of it is based on that", "78:30", "when you're dealing with worse health", "78:32", "outcomes like how much of that health", "78:34", "how many of those health problems are", "78:36", "there they're based on people's personal", "78:39", "choices rather than the health care", "78:41", "system that they're operating under so", "78:42", "that is definitely a serious problem and", "78:44", "one that needs conversation and needs", "78:46", "fixing what I'm referring to is stuff", "78:48", "that's more like we have 29 million", "78:50", "people who are uninsured in this country", "78:52", "we have anywhere from 32 to 45,000", "78:54", "people that die every year in this", "78:56", "country because they don't have access", "78:57", "to basic health care we pay per capita", "79:00", "we pay double what other developed", "79:02", "countries pay and again they cover", "79:03", "everybody we don't cover everybody so", "79:05", "it's very it's we're failing in every", "79:08", "measurable way even if you control for", "79:10", "factors like you're accurately pointing", "79:12", "out you know I wonder what's going on", "79:14", "too in terms of like but we have a very", "79:16", "high", "79:17", "of really fantastic doctors well see I", "79:20", "know people that's the more I'm gonna", "79:22", "address that Nasir please go okay so if", "79:25", "you're a Saudi prince you do want to", "79:27", "come to the United States for healthcare", "79:28", "yeah because if you're in the top point", "79:30", "o 1% you are gonna get the best care", "79:32", "here right it's just a brain surgeon or", "79:34", "just if the Pedic surgeon for the", "79:37", "average person right you're gonna want", "79:39", "to be in Canada or Sweden or Norway or", "79:41", "Australia or any of those places this is",

I've", "80:03", "seen his bill and he advocates for a", "80:06", "particular type of Medicare for All", "80:07", "system you don't need to ban", "80:10", "supplemental private insurance in fact I", "80:13", "would totally disagree with any bill", "80:15", "that says we're now banning private", "80:17", "insurance because you can do a", "80:19", "single-payer system where you say we're", "80:21", "gonna have public funding of public", "80:23", "institutions or you could do a", "80:25", "single-payer system like the French do", "80:27", "or the Canadian do where they the", "80:29", "Canadians do where you have public", "80:31", "funding of private entities so what", "80:34", "you're talking about is you know hey how", "80:36", "are we gonna if there's no competition", "80:37", "how are we gonna get the best doctors", "80:39", "and things of that nature and my", "80:41", "reaction to that is I'm just talking", "80:43", "about the baseline public funding of", "80:45", "private institutions and still allow", "80:47", "people if they want to pay extra and go", "80:48", "to a specialist they could do that I'm", "80:50", "not necessarily even saying that what", "80:52", "I'm saying is that the system of having", "80:56", "an incentive for being excellent sure", "80:59", "having a financial incentive mm-hmm that", "81:01", "causes people to excel yes and I would", "81:04", "agree with that in certain fields not", "81:06", "another field well I think it's", "81:07", "certainly exists in the medical field in", "81:10", "surgery in many different medical", "81:13", "practices you find fantastic", "81:15", "practitioners here in the United States", "81:17", "because they get paid substantially for", "81:19", "it I would argue that the profit motive", "81:21", "specifically in the realm of healthcare", "81:24", "has had the opposite effect and has made", "81:26", "it so that we have a disastrous system", "81:28", "now if we talk about I agree with you as", "81:30", "well", "81:30", "with that as well but I think that when", "81:34", "you're saying that they kick our ass in", "81:35", "all these other areas like if you say I", "81:37", "have Canadian friends that come over", "81:39", "here to get operated on and I have in", "81:41", "the American friends who go to Canada to", "81:42", "get health care but it's cheaper that's", "81:44", "why
