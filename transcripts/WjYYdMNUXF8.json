the part of your brain that", "43:20", "produces swear words is not the part of", "43:23", "the brain that manages ordinary language", "43:26", "really interesting you know we have two", "43:30",

noises what if they just go", "44:28", "ah no it was swearing specifically hmm", "44:32", "so they've tried noises and swearing", "44:33", "yeah so it may be you know when you if", "44:35", "you're hammering a nail and hit your", "44:36", "thumb yeah you should use one of those", "44:39", "words that's a good strategy that's", "44:40", "interesting because I almost always do", "44:42", "that if I heard something especially a", "44:44", "finger like a slammed car door the other", "44:46", "day that's what that is but that's yeah", "44:50", "and that's interesting it's coming", "44:51",

the squares I'll leave you some", "45:02", "papers about the science of swearing", "45:03", "it's interesting yeah it's very", "45:04", "interesting", "45:05", "now what if what would happen if they",

"a you know a kind of game we all yeah", "45:58", "yes so but you're saying this game is", "46:02", "facilitated by one specific part of the", "46:04", "brain and so that because like I don't", "46:08", "swear words are taboo words here I have", "46:10", "blue words an often associated with", "46:12", "things that we find offensive mm-hmm or", "46:15", "with bodily acts that freak people

for some", "46:27", "words for some people like I remember", "46:28", "when I was a kid I lived", "46:30", "Florida for a little bit and I said hell", "46:33", "once and in Florida in the 1970s hell",

a", "47:33", "really yeah really big deal so like what", "47:37", "it would be different parts of the brain", "47:39", "would be activated mm-hmm by that versus", "47:42", "if you said it it would be not that big", "47:44", "a deal but if someone was like super", "47:46", "conservative and a saw even yeah more", "47:48", "yeah Wow yeah interesting what do you", "47:50", "think that that is a universal thing I", "47:52", "mean it seems to be univer seems to", "47:54", "universal another finding that came", "47:56", "across is that people who learn a second", "47:58", "language that swearing in the second", "48:01", "language does not have the same", "48:02", "emotional impact that your first", "48:04", "language does oh that makes sense that's", "48:06", "why they're so fun when

huh Wow huh so", "48:40", "that that would at least in my", "48:43", "brain seemed to indicate that there's", "48:46", "like some use for that yes well that", "48:49", "probably many uses one is this thing of", "48:51", "modulating pain what is a social bonding", "48:54", "you know forming some community yeah", "48:56", "that's how I kind of use it yeah I think", "48:58", "when I swear in front of

University", "56:13", "so coordinating all this stuff was", "56:15", "unbelievable and then once that all the", "56:17", "approvals came in I had to get the pot", "56:19", "and there was no legal source of it so I", "56:22", "Federal Bureau of Narcotics gave me", "56:24", "confiscated pot that they had", "56:26", "confiscated some case in Texas they", "56:29", "brought it over", "56:29", "they

"56:50", "run in the experiment so I said I looked", "56:51", "at it under the microscope and there was", "56:53", "no resin on it so they grumbled and they", "56:55", "gave me other stuff which was passable", "56:57", "so but again confiscated stuff yeah", "57:00", "because we always used to hear when we", "57:02", "were kids about government we'd the", "57:04", "government we'd was the good weed I was", "57:07", "later that was later when that well when", "57:09", "research got going and the US the", "57:12", "government started a pot farm in", "57:14", "Mississippi my pot for research which", "57:16", "was much better and there was only a", "57:18", "handful of people that were under these", "57:19", "experiments correct so they made it so", "57:23", "difficult", "57:23", "mmm conduct research as they have with", "57:26", "psychedelics no that's slowly changing", "57:27", "now yeah well you know Rick Strassman", "57:30", "sure yeah when he was doing that book", "57:33",

this with government", "57:49", "approval yeah which I thought was really", "57:51", "fascinating fascinating yeah and the", "57:52", "fact that they did it and with the", "57:55", "informations out and then there's been", "57:57", "like very little movement in that", "57:59", "direction it's kind of just like okay", "58:01", "now we know but look everybody's fine", "58:04", "it's a lot of benefit do we do want to", "58:06", "act on this like you know it takes", "58:08", "decades reverent and flus what research", "58:12", "was done all along it was from her to", "58:14", "look for negative effects", "58:16", "ah you know nobody who wanted to look", "58:18", "for positive effects got permission and", "58:20", "funding that's interesting so you have", "58:22", "to kind of frame

metal", "79:34", "on your still report back yeah and I'm", "79:36", "gonna go look at that burn I'll report", "79:39", "back to you yeah I mean I'm not saying", "79:41", "that anecdotal evidence is always", "79:42", "inaccurate it's most certainly accurate", "79:44", "many times sometimes sometimes yeah yeah", "79:47", "I mean it's just as likelihood it's not", "79:49", "that it is but nanoq

you're", "80:07", "tripping your balls off and yeah and", "80:09", "something happened in my body that would", "80:11", "be interesting if that was I'm sorry", "80:13", "change yeah in your body's

if you and influenced", "81:34", "it through hypnosis or through guided", "81:36", "imagery just see if you can change it in", "81:37", "any way I don't know hypnosis and guided", "81:39", "imagery yeah there are two mind-body", "81:41", "techniques I think any it's worth trying", "81:43", "I did read once that there was this I", "81:47", "think it was a young man who had some", "81:50", "awful one of those awful wart diseases", "81:54", "and there was one called ichthyosis", "81:57", "which is like the holy lover yes", "81:59", "calloused hard tissue yes and it went", "82:02", "away", "82:02", "hypnosis yeah yeah yeah over time I", "82:05", "wrote that case too they told him", "82:07", "they're like his arm that one arm was", "82:10", "going to buy cured and it just like", "82:12",

"82:31", "cut a particular plant under the full", "82:34", "moon and rub it and bury it blah blah", "82:36", "and but the wart falls off the next", "82:38", "morning and when you compare that to the",

vegan diet very similar effects", "88:18", "obviously very different diet exactly", "88:20", "yeah so it's the mind the mind the mind", "88:23", "is where it's at no how do we and the", "88:27", "big problem in science and medicine is", "88:29", "if we don't believe in the mind no", "88:30", "that's what I was saying earlier when", "88:32", "you were talking about mine it's not", "88:33",

"88:53", "the physical system the dogma is the", "88:56", "cause has to be physical when you talk", "88:58", "about a non-physical cause of a physical", "89:00", "event scientists too now well that's", "89:03", "really unfortunate because we know so", "89:05", "much about how attitude does shape yeah", "89:07", "the way your body reacts to things going", "89:09", "back to the Sarno stuff you know that", "89:11", "we're back pain it's all that stuff it's", "89:14", "like you know that that to me that you", "89:16", "can't separate the mind and body there", "89:18", "are two poles of the same thing well if", "89:21", "the placebo effect is real it is", "89:23", "documented yeah it's documented so", "89:25", "obviously something is going on with the", "89:27", "way you feel about things and think", "89:28", "about things that's having an actual", "89:30", "physiological effect there's something", "89:32", "happening to your body because the way", "89:34", "you're thinking about it right happening", "89:35", "to your body now one of the things that", "89:36", "has made this you know suddenly of", "89:38", "interest in the medical world is that we", "89:42", "now have these techniques like", "89:43", "functional MRIs yeah PET scans where we", "89:46", "can observe living brains and you can", "89:48", "show that the placebo response is", "89:50", "associated with particular activity in", "89:53", "certain brain centers that has made it", "89:54", "real for people that otherwise didn't", "89:57", "believe in it", "89:57", "mm yes right like there's a medically", "90:00", "documented there's something that you", "90:02", "actually get a hook into yeah you can", "90:05", "you could put it on a scale yes exactly", "90:07", "yeah what what part of the brain is", "90:09", "responsible for the placebo effect well", "90:11", "again it's probably the some of these", "90:13", "deep brain centers that same ones", "90:15", "involved in sweat and swearing you know", "90:17", "that the same thing it's coming from", "90:19", "centers that connect to emotional Reed", "90:21", "you know to emotion yeah", "90:24", "the ability to turn that on off", "90:26", "consciously and willingly is tricky yeah", "90:29", "you know another thing I looked at over", "90:31", "the years was Healing shrines in the", "90:35", "world like Lord mm-hmm the there's two", "90:38", "interesting facts about that you know", "90:39", "the over the years the Catholic Church", "90:41", "has accepted very few healings as", "90:44", "genuine that are have like full medical", "90:46", "documentation and some of them are quite", "90:47", "spectacular like miraculous", "90:49", "disappearance of widely disseminated", "90:51", "cancer no native of Lourdes has ever", "90:54",

"91:04", "saw visions of the Virgin Mary and", "91:07", "anyway it's grown up into a there's a", "91:10", "grotto and you know it's now a major", "91:12", "Catholic shrine and it has a reputation", "91:14", "for healing and thousands and thousands", "91:16", "of people over the years have gone there", "91:18", "so as I said very you know there's", "91:21", "relatively few reported healings that", "91:23", "have been documented medically but no", "91:25", "native of Luard has ever been healed and", "91:27", "the there's something called the Lord", "91:30", "phenomenon which is fascinating that the", "91:32", "chances that a person is going to be", "91:34", "healed at Lourdes or a place like that", "91:35", "is directly proportional to the length", "91:38", "of the journey travel - yeah I have", "91:41", "heard that so the length of the journey", "91:42", "is an investment of belief right so", "91:45", "you're projecting belief onto the plate", "91:47", "place and then you get it back yeah that", "91:50", "that seems like that could essentially", "91:51", "work with any very very difficult", "91:54", "absolution quest type absolute", "91:56", "experience that you're going on you're", "91:57", "looking for something and you'd have to", "91:59", "earn it", "91:59", "yeah after your to be fully invested", "92:02", "there'll be something going on in the", "92:03", "mind that has you convinced this is a", "92:05", "real effect but the power is not in the", "92:08", "place the powers and you know", "92:09", "here hmm and you're projecting it onto", "92:12", "that but man wouldn't be better if you", "92:14", "didn't have to go all the way yeah it's", "92:15", "great how do you get that going like if", "92:22", "someone said to you okay man I don't", "92:23", "want to go to Lourdes but what should I", "92:25", "do", "92:25", "well one is that you could imagine", "92:28", "you're going to Lourdes and that's", "92:29", "taking advantage of this function of", "92:30", "visualization that's why these therapies", "92:32", "like guided imagery seem to work you can", "92:34", "imagine something and have it become", "92:36", "real guided imagery now is there a", "92:39", "specific you know if there's like", "92:40", "transcendental medication there's Buddha", "92:42", "you know this is a formal it's a formal", "92:44", "system of therapy that people are", "92:46", "trained in where you you know you sit", "92:48", "with a practitioner and they help you", "92:50", "explore your mental imagery and may give", "92:53", "you specific kinds of images to work", "92:55", "with pending on the condition that", "92:57", "you're dealing with", "92:59", "I would think knowing the fact that we", "93:03", "we have real evidence that placebo", "93:05", "effect works why isn't there more study", "93:07", "done to try or more thought and more", "93:11", "more people that are trying to emphasize", "93:14", "this ability of the terian it's we're up", "93:16", "against this problem that in the", "93:18", "dominant paradigm in science in medicine", "93:21", "we don't believe in non-physical", "93:23", "causation of physical events but that", "93:25", "doesn't jive with me because we do", "93:27", "believe in the placebo effects like", "93:28", "everybody says that oh it's just a", "93:30", "placebo right you said that earlier", "93:31", "right people always say that but it", "93:33", "still works right but but we're not", "93:36", "using it right we should be using it", "93:39", "should be use them it's the meat of", "93:40", "medicine we want to make it happen more", "93:43", "at the time it's just that we're so", "93:46", "flawed in our approach it's really", "93:48", "interesting that's like the the human", "93:50", "body and the human mind is such an", "93:53", "incredibly complicated biological entity", "93:56", "right our ability to consciously be", "93:58", "aware of our our life our position in", "94:03", "the world our

right exactly we have", "94:14", "this incredible machine that can invent", "94:16", "nuclear bombs and satellites and there's", "94:19", "no users manual no users manual for the", "94:22", "mind or the", "94:22", "especially not in how to manage the body", "94:25", "with the mind", "94:26", "nothing now they figured out this wide", "94:28", "open if you're on your own", "94:29", "yeah few people have got you got to like", "94:30", "find these masters right so if you think", "94:33", "about the 300 and whatever million", "94:36", "people we have in this country how many", "94:37", "of those people could guide you towards", "94:39", "a proper integration of mind and body", "94:43", "and a positive way of interfacing with", "94:46", "reality that's beneficial to you", "94:49", "physically

people that fail on diets boy", "95:06", "they'd like to get skinny even people", "95:08", "that you know fail at school why I wish", "95:09", "I was smart enough to graduate I wish I", "95:11", "had enough discipline people people want", "95:13", "to do better huh so there's this vast", "95:15", "need for coaching that would lead to", "95:18", "improvement yet almost I mean nothing to", "95:22", "speak of and certainly not nothing", "95:24", "large-scale in any city that has this", "95:27", "approach where look we are gonna teach", "95:29", "you how to better engage with the the", "95:34",

"patient if I can introduce that patient", "96:02", "to someone who's had their condition is", "96:04", "now better that is a very powerful way", "96:06", "to up their belief in the possibility", "96:09", "getting better yeah that makes sense", "96:11", "which is why people love user", "96:13", "testimonials right but you but better if", "96:16", "you actually meet the person and show", "96:18", "hope see for yourself", "96:19", "yeah but user testimonials are so huge", "96:21", "for that reason you know I was skeptical", "96:23", "at first but then I tried it boy I call", "96:26", "he was kept it'll just like me yeah it's", "96:29", "to me when I look at the giant number of", "96:34", "people that are unhappy", "96:36", "and displaced and just seem like they're", "96:38", "left out of society I was listening to", "96:42", "oh it was Johann Hari on Sam Harris's", "96:45", "podcast they were talking about the", "96:48", "number of people that are happy with", "96:52", "what they do for a living", "96:53", "mmm-hmm happy with what they do every", "96:55", "day and it was somewhere around 13% long", "96:58", "yeah and then the number of people that", "97:01", "were just like it's okay I just do it", "97:03", "like I don't hate it but I don't love it", "97:06", "that was like in the 60% and then the", "97:08", "rest of the people fucking hated what", "97:10", "they did so the vast majority some", "97:14", "ungodly number you know like 87% of", "97:18", "people hate what they're doing oh how", "97:21", "sad all right if don't hate it they", "97:23", "don't want to be doing it and they do it", "97:25", "all the time yeah that's crazy you know", "97:27", "that that has to have a profound effect", "97:30", "on all aspects of your life right I like", "97:33",

"97:50", "yeah and much more so now than ever", "97:53", "before much more so than ever before", "97:54", "yeah when you were doing those studies", "97:55", "in the 1960s and you thought that", "97:57", "marijuana is gonna be legal in five", "97:58", "years how could you have ever first of", "98:01", "all how could you have ever thought of", "98:02", "the Internet right that's the big right", "98:04", "the distribution of information sure", "98:06", "yeah that's that's really the big one", "98:09", "the decentralized distribution of", "98:11", "information and that's that by the way", "98:13", "in medicine has real it's one of the", "98:14", "things that's most leveled the playing", "98:16", "field between doctors and patients mhm", "98:18", "you know it sort of ended the", "98:19", "authoritarian paternalistic kind of", "98:22", "medicine that was when I grew up well", "98:25", "it's it is a problem right a patient", "98:28", "comes they think they know everything",

didn't", "98:37", "know about it I mean I think on the", "98:39", "whole it's a really good thing oh yeah", "98:41", "for sure no no for sure I'm saying just", "98:43", "like I get how doctors be worn out by it", "98:45", "all right you know listen to me I went", "98:47", "to school this is what it is well it's", "98:49", "good for", "98:49", "to have to let go of that yeah well I", "98:52",

we", "99:08", "got too many specialists and there's", "99:09", "yeah so someone like would you think of", "99:11", "a generalist as someone who sort of", "99:13", "guides you towards various specialists", "99:15", "I'm a general practitioner I'm very", "99:16", "proud of it", "99:17", "there's a good data showing that states", "99:19", "that have a higher number of prime of", "99:22",
