["00:00", "hello freak bitches well what's", "00:03", "interesting too is that there's all", "00:04", "these different approaches to strength", "00:06", "and conditioning and that's one of the", "00:08", "reasons why I wanted to talk to you", "00:09", "because one of the things that I had", "00:10", "seen was Matt working out with you and", "00:13", "your guys and he was doing all kinds of", "00:14", "crazy stuff like when you devise a plan", "00:17", "like for an athlete like a matte brown", "00:20", "or someone like that like what do you do", "00:22", "you work with them first to try to", "00:23", "figure out what they're capable of and", "00:25", "then think about like what their style", "00:27", "is like obviously you gonna have a", "00:28", "different different need if you're a", "00:31", "striker versus a grappler well one thing", "00:34", "we do we try to get more air conditioned", "00:36", "to do five minute rounds and recover in", "00:37", "one minute when I worked everything was", "00:39", "five minutes and then it recovery some", "00:41", "guys I'd run through eight eight rounds", "00:43", "a lot of guys who was able to do that I", "00:45", "mean pretty good fighters you know 13 13", "00:48", "wins and you know pro fights stuff like", "00:51", "that so just were there recovery uh I", "00:53", "want to maximize the amount of work you", "00:55", "can do in five minutes and then be able", "00:57", "to cover in one minute and do it again", "00:58", "repeatedly that's all I ever did working", "01:01", "5-minute intervals so did you work with", "01:03", "guys who use heart rate monitors and", "01:05", "like how did you decide what to have", "01:06", "them done any of that really never know", "01:08", "my friend of John Saylor he's got", "01:10", "Shinnecock jujitsu he's basically", "01:12", "started almost really the first MMA", "01:15", "school in America if you think about", "01:16", "because he was judo jujitsu samba but", "01:19", "also striking and he started in 1985 oh", "01:22", "wow and he does everything by heart rate", "01:24", "where we do think my percentages like I", "01:26", "said we trade by a rates of velocity", "01:28", "speech strength to be attracted 75 to", "01:30", "85% he would do heart rates like that", "01:33", "and like if you and I would grapple if", "01:35", "we could talk to each other for a half", "01:37", "hour to be optimal", "01:38", "you know me and you could talk while", "01:39", "we're doing it doesn't hop that my heart", "01:41", "rate there that way so he kept track of", "01:42", "heart rates cut basically how we do a", "01:45", "percentage of one rep max so meaning", "01:47", "that it's optimal if you could still", "01:49", "talk while you're doing the exercise", "01:51", "rate optimally you know you're not right", "01:54", "like you know that's how I would be you", "01:55", "know so but if you're gonna fight like", "01:58", "if you're in a fight and it's a very", "02:00", "high paced fight it's very likely that", "02:02", "you're gonna achieve much higher rates", "02:03", "of heart rate might be much more", "02:05", "exhausted that's right but see that", "02:07", "would be up too much how we train our", "02:08", "speed days I kept too", "02:10", "today for squatting and everything is", "02:12", "out the mud they do 25 squats at one way", "02:15", "and to end for speed strength", "02:17", "acceleration in two and 20 deadlifts and", "02:19", "then the other days max effort and", "02:21", "that's what you're talking about what", "02:22", "you go all out and around so much", "02:24", "pushing it you know they're trying to", "02:25", "take you out so you got to fight back so", "02:27", "uh it would see it always changes you", "02:29", "can't do the same thing it's called law", "02:30", "of accommodation few night if you and I", "02:33", "grappled at the same rate all the time I", "02:35", "would actually catch up to you you know", "02:38", "so you'd have to be able to you know", "02:40", "maximize your potential and run me in", "02:41", "the dirt so that's why you gotta have", "02:44", "two different days you know you can't", "02:45", "just do the same type of work all the", "02:47", "time I think that's where a lot of puns", "02:48", "go wrong they get where they pace", "02:50", "yourself too much you see that before", "02:51", "fighters you're the old fighters cover", "02:53", "up and I you know I watch fights all my", "02:57", "life from Roberto Duran that Muhammad", "02:59", "Allah I watched a month I'm sure you've", "03:02", "got to be a big fight fan and you just", "03:03", "see how some people get in a scheduled", "03:05", "amount of work per round and that's when", "03:07", "you can beat them take them out yeah in", "03:09", "other words you know I'm gonna make you", "03:10", "go up my pace not you go might be yeah", "03:13", "I'm gonna follow your pace you'll make", "03:14", "you build mine so varying the intensity", "03:17", "of the training varying how you do your", "03:19", "training you think that's very important", "03:20", "very important has to change all the", "03:21", "time", "03:22", "so does it have to change all the time", "03:24", "because the body just adapts and gets a", "03:26", "fish in try that's what the law of", "03:29", "accommodation is you adapt to a training", "03:31", "load or stimulus and if you don't change", "03:33", "this you get no better you actually go", "03:35", "backwards so you can actually got to", "03:37", "change these stimulus time does a lot of", "03:39", "stuff with war barrels we push war bells", "03:40", "around for half a mile running sometimes", "03:43", "heavier weight walking get in a belt", "03:46", "squat all is very grueling and then just", "03:48", "a maximal strength which the simple", "03:50", "things like get those good mornings we", "03:52", "do a lot of stuff holding the bars in", "03:53", "their elbows tom has to do a lot of that", "03:55", "because almost like you know grappling", "03:56", "mm-hm fumbling and then other times you", "03:59", "know you got to do quick stuff so", "04:01", "quicker page stuff so you know it does", "04:03", "how fights are there never one pace now", "04:05", "how do you like create a schedule like", "04:07", "say if you're working with a guy and you", "04:09", "you know", "04:10", "we don't believe in schedule don't", "04:11", "believe in it now even my guys I had the", "04:13", "strongest gym in the world spoke about", "04:15", "140 all-time world records at breakfast", "04:17", "and Tom can verify at breakfast in the", "04:20", "morning at six o'clock 6:30 we decide", "04:22", "what we're going to do that day because", "04:23", "he strengths measured in time it's not", "04:26", "measured in weight it's mentioned in", "04:28", "time arrow talked about velocities and", "04:31", "so we just pick an exercise like for you", "04:33", "if we did a real no Bach squat then it", "04:36", "takes longer than squatting 800 pounds", "04:37", "you're gonna squat 800 pounds you you", "04:40", "know you choked me out you can't after a", "04:42", "while I'm going to tap alright or if we", "04:44", "run after a while I'm gonna run out", "04:46", "oxygen I'm going to quit say thank for", "04:48", "strengthing nice change so long so long", "04:50", "as you strain at least that length of", "04:52", "time or longer you're going to break it", "04:53", "a classical lift and swap internet with", "English (auto-generated)"]
