what I did and", "49:29", "Mickey will come in behind me and say", "49:31", "this is the medical science behind that", "49:33", "and this is how we treated it why but I", "49:36", "would have an injury to one singular", "49:38", "area of my brain but I would have four", "49:40", "different symptoms affecting four", "49:41", "different parts of my brain four", "49:43", "different senses and you know he would", "49:47", "have to hone in on the one that was", "49:49", "broken and then know to fix it and when", "49:52", "he started fixing it all the other ones", "49:53", "would start
