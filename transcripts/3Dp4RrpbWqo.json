of clubs yeah it's", "02:12", "like a pool player basically", "02:13", "who uses one cue and maybe one cue to", "02:16", "break with and some players even break", "02:18", "with their playing cue but you you don't", "02:20", "have like a bunch of different cues for", "02:22", "a bunch of different shots usually right", "02:24", "well there's because the distances but", "02:26", "just get used to the feel of one cue so", "02:28", "when a player changes cues like say if", "02:30", "you go from a 18 ounce cue to a 21 ounce", "02:33", "- there's a big difference in the way it", "02:34", "hits the ball it drives through the ball", "02:36", "different you have to make the cue do", "02:38", "more of the work and write heavy with a", "02:40", "heavy cute do you think it mentally", "02:41",

his clubs", "02:55", "are cut to the same length which is", "02:57", "really rare nobody does that like almost", "02:59", "every club set you get is all different", "03:01", "lengths clubs and he is this people did", "03:04", "it years and years ago but he's like one", "03:06", "of the only guys on tour that now cuts", "03:07", "his club's to the same length", "03:08", "because he mentally wants to have the", "03:10", "same exact stance over the ball no", "03:12", "matter of the shot Wow it's pretty smart", "03:13", "I mean it's a it's a cool interesting", "03:16", "concept a lot of golfers

ugliest shots in basketball", "03:34", "tend to be some of the most fun to watch", "03:37", "and sometimes they're really good yeah", "03:39", "like sometimes like the classic Ray", "03:41", "Allen basketball stroke is probably the", "03:43", "most beautiful jump shot you know", "03:44", "compared to him and Jordan but there are", "03:47", "guys that have terrible looking shots", "03:48", "but they're fucking phenomenal mm-hmm", "03:51", "it's just it's just consistency and", "03:52", "their inner balance over you know the", "03:55", "the timing that they have and the", "03:56", "release that they have that's just a", "03:57", "that's got to be the same thing in every", "03:59", "sport pool for some shit for shirin -", "04:02", "yeah you know in boxing it used to be", "04:04", "thought that you pretty much you know if", "04:07", "you went to a good trainer they would", "04:09", "teach you to keep your hands up that was", "04:11", "always the way to box but then you get", "04:13", "to a level of like a Tommy Hearns", "04:15", "remember the way Tommy Hearns used to", "04:17", "fight he's to keep his left hand low", "04:18", "really low yeah down to the hand cocked", "04:21", "and he would snap that left hand at you", "04:24", "like a fucking let goes cold bro", "04:27", "his crack Motorcity Cobra he would just", "04:29", "pop that fucker right in your face",

in", "04:45", "147 pounds I think he was probably like", "04:47", "6 - and just shred", "04:49", "jacked and just grunted 47 at six - is", "04:53", "to a champ you ever see what he looked", "04:55",

that", "05:48", "first and then we're gonna go back to", "05:50", "Marvin Hagler versus Tommy Hearns so you", "05:52", "get a feel for what it was like to be", "05:54", "able to switch stances is so crazy to me", "05:56", "to be able to do that so fluidly that", "05:58", "well that's one of the brilliant things", "06:00", "about Hagler I mean he was just so good", "06:02", "at that", "06:02", "and he get by it's weird for a guy when", "06:05", "you're used to I remember the first time", "06:06", "I fought a guy who was left-handed it", "06:07", "was super confusing everything's coming", "06:10", "from the wrong place", "06:11", "everything looks like reversed you got", "06:12", "to get used to it right you don't see it", "06:14", "as often right so if you don't see it as", "06:16", "often and sometimes it's more effective", "06:17", "but some guys were really good against", "06:19", "southpaws some guys have like a", "06:21", "Lightning right hand and that was one of", "06:23", "the speculations about Hagler and Hearns", "06:25", "cuz Hearns had this lightning right hand", "06:27", "and Hagler oftentimes fought southpaw", "06:30", "that's the counter for southpaw is a", "06:32", "straight right now watch this though", "06:34", "this is this goes to show you how God", "06:36", "look how big he is back", "06:38", "[Applause]", "06:39", "dude look at this oh come on

fast that looks", "06:56", "fast even in fucking slow-motion he was", "06:58", "so fast and he hit so hard but now you", "07:01", "gotta watch this and this is Hagler in", "07:03", "his prime he was 30 years old he was the", "07:05", "undisputed motherfucking middleweight", "07:08", "champ in the world and most people", "07:09", "thought he's the best pound-for-pound", "07:10", "fighter on earth and Tommy Hearns of", "07:13", "course you just saw what he did to", "07:14", "Roberto Duran yeah and it was a lot of", "07:16", "speculation a lot of speculation coming", "07:19", "into this fight and they just went at it", "07:21", "from the beginning of the round there", "07:23", "was very little feel ups just constant", "07:24", "pressure by Hagler right hooks boom but", "07:28", "let me look at this bro they they're", "07:29", "going to war these are two of the best", "07:32", "fucking middleweights ever and they're", "07:34", "standing in front of each other going to", "07:36", "war and it doesn't feel like anybody's", "07:39", "face it feels like there's I feels like", "07:40", "they're at the exact same energy level -", "07:42", "oh dude like both of them have the same", "07:43", "output look at throwing full power shots", "07:50", "from the moment the fight started and", "07:53", "they right in front of each other man it", "07:55", "for Hearns this this negates his", "07:57", "gigantic reach advantage over almost", "07:59", "everybody yeah so Hearns decided to", "08:02", "fight this way he decided to stand right", "08:04", "now look at him the referee could barely", "08:06", "separate him hers decide to stand right", "08:08", "in front of Hagler and Hagler decide to", "08:09", "stand right in front of Hearns and they", "08:11", "just now her and his movement see now", "08:13", "this is what Hearns could have done from", "08:14", "the beginning and made it interesting", "08:16", "sticking and moving but by the time he", "08:19", "decided to do that he was already", "08:20", "touched up and Marvin starts moving in", "08:22", "for the kill that left hand of the body", "08:24", "Hagler was relentless and his cardio was", "08:28", "fuckin supreme it was supreme he always", "08:31", "put pressure on people and you couldn't", "08:33", "hurt him he only had one bullshit", "08:35", "knocked down his entire career as a", "08:37", "bullshit knockdown he fought I think was", "08:39", "Juan Roldan and Juan Roldan kind of like", "08:41", "it was more like a shove and maybe maybe", "08:44", "they tripped or something like that and", "08:46", "the referee called it a knockdown but I", "08:48", "remember thinking god damn it", "08:51", "cuz Hagler had a weird thing that he was", "08:53", "either born with or developed he had", "08:55", "giant muscles on the side of his head", "08:58", "like he was a temple horn with headgear", "09:01", "I'm not bullshitting", "09:03", "they had him anta with a helmet on this", "09:05", "is like a big thing in the world of", "09:07", "sports back in the day like that he was", "09:08", "literally almost born for this that's", "09:11", "how good Hagler was yeah these", "09:13", "motherfuckers are I mean it's relentless", "09:14", "dude they're toed up every time it up", "09:16", "they're barely looking for any distance", "09:18", "between each other and you got to", "09:19", "realize man this is not how people", "09:21", "usually fight they don't throw full", "09:22", "power shots on every shot I mean they'd", "09:24", "be tired within 15 seconds these guys", "09:26", "are just going at it so I think this was", "09:28", "like almost like a game of chicken like", "09:30", "both of them knew they were never gonna", "09:31", "reach the 12th round right so they said", "09:33", "fuck it let's just do this and Hagler", "09:36", "just stood right in front of him", "09:37", "constantly blasting them and you see at", "09:39", "the end of the first round Hearns is", "09:41", "wilting he just does not have the power", "09:44", "or the speed or the movement see he's", "09:46", "all goofy yeah he's sloppy yeah just", "09:48", "exhausted he's exhausted but still the", "09:50", "warrior
