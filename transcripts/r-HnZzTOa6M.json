there's no such thing as a", "08:44", "perfectly fair competition that would be", "08:45", "designed by God to be per", "08:46", "effect and be perfectly fair right we're", "08:48", "always making choices about what kind of", "08:50", "competition we want to have and who we", "08:53", "want to allow into it and what sort of", "08:55", "outcome we want to have you know what I", "08:57", "mean right just like in baseball too", "08:59", "many home runs move the mound up or down", "09:01", "you know how they change the rules a", "09:02", "little bit can they want more home runs", "09:03", "same thing with same thing with track", "09:05", "and field we change the rules a little", "09:06", "bit to allow this person to not allow", "09:08", "this person right I think that when", "09:10", "we're talking about people we should", "09:11", "always try to include more people not", "09:13", "less we should you know like if and if", "09:14", "hey if you're a double amputee and you", "09:16", "can get your way into the Olympics oh", "09:17", "you can make a plausible case I think we", "09:19", "should try to entertain that notion and", "09:20", "we should try to find a way to get that", "09:21", "guy in there right as far as trans", "09:24", "athletes go you know we could have we", "09:26", "could sit here and talk for three hours", "09:27", "about like all the different ways that", "09:29", "hormones might affect your body might", "09:30", "not affect your body and I'm not an", "09:31", "expert on that and I don't want to claim", "09:33", "to be right but a sports with trans", "09:38", "athletes who are you know competing with", "09:41", "the you know with their gender right", "09:43", "that's that is a sporting world that I'm", "09:46", "more interested in right and I think we", "09:48", "should find a way to make that happen I", "09:49", "know it's gonna be really complicated", "09:50", "complicated and messy right and there's", "09:53", "gonna be a lot debate about it and it's", "09:55", "gonna make it's gonna be uncomfortable", "09:55", "you know there's gonna be a lot of", "09:57", "arguments but you know I hope that", "09:59", "that's the world that we have moved", "10:00", "forward to that's my that's my point of", "10:01", "view my point of view is that there's a", "10:05", "reason there's a distinction there's a", "10:08", "reason why we make the distinction to", "10:09", "have male athletics versus female", "10:12", "athletic s-- the reason is that males", "10:14", "have a physiological physiological", "10:16", "advantage over women so in most sports", "10:18", "most physical sports we do not have", "10:20", "males compete with females the question", "10:23", "becomes when someone who is male", "10:25", "transitions and becomes female do those", "10:29", "same physiological advantages apply and", "10:32", "what what are they what is the evidence", "10:34", "well the evidence and competition seems", "10:35", "to be that it shows that it does apply", "10:37", "particularly in weightlifting rugby", "10:40", "mountain biking power heavy sports that", "10:43", "are that favored larger people stronger", "10:47", "bodies males that transition to females", "10:50", "have a significant advantage in their", "10:52", "breaking World Records so if you're a", "10:54", "woman and you're a natural woman and you", "10:57", "don't take any extra hormones or male", "10:59", "hormones you", "10:59", "taking steroids or any sort of", "11:01", "performance-enhancing drugs you're doing", "11:03", "your very best to compete and you're at", "11:05", "the top of the heap but then someone", "11:07", "comes along that was a man for 30 years", "11:10", "and decides they're going to be a woman", "11:11", "and this has happened and literally", "11:13", "transitioned a few months ago and", "11:14", "competes as a woman and destroys records", "11:17", "and dominates you in that sport that's", "11:20", "bullshit and that's not competing on a", "11:23", "level playing field that's a person", "11:25", "who's biologically a male and who is a", "11:28", "male for 30 plus years of having", "11:29", "testosterone run through their body and", "11:31", "affect their tendon strength and affect", "11:33", "the shape of their bones and the", "11:35", "mechanical advantages of the male hips", "11:37", "versus the female hips and then they're", "11:39", "competing with smaller people who have", "11:43", "been a woman their whole life it's not", "11:44", "fair it's it's as much cheating as", "11:47", "taking steroids when the other person", "11:49", "doesn't or taking performance-enhancing", "11:51", "drugs when the other person doesn't", "11:52", "maybe even more so maybe even more so", "11:55", "because you also have there's a bunch of", "11:58", "advantages in terms of reaction time", "12:00", "that males enjoy it's like it's some", "12:02", "significant difference in reaction time", "12:04", "between males and even untrained males", "12:06", "versus female professional athletes but", "12:09", "I see at the beginning of my guys call", "12:11", "it career like I used to not prepare at", "12:14", "all I was still drinking using a guy up", "12:16", "on stage I chopped shit up I'd get into", "12:18", "confrontation when I say chops you up", "12:19", "I'd take up animals shit part animal", "12:22", "parts
