"08:31", "charming", "08:31", "and very um uh quite bright and quite", "08:35", "like socially you know that was that was", "08:38", "all good but i think", "08:40", "like inside i was um i was very", "08:41", "intimidated by the kind of", "08:43", "sporty kids you would have terrified me", "08:46", "as a as a child um and", "08:50", "uh i athletic kids like yeah just sports", "08:53", "yeah yeah just that exactly cause i", "08:54", "really didn't fit in with any of that", "08:56", "um and so like when i first saw i might", "08:59", "like i started my career as a hypnotist", "09:01", "and i", "09:01", "i saw this guy performing at university", "09:04", "and i uh", "09:05", "i just thought i'm gonna i'm gonna do", "09:07", "that it just i didn't realize at the", "09:08", "time all these boxes that it was ticking", "09:10", "you know performing", "09:11", "that sort of you know need for", "09:13", "affirmation and", "09:14", "and love and center of attention and", "09:16", "also the control aspect of it you know", "09:18", "the kind of um", "09:20", "uh yeah the control aspect and also the", "09:23", "kind of people that particularly the", "09:25", "sort of", "09:26", "guys that would respond well to hypnosis", "09:28", "and come up on stage and you know", "09:30", "and respond well to it tended to be", "09:31", "exactly the kind of guys that would have", "09:33", "really intimidated me before", "09:34", "so that was like at an unconscious level", "09:36", "and i hope i've grown out of that now", "09:38", "mainly but uh yeah it takes a lot of it", "09:41", "takes a lot of boxes so that that was", "09:43", "that's how i", "09:44", "started and yeah i was definitely driven", "09:46", "by insecurity because", "09:47", "any sort of magic which sort of followed", "09:49", "for me on from the hypnosis", "09:50", "you're basically it is the quickest", "09:54", "most fraudulent route to impressing", "09:56", "people that's you know the subtext is", "09:58", "only", "09:58", "you know look at me aren't i great which", "10:00", "is not that interesting after", "10:01", "after a while so i've tried to you know", "10:03", "as i've as i've grown up i've tried to", "10:04", "move it into a different", "10:06", "area and one that's a little more", "10:08", "resonant than just showing off", "10:10", "that's fascinating that you started out", "10:11", "doing a hypnosis show was it a comedy", "10:14", "show", "10:15", "no it was sort of um i would mainly", "10:18", "perform at", "10:18", "like uh colleges and i'd do a", "10:21", "demonstration and then have questions", "10:23", "and after uh questions and answers", "10:24", "afterwards and", "10:25", "i wasn't making people look stupid it", "10:27", "was an entertainment show and i guess it", "10:28", "was kind of you know funny but it was um", "10:31", "it was uh it's just a really interesting", "10:35", "thing and the trouble with doing it on", "10:37", "stage is of course it gets mixed up with", "10:38", "people just kind of playing along and", "10:40", "stuff so", "10:40", "it's but if you take that out of it it's", "10:43", "just a really interesting area and i've", "10:44", "done this stuff for you know", "10:46", "20 years back home and i'm not i don't", "10:47", "think of myself as a hypnotist that was", "10:49", "just kind of where i started but the", "10:51", "the suggestion based techniques of that", "10:54", "is something i've", "10:55", "continued with and brought into", "10:57", "different areas and i still don't fully", "10:59", "understand it you know now it's", "11:00", "there's you can never quite climb in", "11:03", "inside someone's head", "11:04", "and know what they're experiencing like", "11:05", "i used to do in the when i used to do", "11:07", "these like stage hypnosis shows the last", "11:09", "thing i did was", "11:10", "to i tell these people on stage that i", "11:12", "was invisible right and i'd", "11:13", "i'd float something through the air", "11:15", "right like this bottle i've got here", "11:17", "and it was normally something bigger", "11:18", "like a chair and they'd be freaking out", "11:20", "you know running off stage and so on but", "11:22", "afterwards when i'd have this kind of q", "11:23", "a", "11:24", "i'd um i'd ask them well what was your", "11:26", "what was your actual experience", "11:28", "like like the show's over now be honest", "11:30", "what were you what were you experiencing", "11:31", "and you'd get some people that would say", "11:33", "well", "11:34", "yeah you were obviously just floating", "11:35", "that you were just holding it but i kind", "11:37", "of felt like i had to play along", "11:38", "and then you'd get this interesting area", "11:39", "in the middle of of like well i kind of", "11:42", "i now when i think back yes of course it", "11:44", "was you but it was and i sort of knew it", "11:45", "was you but i", "11:46", "emotionally just completely i could only", "11:49", "experience it as a terrifying", "11:51", "floating bottle or whatever it was so", "11:53", "that's a bit like an actor like getting", "11:54", "caught up in a role i guess", "11:56", "like they know they know they're on", "11:57", "stage and it's a character but", "11:58", "nonetheless emotionally committed", "12:00", "and the other extreme people that would", "12:02", "not accept that it was me floating it", "12:03", "just they", "12:04", "that must have been on a wire or", "12:05", "something there's no there's no way", "12:07", "that i can drop you back in the picture", "12:09", "in my memory of that thing so how do you", "12:11", "know how do you", "12:11", "how do you judge what that experience is", "12:13", "and are those people that are saying", "12:15", "no you were really invisible are they", "12:17", "just saying that because they want to be", "12:18", "like the best", "12:19", "subjects in that in that group i mean", "12:20", "how do you tease it all apart it's", "12:22", "that is the is that that must be a real", "12:25", "issue right the people that just want to", "12:26", "please you", "12:27", "and are playing along how can you tell", "12:30", "if you were hypnotizing people yeah i", "12:32", "can tell but", "12:32", "i the way i use it now is kind of i use", "12:35", "it quite sort of", "12:36", "subtly in the show i don't like overtly", "12:40", "you know hypnotize people um so", "12:44", "that means it can be one of two things", "12:46", "it either means", "12:47", "it just i'm not interested in people", "12:48", "playing along because i'm not just", "12:50", "trying to create the effect of someone", "12:51", "hypnotized", "12:52", "they need to genuinely be responding to", "12:53", "this thing in order for the next bit to", "12:54", "work", "12:55", "uh in which case i have to filter out", "12:57", "anybody playing along but occasionally", "13:00", "occasionally it doesn't matter like a", "13:01", "lot of the time like i'll get people up", "13:03", "on stage and i'll", "13:04", "shake their hand and they're this rapid", "13:05", "handshake induction that", "13:07", "the guy just you know just falls to the", "13:09", "floor um", "13:10", "and there are times that that matters", "13:13", "and they have to be that has to be a", "13:14", "really honest response", "13:16", "other times i can tell they're sort of", "13:17", "half into it and they're just a bit", "13:18", "intimidated and", "13:20", "but for the two thousand people looking", "13:21", "that might look they kind of might look", "13:22", "like the same thing and then it works", "13:24", "exactly does that work the handshake", "13:26", "induction well it's it's a", "13:28", "uh i take no responsibility for", "13:30", "explaining this to your tens of millions", "13:32", "of", "13:33", "listeners and viewers um but uh it's", "13:35", "it's", "13:36", "you're you're interrupting a an", "13:38", "automatic process right this is the", "13:40", "this is the key to it it was made", "13:43", "popular by", "13:43", "um made popular by i guess richard", "13:46", "bandler who's the guy behind", "13:48", "nlp and so on um i don't know if he kind", "13:50", "of created this thing but", "13:52", "perhaps perhaps erickson did before him", "13:54", "i don't know anyway you", "13:55", "you you take an automatic process and", "13:57", "you interrupt it in the middle so like", "13:59", "when you're shaking hands with somebody", "14:01", "that's like such a familiar process that", "14:03", "when you start you're not thinking okay", "14:05", "i'm going to grip this person's hand now", "14:06", "and i'm going to move my hand up and", "14:07", "down with them a few times then i'll", "14:08", "take my hand away you just kind of", "14:10", "do it

minutes half", "18:30", "an hour of relaxing somebody and maybe", "18:32", "suggesting that", "18:33", "their hands were getting light and", "18:34", "floating or heavy and they couldn't lift",

if i", "18:42", "click my fingers you'll go back into the", "18:43", "sleep state", "18:44", "and they you know they kind of get", "18:45", "conditioned to that and it you know", "18:46", "it'll often work", "18:48", "even like a week later and this guy came", "18:50", "and uh", "18:51", "i thought i'd seen him before i thought", "18:53", "he'd been on a previous week", "18:54", "so he sat down and went okay look at me", "18:56", "and sleep clicked my fingers", "18:58", "and he went out whatever that means", "18:59", "right and then we did whatever it was", "19:01", "maybe", "19:01", "you know perhaps he wanted to stop", "19:03", "smoking or his hands floating in the", "19:04", "whatever it wasn't at the end of it i", "19:07", "realized in talking to him that i hadn't", "19:08", "met him before", "19:10", "so then i'm like well how did how did", "19:13", "why did you respond to me clicking my", "19:14", "fingers and because i don't have magic", "19:16", "fingers there's nothing", "19:16", "like anything going on here other than", "19:18", "and i realized it was just that it was", "19:20", "just that moment of my", "19:22", "kind of confidence with it and the fact", "19:23", "fortuitously that he was also very", "19:25", "suggestible", "19:26", "and put those two things together that's", "19:28", "what made it work it was just that", "19:31", "that psychological moment for him that", "19:33", "was more important than", "19:35", "the nature of the 20-minute script that", "19:36", "i'd been learning and using up to that", "19:37", "point so that was kind of a that was a", "19:39", "seminal", "19:40", "so your confidence in that he had", "19:42", "already been under", "19:43", "yeah i didn't question it because i", "19:45", "really i believed he had and it just", "19:46", "kind of it just sort of happened and", "19:48", "then", "19:49", "he just if he hadn't been a suggestible", "19:50", "type then it probably wouldn't have", "19:52", "worked", "19:52", "yeah but luckily he was and that kind of", "19:54", "really really changed the way that i uh", "19:57", "that i you know thought about hypnosis", "19:59", "it also started this", "20:01", "you know this realization that", "20:02", "ultimately my my kind of", "20:05", "tool kit with what i do is is the", "20:07", "stories that people are telling", "20:08", "themselves that's", "20:09", "that's kind of that's really you know", "20:13", "all there is even a magician showing you", "20:15", "a card trick is just getting you to tell", "20:16", "yourself a story", "20:18", "edit edit this event in such a way that", "20:21", "you go oh", "20:22", "you know i picked a card and then it", "20:23", "disappeared it was it was in my pocket", "20:25", "he never went near me and you edit out", "20:27", "all the bits that", "20:27", "don't seem important like when he", "20:29", "complimented you on your jacket earlier", "20:31", "on in the day and may have stuck a", "20:32", "card in there or the bit where he took", "20:34", "the card back for a moment whatever", "20:36", "because you don't you know", "20:36", "you're you're being sold a story with", "20:39", "particular sort of edit points",

can we just we have to kind of reduce", "20:50", "it to stories to make to make sense so i", "20:52", "think", "20:53", "stripping aside all the kind of", "20:54", "vaudeville and tacky associations of", "20:56", "hypnotists and magicians and so on i", "20:59", "think there's something there's", "20:59", "something interesting at the heart of it", "21:01", "i think that that our", "21:02", "storytelling capacity is", "21:05", "kind of endlessly fascinating to me well", "21:08", "it's fascinating in that regard but it's", "21:10", "also fascinating that", "21:12", "there seems to be like some cheat code", "21:13", "to the human mind like there's a", "21:15", "there's a way you can like lock into", "21:17", "like an admin", "21:19", "panel and all of a sudden you're you're", "21:21",

often see it when", "21:37", "performers are doing it", "21:39", "when they're often going for a kind of", "21:40", "theatrical effect if you go and look at", "21:42", "like a", "21:43", "clinical uh environment where hypnosis", "21:45", "is being investigated it isn't like that", "21:47", "at all", "21:47", "um it's much more uh", "21:51", "kind of boring in a way so it doesn't", "21:52", "have any theater attached to it", "21:54", "it's much more on you know kind of", "21:56", "intuitively understandable have you been", "21:58", "hypnotized yourself i'm terrible i'm a", "21:59", "really bad", "22:00", "really bad subject i had one experience", "22:02", "where i only won", "22:03", "when i was um in like a workshop thing", "22:06", "that i was", "22:07", "there as a like a you know a paying", "22:10", "person i wasn't giving the workshop and", "22:12", "um i was sat with the", "22:14", "the the exercise was it it really worked", "22:16", "for me it may work for others", "22:18", "so you split into pairs and uh", "22:21", "the idea is you start to describe a", "22:23", "scene so you sat up a sat with this", "22:24", "woman you close your eyes you", "22:26", "start to describe a scene and you go", "22:28", "back and forth adding details right so", "22:29", "she says", "22:30", "okay i'm laying on a beach and i'm so i", "22:32", "just imagine that like okay", "22:34", "laying on a beach and i can i can", "22:37", "feel the warmth of the sun on my face so", "22:39", "i'm just kind of like imagining it and", "22:41", "joining him with the story", "22:42", "and then i just remember somebody going", "22:46", "okay guys time up time for lunch and i", "22:48", "i had been on a i'd be on a beach and i", "22:50", "had completely just", "22:52", "i'd been there like a dream it was", "22:54", "completely real at some point it had", "22:55", "tipped into that that's the only", "22:57", "experience i've had of it other than", "22:59", "that", "22:59", "i don't respond to i'm just not i think", "23:01", "it's just it's just suggestibility", "23:03", "it's something about uh", "23:07", "and we get it when you know we get it", "23:08", "when a doctor gives us a placebo and we", "23:10", "respond to that because this authority", "23:11", "figure is giving us that or", "23:13", "or the way we absorb uh opinions of", "23:16", "people that we admire and experts that", "23:18", "we admire how we just", "23:19", "more easily take those on board", "23:20", "unquestioningly this is all the same", "23:22", "thing it's just suggestion", "23:23", "um the trouble is it most of the time", "23:26", "it's done through the the world of the", "23:28", "performing hypnotist which isn't", "23:29", "isn't giving really a very clear and", "23:31", "fair view of what's", "23:33", "what's going on because it's so", "23:34", "theatrical and so", "23:36", "yeah because often you you know it", "23:38", "you're you're relishing in things like i", "23:40", "clicked my fingers and this guy went to", "23:41", "sleep", "23:42", "yeah but that's not really you know the", "23:45", "what are they doing they're", "23:45", "are they just are they just kind of", "23:47", "responding because you've just asked", "23:48", "them to and you they know that when", "23:50", "you click the fingers they're supposed", "23:51", "to go to sleep is there's a real range", "23:53", "of possible experiences", "23:55", "that you it might look like a power but", "23:57", "it doesn't mean it is they might just be", "23:59", "just complying yeah i don't i was going", "24:01", "to do some of this stuff on stage", "24:03", "without", "24:04", "using the hypnosis to show that this i", "24:06", "don't think there's anything that", "24:07", "happens under hypnosis that can't be", "24:08", "done without", "24:09", "uh and i was uh having this discussion", "24:12", "with", "24:12", "my friend andy who directs and co-writes", "24:15", "my stage shows with me", "24:16", "and uh i was saying like that thing of", "24:18", "you know when you", "24:20", "when a hypnotist gets someone to eat an", "24:22", "onion and", "24:23", "says you know this is a classic hypnotic", "24:25", "stunt gives them a raw onion and says", "24:26", "it's a delicious juicy apple now eat it", "24:28", "and enjoy it you get somebody", "24:30", "munching into an onion and like having", "24:32", "no problem eating it", "24:34", "and i was like i'm sure that feels like", "24:36", "if you're just going to pull it off", "24:37", "without hypnosis would that just happen", "24:39", "anyway", "24:39", "and andy said i bet i bet you can just", "24:41", "do it anyway and he went to my", "24:42", "fridge took out an onion took a big bite", "24:44", "of it and it was fine", "24:46", "because he's right so he's proving a", "24:47", "point there right so he's in a different", "24:48", "mental state", "24:50", "than somebody going god i dare you to", "24:52", "take a bite of that onion", "24:53", "when suddenly you're like you're", "24:54", "preempting the you know the disgust and", "24:57", "all the reasons not to do it but the", "24:58", "fact that he was just going i bet you", "25:00", "can do it and trying to prove a point", "25:01", "meant he did it and it was fine so that", "25:03", "that was a different mental state and it", "25:05", "worked", "25:05", "that wasn't hypnosis right but the end", "25:07", "result still if you did that on stage", "25:09", "and", "25:09", "pretended to hypnotize somebody first it", "25:11", "would look like you've done something", "25:13", "amazing so", "25:14", "i don't know is it it's it's to me it's", "25:16", "just it's just that story that someone's", "25:19", "telling themselves well didn't it did it", "25:20", "taste like an onion to him or did it", "25:22", "yeah", "25:22", "but it just it's just it would have no", "25:24", "no it would have tasted like an onion", "25:26", "there was no suggestion", "25:29", "does it taste like an apple to them well", "25:32", "i don't know it's like", "25:33", "invisible what are they seeing i think", "25:35", "for some of them it will you know taste", "25:37", "and pain and things like that and", "25:38", "discomfort it's all very subjective", "25:40", "but the end result of doing this thing", "25:42", "that looks like it couldn't happen", "25:44", "without some magical process that's the", "25:46", "key and none of these things", "25:49", "really demand that even even when you", "25:50", "look at people being", "25:52", "undergoing surgery through hypnosis and", "25:55", "being wide awake and being cut open so", "25:57", "you think well that must be", "25:59", "evidence that hypnosis is some special", "26:01", "thing because that couldn't happen", "26:02", "otherwise but", "26:04", "of course it can you know the layer of", "26:05", "skin that feels pain is actually sort of", "26:07", "quite", "26:08", "thin so once you get through that when", "26:09", "you're moving organs around that's not", "26:11", "that's not a painful process anyway plus", "26:14", "very often they tend to use a bit a", "26:15", "little bit of", "26:16", "like a local anesthetic anyway just to", "26:18", "numb the very top layer of skin so again", "26:20", "what looks amazing very often", "26:22", "isn't it's a it's an endlessly rich and", "26:25", "bizarre", "26:27", "area to me and i kind of um as i said i", "26:30", "don't really think of myself as a", "26:31", "hypnotist but the the", "26:33", "that process that kind of uh", "26:36", "ability for people to get into this", "26:40", "space where they can have that kind of", "26:42", "experience is um", "26:44", "is something i you know i'll always find", "26:46", "interesting the one of the", "26:47", "recent stage shows i did uh it's called", "26:50", "miracle i don't know if you've seen it", "26:51", "but i'm faith healing in the second half", "26:53", "so using", "26:53", "exactly the same idea and i've i've got", "26:56", "an audience that are like me you know", "26:58", "they don't believe in that and i'm", "26:59", "saying look", "26:59", "you know i'm an atheist i don't believe", "27:00", "in this either but will you just kind of", "27:02", "go with me at least at the start because", "27:04", "the results", "27:06", "are really interesting and i um i", "27:09", "just started doing this this um faith", "27:11", "healing not really knowing if it was", "27:12", "going to work", "27:14", "i thought well i can get some adrenaline", "27:15", "going and i know could see the", "27:16", "techniques that the", "27:17", "charlatan faith healers were using and", "27:20", "uh", "27:21", "i thought well i'll just you know i'll", "27:23", "do that and i thought well the", "27:24", "adrenaline kills pain so if i get some", "27:26", "adrenaline going there's bound to be", "27:27", "people that said", "27:28", "i had a pain in my back and now it's", "27:30", "gone but the actual results", "27:31", "admittedly with like small percentages", "27:33", "of the audience right not everybody but", "27:36", "uh the people that were coming up and", "27:37", "saying", "27:39", "i had this problem and now it's gone and", "27:41", "there was a woman that had a", "27:43", "she'd been paralyzed down one side of", "27:44", "her body since a kid and she's like in", "27:46", "her 40s now she's in floods of

they're doing any work at", "31:32", "all this thing is taking care of", "31:34", "that for me and that's really powerful", "31:37", "because suddenly it's", "31:39", "it's um that thing if i i don't have to", "31:42", "do", "31:42", "i don't the person thinking i don't have", "31:44", "to make this happen myself there is no", "31:46", "onus on me i don't have to do any", "31:48", "anything this

it's it it's", "36:57", "great if you can put it in a certain", "36:59", "context if not it sadly can be a recipe", "37:01", "i think for anxiety and a", "37:03", "just a feeling of failure that you don't", "37:05", "understand where it's come from", "37:07", "well what i was trying to get at was i", "37:09", "wonder if it's a", "37:10", "component in a much larger picture not", "37:13", "that it's the one thing like the key", "37:15", "like the real problem with the secret is", "37:17", "the idea that", "37:18", "you're taking all these people that are", "37:20", "already successful they've achieved a", "37:22", "certain result", "37:23", "and then you're asking them how did you", "37:25", "achieve that result well i thought", "37:26", "positive and i just really put my mind",

tried and you know they got hit in", "37:37", "the head by asteroids or", "37:38", "car accidents or the the world turned", "37:40", "bad on them i mean that that actually", "37:42", "can happen too", "37:42", "yeah so it's just you're using you have", "37:45", "a biased focus group", "37:47", "exactly everybody yes exactly it's", "37:48", "exactly and the the idea of setting a", "37:50", "goal", "37:51", "fixating on it and ignoring all the", "37:53", "haters and ignoring all the people that", "37:55", "will bring you down", "37:55", "is a perfect recipe for failure as much", "37:58", "as", "37:59", "as it's a common anecdotal story of", "38:01", "success well the problem with that is if", "38:03", "you just", "38:04", "focus on the one the the thing about", "38:05", "human beings i think", "38:07", "is that we really do need other people's", "38:10", "input and interaction", "38:11", "the idea that you're going to work in a", "38:12", "vacuum and create this great masterpiece",

and", "38:21", "messy and ambiguous", "38:22", "and ambivalent and i think the trouble", "38:25", "is we get hung up on nouns like", "38:27", "happiness or meaning", "38:28", "or even the self right because i think i", "38:30", "think actually these things are verbs", "38:31", "they're", "38:32", "maybe we sell as a verb you know maybe", "38:34", "it's something that happens dynamically",

really neat", "38:51", "easy isolated things and uh they're", "38:54", "really not so like in the in the", "38:56", "a lot of the tv shows that i do i'm", "38:58", "putting people through like a", "39:00", "transformative process and they they're", "39:02", "reacting to kind of really extreme", "39:04", "situations", "39:05", "and i always have people saying", "39:08", "oh i wouldn't do that

or three hundred years we've had", "39:31", "this idea", "39:32", "that we are these um kind of uh", "39:37", "it all goes back to like not being", "39:39", "influenced by", "39:40", "kings and

natural world so", "68:57", "an example of this is a great book", "68:58", "called the spell of the sensuous", "69:00", "by david abrams who actually was a", "69:02", "magician originally who went out and", "69:03", "lived amongst his people", "69:04", "and he he talks about this and he said", "69:06", "there was uh he was staying in this", "69:08", "compound this shaman's compound", "69:10", "and the um the shaman's wife", "69:14", "would bring him some fruit every morning", "69:16", "but she also had these little", "69:17", "like banana leaves with rice in and she", "69:19", "would she was going off and doing", "69:20", "something else with those and he asked", "69:22", "where they were going and she said oh", "69:23", "those are the spirits of the house right", "69:25", "so and then she'd come back and without", "69:28", "them he was just wondering", "69:29", "kind of what that meant and what he was", "69:30", "doing so one day he just kind of", "69:32", "followed and", "69:33", "watched her and she was placing these", "69:34", "little pockets of these little things of", "69:35", "rice", "69:36", "out around the perimeter of this", "69:37", "compound and he was watching it", "69:40", "and from a distance and he saw the rice", "69:43", "start to move", "69:44", "and he had a moment of like oh this is", "69:47", "the spirit what is this", "69:48", "and then the rice moved along the ground", "69:50", "and oh it's ants", "69:52", "it's ants so what she's actually doing", "69:53", "she's putting out", "69:55", "rice for the ants so then he had the", "69:56", "thought of oh it isn't spirits it's just", "69:58", "ants", "69:59", "and then you realize no of course the", "70:00", "ants kind of are the spirits", "70:02", "right so this is a house where", "70:05", "food is prepared where they have a lot", "70:06", "of kind of big events", "70:08", "and an ant infestation would be just", "70:10", "disastrous for them", "70:12", "so the spirit the offering to the", "70:14", "spirits of the house is a kind of a", "70:16", "dialogue with the ants it's gonna if we", "70:17", "we're gonna put this rice out can you", "70:19", "just if you just have the rice if we do", "70:21", "this every day will you leave us alone", "70:23", "um and then you know", "70:27", "that's it like it's it's kind of that's", "70:29", "it's quite simple", "70:31", "dialogue and a sort of this lovely kind", "70:33", "of embodied", "70:34", "relationship with with nature that of", "70:36", "course we're so far from here", "70:38", "so interestingly we do tend to pack a", "70:40",

the", "70:47", "unknown stuff and shove it into these", "70:49", "kind of bottomless pits", "70:51", "um whereas actually interestingly if you", "70:53", "trace it back it seems like it just",

they said listen this guy's going to", "95:01", "do something and we're going to help him", "95:03", "and because we need to get this guy off", "95:05", "the streets so let's show that he's", "95:07",
