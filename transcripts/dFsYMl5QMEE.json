things I learned", "07:44", "for both my books for chasing scream and", "07:46", "lost connection is that these forms of", "07:49", "despair depression anxiety addiction", "07:51", "they are meaningful signals right they", "07:54", "are telling us something the fact that", "07:56", "they had been rising year after year", "07:57", "after year that we're now at the point", "07:59", "where average white male life expectancy", "08:01", "has fallen in this country for the first", "08:03", "time in the entire peacetime history of", "08:05", "the United States that is a signal that",

"08:14", "other factors going on like obesity but", "08:16", "that the main drivers are overdose and", "08:19", "suicide and that is telling us something", "08:21", "and what we've been doing up to now is", "08:23", "we've been insulting that signal we've", "08:26", "either been saying depress people", "08:27", "addictive people are just weak all we've", "08:29", "been saying oh it's just a problem in", "08:31", "their brain that there are real things", "08:33", "going on in their brains of course all", "08:36", "we've been saying you know it's just", "08:37", "craziness and but in fact it is largely", "08:42", "a response to the way we're living of", "08:43", "course there are other things going on", "08:44", "as well and we can talk about them and", "08:46", "once you understand that you realize", "08:49", "there's got to be a deeper response and", "08:51", "I went to places that I'd done that not", "08:52", "just whistling", "08:53", "there's a few of those people that", "08:54", "really don't have any talent but they", "08:55", "made the right friends and they cling on", "08:57", "to folks and everybody gets real", "08:59", "uncomfortable well that was the thing I",

"09:13", "read it after Louie a lot of people were", "09:16", "rightly you know criticizing conduct and", "09:19", "you know how many to thing that that's", "09:20", "all valid intro a hundred percent needs", "09:22", "to happen but then there were people", "09:23", "that were like you know Louie was never", "09:25", "funny", "09:26", "or Louie was just you know of course he", "09:28", "got all these things he was a white guy", "09:29", "or and I'm like wait what and there were", "09:32", "like police said this word I don't like", "09:33", "well look at this joke and I'm like guys", "09:36", "a week ago he was a comic genius we all", "09:39", "agreed on that that was a widely held", "09:41", "belief now out of nowhere he's not that", "09:44", "funny and and these people are tweeting", "09:47", "this from parking lots where they're", "09:48", "performing some of these shows in LA or", "09:51", "in like someone's driveway you know yeah", "09:53", "and which is fine I do them I've no", "09:55", "problem with that you know but they're", "09:56", "getting on Twitter and knocking Louie", "09:58", "from the back of a parking lot where", "10:00", "they're doing a show but what you the", "10:01", "reason you gave for why well because", "10:03", "these there's in any industry people are", "10:06", "gonna get ahead by being agreeable by", "10:10", "having the right opinions by", "10:11", "crowdsourcing their opinions by taking", "10:14", "the temperature of the room and going", "10:15", "how does everyone feel and those people", "10:18", "are you know they're careerist they're", "10:21", "very good at office politics they're", "10:22", "very good at having the right friends", "10:24", "but their contributions are never really", "10:27", "important or long-lasting because they", "10:29", "never get great because they don't take", "10:31", "any risk because I think greatness is", "10:34", "something you have to risk constantly to", "10:37", "get to that level yeah so a lot of these", "10:39", "people do very well they make money", "10:41", "they're they're successful but they are", "10:45", "careerist and they're looking for", "10:46", "comfort and so when it was comfortable", "10:49", "and safe to attack Louie and to bring", "10:52", "Louie down and to elevate themselves", "10:53", "they did it but they didn't do it when", "10:56", "it could have hurt their career a week", "10:58", "earlier you know yeah so to me it was", "11:00", "very disingenuous and the fact that more", "11:04", "people weren't calling it out and and I", "11:06", "and I made up", "11:06", "or I said the same thing on the other", "11:08", "side of people who styled themselves", "11:10", "like I'm a free-speech warrior I'm this", "11:13", "anti PC and their whole entire persona", "11:17", "is is that the need to say the n-word", "11:19", "right they're like I can't do a joke if", "11:21", "the punch line isn't fact like they're", "11:23", "like we have to yeah so those to me are", "11:25", "kind of the same people and they're", "11:27", "they're the people that are just trying", "11:28", "to arrange the world in a way that", "11:30", "allows them to succeed",
