pills yeah yeah", "06:44", "no it's like a known mechanism and it's", "06:46", "a known risk factor like I think that's", "06:48", "not being suppressed or hidden it's just", "06:51", "that we are

use what's called a copper IUD", "10:22", "you know it's funny cuz I had one put in", "10:25", "and two and out it costs like $700 and", "10:27", "two and a half weeks later I had it", "10:28", "taken

and you're freaking out it's", "10:40", "just like psychologically felt weird but", "10:41", "um I use something called a daisy which", "10:44", "is like this highly calibrated", "10:45", "thermometer or any track you're you know", "10:48", "because you have six fertile days a", "10:49", "month this isn't you know like some", "10:51", "major sacrifice you have to make in", "10:53", "order to learn

there's a learning", "11:06", "curve you know require", "11:08", "is like learning how to be a woman and", "11:10", "also sharing the onus because you know", "11:13", "with all of these side effects we've", "11:14", "been talking about you know there was", "11:15", "like a male birth control study that was", "11:17", "just terminated because of how many side", "11:19", "effects like the men didn't want to deal", "11:21", "with you know so there's such a", "11:22", "socio-cultural double standard around", "11:24", "this but if we're talking about six days", "11:26", "a month like how do we collaborate and", "11:28", "try and figure something out you know", "11:29", "that doesn't involve a risk of death", "11:31", "perhaps so this Daisy thing just", "11:34", "monitors your temperature and tells you", "11:35", "exactly what's going on yeah I mean it's", "11:37", "a little more sophisticated than that it", "11:39", "actually has the efficacy like above 99%", "11:41", "efficacy if you listen to it that's part", "11:44", "of the you know right room for human", "11:45", "error but it basically just tells you", "11:47", "like have sex now if you want to", "11:49", "conceive or if you don't then don't", "11:51", "rights a little like a little lights", "11:53", "green red or yellow how many women are", "11:57", "on birth control if you had a guess", "11:58", "nationwide you know I would that's a", "12:03", "good question I don't know the stat of", "12:06", "hand upwards of like 10 million I would", "12:08", "say that's a staggering number of people", "12:11", "taking some sort

"prescription in America recently", "13:18", "terrifying it's a new psychotic yeah", "13:21", "will you read the side effects", "13:22", "it's like whoa slow down like what is", "13:25", "this like psychotic thoughts and death", "13:28", "and yeah bleeding and right and if what", "13:31", "you were taking that had similar side", "13:33", "effects isn't working then you can just", "13:34", "layer this on it's very common practice", "13:36", "it's very rare I would say actually for", "13:39", "people to be on just one psychiatric met", "13:42", "it's almost real industry standard to be", "13:45", "taking upwards of I would say you know", "13:47", "two three sometimes even five many of", "13:50", "the patients I work with come to me on a", "13:52", "cocktail of like five minutes

"14:22", "unlikely you'd feel that way", "14:23", "while on a medication that has", "14:25", "consciousness altering effects and a", "14:28", "slew of side effects and so you're going", "14:30", "to be chasing that with other with the", "14:32", "promise of other meds you know a", "14:33", "stimulant because your pixels making you", "14:36", "tired and then you need a benzodiazepine", "14:37",

what makes as well it's like", "31:31", "a total black box but epigenetics is", "31:34", "like how does the environment impact our", "31:36", "genes right so you could argue that a", "31:38", "lot of

a", "32:32", "hundred hundred fifty years like since", "32:34", "the Industrial Revolution right so we", "32:37", "like live totally different lives now", "32:39", "with all these toxic exposures that

is not like a theory it's not a", "62:12", "theory it's right yeah but there's a lot", "62:14", "of stuff like that like there's you know", "62:17", "in the literature there's something", "62:19",
