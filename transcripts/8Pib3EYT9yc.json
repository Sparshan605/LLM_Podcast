be", "06:51", "something else and it's going to take a", "06:52", "lot of trial and error and you know", "06:54", "40,000 dollars an acre to find out so", "06:57", "you have to try different grapes and", "06:59", "then go through a full season and then", "07:01", "test the results well yeah it's more", "07:03", "like a it's more like just looking at", "07:05", "the soil and and that in that

the ground you", "07:31", "don't know for we can might if it come", "07:34", "you know if it sticks around the next", "07:37", "year well then you know you're at least", "07:38", "you got that part then you know it", "07:40", "actually grew then you got to figure if", "07:42", "it's going to get the point where you", "07:43", "can actually train it to start you know", "07:44", "setting fruit on it so you're not going", "07:46", "to see fruit on that vine you can", "07:49", "probably push it and get some fruit on", "07:50", "there the third year but if you really", "07:52", "want quality of

you you went at it about", "09:02", "his most difficult path as possible to", "09:05", "creating them to creating a wine um", "09:07", "that's just it was where I lived and", "09:09", "just having

there's", "10:25", "some nutrient deficiencies as you go", "10:26", "you'll you'll notice right away in the", "10:28", "vines if you're paying attention but you", "10:30", "can also test for it you know it did a", "10:32", "little petals that like the end of the", "10:33", "vine you send them in to just see what's", "10:36", "in them and what's not in them so", "10:38", "they'll be able to tell you roughly what", "10:39", "kind of a wine it will produce no", "10:42", "they'll just play you know whether that", "10:44", "plant is healthy so what it needs", "10:46", "nutrients yes so whether or not I mean", "10:48", "we could plant like I said we can plant", "10:50", "American", "10:51", "it's there and they'll do great thrive", "10:53", "look look awesome but the wines crap you", "10:57",

week of August so I have to", "13:36", "basically be back there to just get", "13:38", "ready and get everything ready what is", "13:40", "the process of the fermentation process", "13:41", "I know you gather up the wine or you", "13:43", "gather up the grapes rather you smash", "13:44", "them and then what happens depends on", "13:46", "depends on how you how you do it there's", "13:49", "some there are some people that you do", "13:51", "the harvest you bring them in and you", "13:53", "actually destem the grapes you put them", "13:55", "in a December it's kind of like a big", "13:56",
