years", "39:13", "but still something exactly concerned so", "39:14", "the timeline of course nobody knows but", "39:16", "i think the timeline is much", "39:18", "the time skills is more stretched out so", "39:20", "20 30 years", "39:21", "and it will continue there'll be", "39:24", "there'll be certain key revolutions", "39:26", "and those revolutions it's a so it's an", "39:29", "incorrect word to use but they'll be", "39:30", "stretched out over time", "39:32", "i think the autonomous vehicle", "39:34", "revolution is something", "39:35", "to achieve a scale of millions of", "39:38",

think", "40:04", "and then of course tesla who's this year", "40:06", "going to approach a million", "40:08", "vehicles and they're trying to achieve", "40:10", "full", "40:11", "self-driving capability but that's going", "40:14", "to be gradual", "40:15", "i just got a new update for the tesla", "40:18", "some new self-driving update it cost", "40:21", "four grand", "40:22", "and i was like what is it you know and", "40:25", "then but uh i think it was high", "40:27", "and i was looking at my phone i was like", "40:28", "hmm okay", "40:30", "let's do it let's do it and so i got", "40:32", "this update but i'm like what did i just", "40:34", "pay for", "40:34", "and i'm not even gonna i don't even know", "40:36", "if i'm gonna use it", "40:38", "but i think it can change i think it", "40:39", "does everything i think it changes lanes", "40:41", "and", "40:41", "yeah well okay so i'm not exactly sure", "40:44", "what the update is but it's probably", "40:45", "see if you can find out jamie so it's", "40:47", "probably the quote-unquote", "40:48", "full self-driving yeah very important", "40:51", "i'm", "40:52", "the safety person i guess on this", "40:53", "podcast tesla cannot drive itself", "40:57", "fully autonomously you have to keep your", "40:59", "eyes on the road", "41:00", "i saw a guy sleeping on the internet and", "41:02", "he was fine", "41:03", "yeah well in a car how cold", "41:06", "i'll look into it was it on cnn", "41:10", "no it was uh someone filmed the guy he", "41:13", "was in his car", "41:14", "passed out not just one it's there's", "41:16", "been a few examples of that", "41:17", "of people commuting on their way to work", "41:19", "without cold so some are for fun and", "41:21", "fake", "41:21", "but it's certainly a real thing that you", "41:23", "pass out and sleep", "41:25", "uh we do that with manual driven cars", "41:27", "too i enjoy", "41:29", "driving home in my tesla from the commie", "41:31", "store like one o'clock in the morning", "41:32", "hitting that autopilot", "41:34", "and i keep my hand on the wheel but it's", "41:36", "just it's a level of relaxation", "41:38", "keep your eyes on the road yes yeah i'm", "41:40", "not looking at my phone or anything", "41:41", "stupid", "41:41", "but it's just like oh you press that", "41:44", "that double button", "41:45", "yeah i just ha and it changes lanes oh", "41:48", "it doesn't change lanes it stays in the", "41:49", "lane it does", "41:50", "it can change lanes but i think you have", "41:52", "to prompt it", "41:53", "like if if you want to like it there's", "41:56", "an option for navigate on autopilot", "41:58", "like it'll like take you everywhere you", "42:00", "need to go but i think you need to step", "42:02", "in at certain points yeah and you", "42:04", "actually so now you can it can change", "42:06", "lanes without you", "42:07", "pressing uh that's what it is now yeah", "42:10", "so you can do it automatically and", "42:11", "they're doing hundreds of thousands i", "42:12", "think", "42:13", "they're tracking the number of automated", "42:14", "lane shades first of all", "42:16", "incredible that this is possible there's", "42:19", "hundreds of thousands", "42:20", "of automated lane changes without human", "42:23", "initiation", "42:24", "happening right now on i mean to me as a", "42:26", "sort of a", "42:27", "robotics person it's just incredible", "42:29", "here it is from whole snack", "42:31", "on twitter it says tesla's new update", "42:34", "lets the car recognize traffic cones", "42:36", "stop signs and stop lines trash cans", "42:38", "stop lights at their colors if you try", "42:41", "to run a stop sign", "42:42", "under autopilot the car emergency brakes", "42:45", "and forces you to take over after", "42:47", "right wow you can't run stops on so the", "42:49", "this isn't the update you paid four", "42:51", "thousand dollars for that's already", "42:52", "that's part of that", "42:53", "but i'm actually surprised so the four", "42:55", "thousand but it says tesla's new update", "42:57", "what's the time on this channel what", "42:58", "what dates", "42:59", "uh december 24th i was like okay for a", "43:01", "more recent so", "43:02", "this this isn't the exact update that", "43:05", "you", "43:05", "the the you pay four thousand dollars", "43:07", "for i think this is", "43:08", "a general part of the full self driving", "43:10", "which is four thousand dollars", "43:12", "and just to be clear again safety person", "43:16", "it's not like it detects traffic lights", "43:18", "but it doesn't stop at the traffic place", "43:20", "for you", "43:21", "and maybe in this case it does emergency", "43:23", "braking on the stop sign but it's not", "43:24", "not good enough it's not it's not", "43:26", "there it's not there don't trust it it's", "43:28", "not there it's in fact this", "43:30", "you know there's a lot of people", "43:31", "including myself think it's we're quite", "43:33", "a few years away", "43:34", "but i've also sort of also on the", "43:37", "podcast", "43:38", "just like you got a chance to talk to", "43:39", "elon musk meet him talk to him in person", "43:41", "and realize that there's you know", "43:44", "there's people in this world", "43:46", "that can make the impossible happen you",

"50:40", "if you look at his biography like the", "50:41", "kind of uh stress he's been under", "50:44", "in terms of he's been at the brink of", "50:45", "losing his his companies", "50:48", "several times yes and he you know", "50:51", "he lost a child and he just he's a", "50:55", "that's the other thing inspired me as", "50:58", "is that he can be a good dad while", "51:01", "running so many

shit", "52:01", "and there's not many people like him", "52:03", "that's that's the interesting thing", "52:04", "that's uh actually the disappointing", "52:06", "thing to me is that he's", "52:08", "uh his kind of thinking is a is a rarity", "52:11", "i'm not yes i'm not sure why that is", "52:12", "exactly", "52:13", "well he's i joke around about it but", "52:16", "it i think there's a there's a spectrum", "52:20", "of evolution", "52:22", "and his mind is clearly way more", "52:25", "advanced than my mind", "52:26", "there's there's something going on in", "52:28", "his mind in terms of

he's the internet and", "52:42", "he's trying to put he's trying to give", "52:44", "the world internet i mean he's got all", "52:45", "these things going simultaneously and", "52:47", "one of the things that i got out of him", "52:48", "when i was talking to him", "52:50", "was that he almost has a hard", "52:54", "time containing these ideas that are", "52:57", "just", "52:57", "pouring out of his head like a raging", "53:00", "river like he's trying to catch", "53:01", "handfuls of water and this raging river", "53:04", "of ideas that's going through his head", "53:07", "you know and when he described his", "53:08", "childhood that he thought that everybody", "53:09", "was like that", "53:10", "and then as he got older he you know", "53:13", "thought he was insane", "53:14", "yeah i mean i've i can relate to that", "53:17", "i've", "53:18", "i'm trying to learn how to talk but i", "53:20", "have trouble talking because uh", "53:22", "there's like a million ideas running in", "53:24", "my head like anything you say i'll", "53:25", "immediately start", "53:27", "there's these like weird tangents that", "53:28", "go off and i want to start thinking", "53:30", "about them", "53:31", "is that true with a lot of people in", "53:32", "your line of work and i think so i think", "53:34", "that's kind of", "53:35", "puzzle solving like that's where the", "53:36", "comfort is i'm just surprised that a ceo", "53:39", "is able to continue being that kind of", "53:41", "puzzle solver", "53:42", "did you see that tweet that he made", "53:44", "about his plans like he put a tweet up", "53:46", "and i think", "53:47", "it was 2006", "53:51", "and then it's he's essentially done all", "53:53", "those things he's done all those things", "53:54", "now the thing is most people", "53:58", "so a lot of people love elon musk but", "54:01", "there's a quite a large community of", "54:02", "people that", "54:03", "don't love him so much well that's", "54:05", "always the case", "54:06", "i don't know i don't think anybody great", "54:09", "i don't know if that's always the case", "54:10", "when is it not the case who does who", "54:13", "accomplishes as many things as that guy", "54:15", "does", "54:15", "where everybody loves them it's a", "54:18", "difficult", "54:19", "i mean i i'm not a historian i could say", "54:23", "steve jobs terrible example", "54:26", "so many people hated that guy so many", "54:28", "people hated that guy i have personal", "54:30", "friends that are involved in technology", "54:32", "that wouldn't use apple products because", "54:33", "he's such a twat", "54:34", "sure they didn't want to have anything", "54:35", "to do with them they knew people that", "54:36", "were engineers under him they said it", "54:38", "was", "54:38", "horrible and mean and it just required", "54:41", "so much would scream at people and", "54:42", "insult them and", "54:44", "you know he had these ideas in his head", "54:46", "that he needed to get done", "54:48", "and if you couldn't work the hours that", "54:50", "you needed", "54:51", "to do what he wanted to to accomplish", "54:54", "you know he would treat you like shit", "54:56", "yeah you're right and", "54:58", "i just wish the world was better i think", "54:59", "because i like with all people like that", "55:01", "like with steve jobs and with the elon", "55:03", "musk", "55:04", "when he dies people will always", "55:07", "you'll remember the greatness right yeah", "55:09", "so that's that's how it seems to work", "55:11", "it's just", "55:11", "sad that you can't celebrate that", "55:13", "currently but i do think there's one", "55:14", "particular aspect of his personality", "55:16", "that i also share", "55:18", "that pisses people off really bad which", "55:20", "is like you said um", "55:22", "he had a plan but he's late on that plan", "55:25", "he keeps promising things", "55:27", "and he keeps being like a year or two or", "55:30", "three late", "55:30", "right and that really i don't know if it", "55:34", "actually angers people", "55:35", "or if people that already don't like you", "55:37", "use that as a thing to say why they", "55:39", "don't like you", "55:39", "but it's certainly a thing that people", "55:42", "say a lot", "55:43", "yeah and but i think that's an essential", "55:45", "element of doing extremely difficult", "55:47", "things is over", "55:48", "promising and trying to over deliver", "55:50", "that's the whole point", "55:51", "right is to to say to make all the", "55:54", "engineers around you believe", "55:56", "that it's doable in a year that's", "55:57", "essential to do it in two years", "56:00", "so like that that kind of and truly", "56:02", "believing it", "56:03", "is uh it seems to be essential well", "56:05", "didn't he have people", "56:07", "pay full price for that roadster", "56:10", "like you got on a list ahead of time", "56:11", "yeah yes so you paid a quarter of a", "56:14", "million dollars for a car that's", "56:15", "essentially vaporware", "56:16", "yeah but the thing so i don't know", "56:19", "there's a little bunch of financial", "56:20", "people that get like mad at that oh yeah", "56:22", "yeah they get scariest like there's", "56:24", "investors you know it's like", "56:25", "it's i think it's the most shorted stock", "56:27", "in history yeah", "56:29", "so but it keeps kicking ass i don't this", "56:32", "confuses the fuck out of people", "56:34", "to me it's the stock market is the most", "56:36", "boring thing ever in people it's it's", "56:38", "like it's a", "56:39", "gambling yes and so you trying to say", "56:42", "you're an expert in investing in the", "56:43", "stock market", "56:44", "i like blocked i remove those people", "56:47", "from my life", "56:48", "because they don't say anything any", "56:49", "interesting ideas", "56:51", "i i said it but that you know when", "56:54", "you're doing legitimate investment", "56:56", "yes that's that's a really important", "56:59", "service to society", "57:00", "but if you're commenting on the", "57:01", "fundamentals of engineering problems", "57:03", "that", "57:03", "real engineers are trying to solve", "57:05", "that's not interesting", "57:06", "uh to me the so it", "57:10", "that kind of stuff upsets i think", "57:12", "financial folks but the beautiful thing", "57:14", "is", "57:15", "when you have people buy vaporware and", "57:18", "you", "57:18", "bring that vaporware to reality that's", "57:21", "the amazing thing yeah", "57:22", "he will definitely bring that roadster", "57:25", "to reality", "57:26", "if he doesn't die that roadster will", "57:28", "happen yeah if he dies", "57:30", "bail out now same with him same with", "57:33", "that insane cyber truck yeah", "57:35", "cyber truck is fucking awesome he's so", "57:38", "ridiculous", "57:38", "he lives long enough you better believe", "57:41", "there's humans being put on mars whether", "57:42", "it's him", "57:43", "or he gets everybody else uh see that", "57:46", "one i'm", "57:46", "skeptical of just the type of people", "57:50", "that are going to want to go", "57:52", "see you're not talking about the", "57:54", "engineering problem no getting people", "57:56", "i think it's possible ultimately you", "57:59", "know i mean", "57:59", "it's look can we put people in space for", "58:02", "sure we've definitely done it", "58:04", "um can we put things well some people", "58:07", "think space is fake", "58:09", "space is fake that's do you ever google", "58:11", "hashtag space is fake", "58:12", "i it's wonderful it's a testament to the", "58:15", "education system in this country", "58:17", "well on that tiny little tangent i've", "58:20", "gotten", "58:20", "i joked about flat earth and space is", "58:23", "fake a little bit almost like saying", "58:24", "that's an interesting way to", "58:26", "being open-minded and then i realized", "58:28", "that's not something to joke about", "58:31", "but there's a community of people that", "58:33", "take it extremely seriously", "58:35", "and then some of them thanked me for", "58:36", "acknowledging that the possibility of", "58:38", "oh and then i had said okay bless their", "58:41", "little hearts", "58:42", "okay this is not the little brains", "58:46", "but i appreciated their open-mindedness", "58:48", "but they should take introduction to", "58:51", "physics", "58:51", "mit open courseware provides courses on", "58:54", "physics", "58:55", "that should um can a regular person just", "58:57", "sign up for that", "58:58", "yeah yeah it's open free so how does", "59:00", "that work um", "59:02", "what do you have to do in order to take", "59:03", "those courses it's all made available", "59:05", "online", "59:06", "just go to mit.org or is it.edu mit", "59:09", "opencourseware is the website", "59:11", "i mean most people oh and it's all on", "59:13", "youtube now oh that's beautiful", "59:14", "it's all lectures they're like millions", "59:16", "of views introductory lectures to", "59:18", "physics mathematics statistics", "59:20", "i have courses on that physics

dingbat you're not going", "59:42", "to be able to absorb all that", "59:44", "look up the wikipedia page for gravity i", "59:46", "think", "59:47", "that's not going to help either they say",

the problem to me", "61:12", "is the type of people that would want to", "61:14", "do it", "61:15", "because they can't return you know", "61:17", "that's the the real issue with", "61:19", "going to

"words on there what's the notes you got", "94:00", "you got pages and pages of notes in", "94:02", "front of you these are stuff that you", "94:04", "really wanted to discuss yeah yeah well", "94:06", "we haven't talked about ai at all but", "94:08", "let me", "94:09", "at least uh bought some dynamics it'd be", "94:11", "interesting to talk about i don't think", "94:12", "there's a fake video that i sent jamie", "94:14", "today these motherfuckers", "94:16", "they keep getting me there's a new fake", "94:18", "video i think that was the same one i", "94:20", "think", "94:20", "someone just took another clip from it", "94:21", "oh is it those guys have been making vfx", "94:23", "videos on youtube for", "94:24", "10 plus years they're really good at it", "94:26", "so it's so good for people who don't", "94:28", "know that there's a youtube channel", "94:29", "where people i think it's a single", "94:31", "youtube channel that", "94:33", "does like yeah visual effects like fake", "94:37", "humanoid or robot dog", "94:40", "robots that kind of resemble something", "94:42", "like boston dynamics", "94:43", "this was one crazy stuff with guns yeah", "94:46", "this one they gave the robot a gun and", "94:48", "have", "94:48", "see if you pull it up jamie what what is", "94:50", "the gentleman the uh", "94:52", "corridor digital on youtube is the guys", "94:54", "that keep that make it quarter the crew", "94:55", "is the youtube channel", "94:56", "fucking incredible but it's not real it", "94:58", "looks so real", "95:00", "and so the uh the robot they kick it", "95:02", "they hit it with a hockey helmet", "95:04", "or a hockey stick rather is there like", "95:06", "long video they made a while ago", "95:08", "they might have made a new one which was", "95:09", "one out in desert but i think i've", "95:11", "seen it before i see they trick you with", "95:13", "the boston dynamics it's boss town", "95:16", "boston dynamics it looks so realistic", "95:20", "but here's the thing we're not that far", "95:22", "off from this thing", "95:23", "no okay okay okay let's let's walk it", "95:25", "back let's walk it back", "95:27", "it it's not realistic uh", "95:30", "in what way so let's see it looks human", "95:33", "realistic so you can tell it's a human", "95:34", "like a robotics person can tell it's a", "95:36", "human", "95:37", "because it's really difficult to do that", "95:39", "kind of motion that kind of movement", "95:41", "oh like when it's getting shot well not", "95:43", "the getting so there's a lot of movement", "95:45", "it does", "95:46", "for the purpose of comedy right like it", "95:48", "actually is on purpose", "95:49", "trying to look like a human for the", "95:52", "comedic internet effect like", "95:54", "getting a human that's getting pissed", "95:55", "off and so on yeah those qualities are", "95:57", "like another order", "95:58", "like this here where it's like give me", "96:01", "that guys oh", "96:02", "come on so for a tournament oh yeah yeah", "96:08", "they're a bruce lee type of uh movements", "96:11", "some of those are just comedic you know", "96:12", "you don't need terminator", "96:13", "uh type robot right but they do have", "96:16", "legitimate robots that can do backflips", "96:19", "now", "96:19", "and do so it's really it's really it's a", "96:21",

"96:41", "robot and the brain of the robot", "96:43", "so these bodies unlike anything else", "96:45", "unlike a roomba", "96:46", "on like a drone who can also be very", "96:48", "threatening", "96:49", "the these bodies somehow we", "96:52", "anthropomorphize them", "96:54", "and they terrify us i don't know what it", "96:55", "is i met spot mini in person", "96:57", "that was one of the most transformative", "96:59", "moments in my life really because", "97:01", "i know how dumb it is but the experience", "97:04", "of it like it's not", "97:06", "even a head it's supposed to be a hand", "97:08", "but it looks like a head and", "97:10", "it like looking up at me with that hand", "97:12", "i felt like i was like", "97:14", "it was magic it was like it was like", "97:18", "frankenstein coming to life is this", "97:20", "moment of", "97:21", "creation and what i realized is my own", "97:24", "brain sort of anthropomorphizing the", "97:25", "same way you're", "97:26", "like looking at these robots and you're", "97:28", "thinking these things are terrifying", "97:29", "yeah like what's like uh you know in 10", "97:32", "20 years where", "97:33", "are we going to be yeah that's our brain", "97:36", "playing tricks on us", "97:37", "because the key thing that's a threat to", "97:39", "humanity or an", "97:40", "exciting possibility for humanity is the", "97:42",

called deepmind and open ai so", "98:47", "google deepmind", "98:48", "uh and a game i know you're a first", "98:50", "person shooter", "98:52", "guy but uh starcraft and dota 2.", "98:55", "so last year these are what you call", "98:58", "them real time", "98:59", "strategy i guess in people win millions", "99:01", "of dollars in esport competitions", "99:04", "and so open ai separately",

on starcraft with", "99:18", "their alpha star system", "99:20", "and the key amazing thing is they're", "99:22", "similar to alphago and alpha zero that", "99:24", "learn to play go", "99:26", "is the mechanism of self play that's the", "99:28", "exciting mechanism", "99:30", "that i think if you can figure out how", "99:32", "to have an impact", "99:33", "on more serious problems than games", "99:35", "would be transformative", "99:37", "okay what is it it's learning from", "99:39", "scratch in a competitive environment", "99:41", "so thinking of you have two white belts", "99:44", "so going to jiu-jitsu so you have you", "99:46", "have two white belts training against", "99:48", "each other", "99:49", "and trying to figure out how to beat", "99:51", "each other without ever", "99:52", "having black belt supervision in", "99:53", "structures and so on and slowly getting", "99:55", "better that way coming up", "99:57", "inventing new moves that way and", "99:59", "eventually they", "100:00", "they get better and better by that", "100:02", "competitive process", "100:04", "that's the machine playing itself", "100:06", "without human supervision the", "100:08", "interesting", "100:08", "thing is there's a lot of cases in which", "100:11", "if you set up the competitive", "100:12", "environment", "100:13", "well enough for those two white belts", "100:15", "they'll learn to be black belts", "100:17", "they'll learn to be not only black belts", "100:19", "they'll learn to be better", "100:21", "than like exactly the kind of evolution", "100:23", "that's happening in mma right now", "100:25", "if you put that in a digital space and", "100:27", "speed it up you know a million fold", "100:29", "it'll continue to improve let me pause", "100:32", "you here because this is one of the", "100:33", "things that i think", "100:34", "probably translates to ai", "100:37", "as it does to jiu-jitsu you need more", "100:40", "than one opponent", "100:42", "like you can't have one input one person", "100:45", "training with one person specifically", "100:47", "and singularly you're not going to", "100:50", "develop", "100:50", "the type of game that you need to become", "100:54", "a real black belt in jiu-jitsu 100", "100:56", "exactly so that's part of the brilliance", "100:58", "of this mechanism", "100:59", "so uh imagine you didn't just have white", "101:02", "belts you had a", "101:03", "opportunity to generate a new random", "101:05", "white belt", "101:06", "like a like a fat big one a little one", "101:09", "right", "101:09", "and all kinds of different ones an", "101:11", "aggressive one daddy bravo", "101:14", "a passive one and then and let them play", "101:17", "and then", "101:18", "so this what you find is like jiu jitsu", "101:21", "might be simpler than the general", "101:23", "problem sort of of", "101:24", "different kind of of like starcraft and", "101:27", "so on", "101:28", "but there is sets of strategies in this", "101:30", "giant space", "101:32", "there these complex hierarchical", "101:34", "strategies like high level strategies", "101:36", "and then specifics of different moves", "101:37", "that emerge some of which you didn't", "101:39", "even realize", "101:41", "existed and that requires that you start", "101:44", "with the huge amounts of random initial", "101:46", "states like the fat person the skinny", "101:49", "person the aggressive person so on", "101:51", "and then you also keep injecting", "101:53", "randomness in the system so you discover", "101:55", "new ideas", "101:56", "so even when you reach purple belt you", "101:58", "don't continue with those same people", "102:00", "you", "102:01", "start your own school you start like you", "102:02", "start expanding to totally random new", "102:04", "ideas", "102:05", "and expanding this way and what you find", "102:07", "out is there's totally surprising to", "102:09", "human beings", "102:10", "like in the game of chess or in the game", "102:11", "of go in the game of starcraft", "102:14", "these this self-play mechanism can do", "102:18", "what sort of ai people have dreamed of", "102:20", "which is be creative", "102:21", "create totally new behaviors totally new", "102:23", "strategies that are surprising to human", "102:25", "experts", "102:26", "that's why go was so astounding to them", "102:29", "right because it's such a", "102:30", "complex game such a hard game and and", "102:33", "it's able to", "102:34", "well the first astounding thing is able", "102:36", "to beat the world champion", "102:38", "yeah the second astounding thing about", "102:40", "both chess and go is it's able to create", "102:43", "totally new ideas sort of i'm not good", "102:46", "enough at chess or go to understand", "102:48", "the newness of them but grandmasters", "102:50", "talk about the way alpha", "102:52", "alpha zero plays chess and they say", "102:55", "there's a lot of brilliant", "102:56", "interesting ideas there like very", "102:58", "counterintuitive ideas and that's such a", "103:01", "and that's all the first breakthroughs", "103:04", "didn't", "103:04", "have as much self-play they were trained", "103:07", "on human experts", "103:08", "but alpha zero and alpha star", "103:11", "and open ai five these systems are all", "103:14", "fundamentally self-play meaning", "103:17", "no human supervision starting from", "103:19", "scratch so no black belt instructor you", "103:21", "just", "103:22", "and that means so they learning from", "103:25", "scratch that's the", "103:26", "that's exceptionally powerful that's a", "103:29", "process from zero", "103:30", "you can get the superhuman level", "103:33", "intelligence in a particular task", "103:35", "in a matter of days that's that's super", "103:39", "powerful super exciting", "103:40", "super terrifying if that's kind of what", "103:42", "you think about", "103:44", "the the challenge is we don't know how", "103:46", "to do that in the physical space", "103:48", "in the space of robots there's something", "103:51", "fundamentally different", "103:53", "about being able to perceive to", "103:55",

dumb logic that's", "104:21", "very tough to build up", "104:23", "that this yeah that's that's", "104:26", "it seems to be an exceptionally", "104:27", "difficult uh learning problem that", "104:30", "boston dynamics will have to solve", "104:32", "in order to achieve even the same kind", "104:34", "of um", "104:36", "physical movement behavior that we saw", "104:39", "in those videos", "104:40",

"105:08", "the objectives we need to inject in", "105:10", "these systems that they're trained on", "105:13", "need to have one uncertainty so they", "105:15", "should always doubt themselves",

boston", "106:04", "dynamics is not opening up their", "106:06", "platform", "106:07", "so they're working with a few people i'm", "106:09", "trying to make", "106:11", "i'm quite busy these days i'm

on", "106:29", "top of it", "106:30", "so you can make it learn you can make it", "106:32", "see the world and so on that's all extra", "106:34", "that's not what boston dynamics", "106:35", "offers so they want to work with people", "106:37", "like me to to add that kind of", "106:39", "capability and that's exciting because", "106:41", "now you can have hundreds of people to", "106:43", "start to add", "106:44", "interesting learning capabilities", "106:48", "and so i may i may have to retract my", "106:51", "words about how far away we are", "106:53", "with the capabilities of these robots", "106:55", "once you now open up to the internet", "106:57", "so i was speaking to boston dynamics i", "106:59", "think they're solving the really hard", "107:00", "robotics problem", "107:01", "but once you open it up to the huge", "107:03", "world of researchers that are doing", "107:05", "machine learning", "107:06", "and doing computer vision and doing ai", "107:09",

pull", "107:42", "that off very", "107:43", "so for now for now and uh", "107:47", "and you had uh you had a conversation", "107:49", "with nick bostrom whom", "107:50", "also talking with on the podcast yeah uh", "107:54", "one of the things he mentioned is so i", "107:56", "don't think he thinks about this stuff a", "107:58", "lot i", "107:58", "i do about military applications i talk", "108:01", "to folks that's one of the things people", "108:02", "don't", "108:03", "just like with meat they kind of put to", "108:04", "the side they don't want to think about", "108:06", "military applications but", "108:07", "i would be more worried about drones", "108:09", "than i would be about", "108:10", "robot dogs right because the kind of", "108:14", "stuff we saw in the black mirror episode", "108:16", "is really difficult to pull off to make", "108:19", "a robot learn", "108:21", "drones are kind of more impressive right", "108:22", "because they they hover they can move", "108:24", "through 3d space", "108:25", "they they have hellfire missiles", "108:27", "attached to them i mean there's a lot of", "108:28", "crazy shit that they can absolutely do", "108:31", "right now with drones", "108:32", "and you're talking about large-scale", "108:33", "drones but you can think of", "108:35", "small-scale drones and i think there's a", "108:38", "i think there's also a black mirror", "108:40", "episode with drones where they", "108:42", "take over i haven't seen that one so", "108:44", "there's a", "108:45", "i think there's drones everywhere and", "108:47", "they're kind of doing uh you know your", "108:49", "basic friendly government surveillance", "108:51", "uh mass surveillance kind of thing i", "108:53", "think it's for", "108:55", "i think they sell in the episode that is", "108:56", "for a good cause", "108:58", "spoiler alert but i think they like", "109:00", "start killing everybody or", "109:02", "uh of course wasn't there uh", "109:05", "there has been research done on making", "109:07", "artificial insects that have like little", "109:09", "cameras inside of them", "109:10", "that look like like a dragonfly or", "109:14", "some some

goes yeah", "119:49", "but i think he the point is nobody knows", "119:52", "what's", "119:52", "what's the best kind of twitter even", "119:54", "having two twitters like do you really", "119:55",

people", "120:12", "and if those people make videos and", "120:14", "maybe they don't have a phd", "120:16", "god forbid like are they not an expert", "120:19", "either am i", "120:20", "right i'm actually personally sick of", "120:23", "the academic", "120:24", "sort of cathedral thinking that just", "120:25", "because you have a phd and", "120:27", "just you can be an expert like i'm not",

do it all", "121:10", "myself and but i i learned that", "121:13", "i do it you know pretty good when you", "121:15", "learn it yourself from scratch just like", "121:17", "with jiu jitsu", "121:17",

a new star wars ride yeah this", "144:26", "crazy star wars ride and there's", "144:28", "the you're it's a 20-minute ride i mean", "144:31", "it's a", "144:31", "crazy long ride and a lot of it you're", "144:34", "in", "144:35", "like a vehicle yes and the vehicle is", "144:38", "all programmed by computers the the", "144:40", "direction of the vehicle the way the", "144:42", "vehicle moves

you go", "144:51", "into this new door the vehicle knows how", "144:53", "to go around the corner", "144:54", "and what's that guy's name darth maul", "144:55", "he's trying to cut through the wall",

"145:07", "went to create this thing i mean it", "145:10", "looks", "145:10", "so crazy i mean you're like how much", "145:13", "money did this cost this is it right", "145:14", "here", "145:15", "so you're riding around in these things", "145:17", "and storm troopers are shooting at you", "145:19", "and", "145:19", "are there rails or no no no there's no", "145:21", "rails man", "145:22",

that's one of them giant four", "145:42", "four-legged robot things that's in star", "145:44", "wars", "145:44", "so you're moving underneath them there's", "145:47", "giant cannons that you have to

think those lines in the ground are", "145:58", "just the wheels", "145:59", "going the same way over and over and", "146:01", "over again yeah no sorry i just wanted", "146:03", "to sort of commentate but", "146:04", "they're probably not using the computer", "146:06", "version that's what so yeah i think it's", "146:07", "probably lidar based it's", "146:09", "uh i don't know what it's based on but", "146:11", "it's some the computer", "146:13", "is coordinating all of these different", "146:15", "things at the same time you go through", "146:16", "this room", "146:17", "and you're seeing battles outside and", "146:19", "you feel it you see the walls get hit", "146:21", "like that", "146:22", "like it's fucking crazy man it's it's", "146:25", "amazing", "146:26", "yeah i mean the ride the line is bonkers", "146:29", "so the robotics aspect to this like the", "146:32", "ai aspect of this", "146:33", "is probably minimal look at that look at", "146:35", "that like you're in this thing you move", "146:36", "through this room", "146:37", "and in the background you're watching", "146:39", "these starships", "146:41", "shooting at each other and the time", "146:44", "perfectly", "146:44", "yeah it's crazy man yeah it's really", "146:47", "cool to make this happen", "146:49", "i mean these are people that are willing", "146:50", "to probably invest hundreds of millions", "146:52", "yeah like in this so guaranteed so i", "146:55", "think there's some", "146:57", "like there's very minimal ai in this", "146:58", "because ai creates uncertainty and", "147:01", "uncertainty is very", "147:02", "undesirable in situations like this yes", "147:04", "yeah i don't think there's any", "147:05", "ai in it but there's some for sure", "147:07", "there's some sort of automation some", "147:09", "computer automation", "147:10", "yeah but it's basic software it's like", "147:13", "it's", "147:13", "software don't call this basic don't you", "147:15", "dare", "147:16", "don't you dare lex it's star wars is not", "147:19", "even real", "147:20", "wow how who are you there's reusable", "147:23", "rockets being launched on a monthly", "147:25", "basis and we're going to colonize mars", "147:27", "for real soon", "147:28", "that's real right that's more", "147:29", "interesting for sure definitely but this", "147:31", "is dope", "147:33", "yeah i'll be here playing fucking", "147:35", "disneyland rides and then i'll go home", "147:37", "and sleep in a bed and breathe air and", "147:39", "fuck you'll be out there on mars", "147:40", "and the history books with nowhere", "147:42", "remember you", "147:46", "history books don't matter once you're", "147:48", "dead yeah i mean", "147:49", "it's nice that we have access to the", "147:51", "history books and i praise the", "147:52", "historians", "147:53", "for sure but uh it's not i'm not", "147:55", "interested in making history", "147:57", "yeah i don't know actually why i said", "147:58", "that because i don't care about the", "147:59", "history books but i do", "148:00", "the just the exciting it's one of the", "148:02", "only ex", "148:03", "uh frontiers that we can actually be", "148:05", "explorers and like we've explored", "148:07", "well the depths of the ocean we haven't", "148:09", "exactly right", "148:10", "yeah but the outer space that's like", "148:14", "man that's that's like the most exciting", "148:16", "[Music]", "148:17", "for engineering and science that we can", "148:19", "explore and the mind like i mentioned", "148:20", "like we don't know shit about the mind", "148:22", "and exploring that with the neuroscience", "148:25", "with ai", "148:26", "just all of that the cautions the all", "148:29", "the other thing you talked about", "148:30", "with boston simulation yeah and some i", "148:33", "wanted to talk to you about that too", "148:34", "um because you brought up boston what", "148:37", "are you", "148:37", "bostrom relies on i mean he was relying", "148:41", "on theories in terms of like", "148:43", "mathematical theories of probability", "148:46", "to to say that he thinks", "148:49", "it's more likely that we're in a", "148:51", "simulation", "148:52", "yeah he has he has a the thing he's", "148:55", "articulate i don't think he's come up", "148:56", "with the idea of the simulation he just", "148:58", "kind of", "148:58", "really thought about it deeply he came", "149:01", "up with a simulation", "149:02", "argument which is these three categories", "149:04", "that he described to you possible", "149:06", "outcomes i think", "149:07", "uh the first one is we destroy ourselves", "149:10", "before we ever create a simulation the", "149:12", "second one is", "149:13", "that we would lose interest in creating", "149:16", "a simulation at some point and the third", "149:18", "one is", "149:19", "uh we're living in a simulation yeah", "149:21", "where do you lean", "149:24", "i think uh to", "149:28", "i think there's going to um the three", "149:31", "paths that he highlighted it makes it", "149:32", "sound like it's so clear that it's just", "149:34", "three but i think there's gonna be a", "149:35", "huge amount of possibilities of the", "149:37", "kinds of simulations", "149:38", "like to me i keep asking uh you know to", "149:41", "ask elon musk", "149:42", "he's uh about the simulation we he said", "149:46", "uh what's on the other side what's", "149:47", "outside the simulation", "149:49", "yeah i think i asked uh what would you", "149:51", "ask an agi system", "149:52", "he said what's outside the simulation is", "149:53", "the question yeah he believes in it", "149:56", "i or at least he entertains it as a", "149:58", "troll the", "149:59", "elon musk embodies like", "150:02", "the best of the twitter internet troll", "150:06", "a meme and a brilliant engineer and", "150:09", "designer in one", "150:10", "it's like a yeah it's like a quantum", "150:12", "state that you can't quite", "150:13", "figure out like what's the coupling", "150:15", "because i don't know if he's trolling", "150:16", "but i'm the same way i love asking", "150:18", "people about the simulation even though", "150:19", "i get a little bit of hate from the", "150:20", "scientific community", "150:22", "but it it pushes why do you get hate", "150:24", "from the scientific community about", "150:26", "simulation because it's uh it's", "150:28", "ridiculous notion if you think of it's", "150:30", "like literally that because it's not a", "150:33", "testable thing", "150:34", "we don't know how to test like why are", "150:36", "you talking about this", "150:37", "why do you sit down with elon musk and", "150:40", "talk about the simulation we", "150:41", "when you're sitting with a world expert", "150:43", "in particular aspects of rockets or", "150:45", "robotics like i'm an expert what i can't", "150:48", "believe i just said that i'm not", "150:49", "explaining anything but i know about", "150:50", "a few things about autonomous vehicles", "150:52", "why don't you talk to them about that", "150:54", "right why don't we talk about simulation", "150:56", "well the thing is the simulation", "150:58", "pushes you outside of the muck the", "151:00", "messiness of everyday details of science", "151:03", "and makes you ask big questions about", "151:05", "like the nature of our reality", "151:07", "and i i like to think of it as", "151:10", "like what how would we build a", "151:12", "simulation like", "151:13", "what would be a compelling enough", "151:14", "virtual reality game that you wouldn't", "151:16", "stay there for all", "151:17", "your your whole life that's a first step", "151:20", "there that's", "151:21", "useful to think about like what is our", "151:23", "reality", "151:24", "what what aspects of the our most", "151:27", "interesting for us humans to be able to", "151:30", "perceive", "151:30", "with our limited perception cognitive", "151:32", "abilities interpret and interact with", "151:35", "and then the bigger question then is", "151:37", "like how do you build", "151:38", "a larger scale simulation that would be", "151:40", "able to create a virtual reality game", "151:42", "which i think is a possible future we're", "151:45", "already", "151:46", "creating virtual worlds for ourselves on", "151:48", "twitter and social networks and so on", "151:50", "i really believe that virtual reality", "151:52", "will we will enter", "151:54", "we'll spend more and more of our lives", "151:56", "in the next 50-100 years", "151:58", "in virtual worlds and the simulation", "152:02", "hypothesis the simulation discussion is", "152:03", "part of that i think", "152:07", "i think there's the question of what's", "152:08", "outside simulation is really", "152:10", "interesting that's the other way of", "152:12", "because", "152:13", "like what created us what started the", "152:15", "whole thing it's the", "152:17", "modern

"152:29", "fascinating question but arguing that", "152:32", "we're already living in a simulation", "152:33", "i think you've got stuck on that little", "152:35", "point", "152:36", "i think it's not that there's a bit of a", "152:39", "language barrier", "152:40", "too there's a la there's a technical", "152:42", "yeah", "152:43", "i think it's legit it's funny it's funny", "152:46", "nick is a

have", "163:42", "a closer connection with ai systems i", "163:44", "don't know one of the things in this", "163:46", "book", "163:46", "that i'm in the middle of with what i'm", "163:49", "actually
