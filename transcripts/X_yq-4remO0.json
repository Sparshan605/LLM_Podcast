scary", "07:42", "creepy disease", "07:43", "well this doctor he was absolutely", "07:45", "convinced that the two of them were", "07:46", "correlated he said that there's", "07:47", "something going on with Lyme disease", "07:49", "that produces this thing where you you", "07:52", "start seeing these fibers coming out of", "07:53", "your body and you know we had a ton of", "07:56", "people descend in videos and show us", "07:59", "images and they had slides they had", "08:01", "prepared they were convinced these", "08:02", "fibers were coming out of their skin and", "08:05", "so doctors oftentimes just completely", "08:08", "label it as a psychosomatic disorder but", "08:11", "this one doctor who had it said I", "08:13", "believe that the correlation is Lyme", "08:15", "disease and it completely makes sense", "08:17", "what listen to what you're saying the", "08:19", "other thing is everything is a", "08:21", "psychosomatic disease right I mean", "08:23", "there's not idiots

and I'll just tell you the", "09:21", "full story and I was gonna in my life I", "09:24", "like I was at that point I was", "09:26", "functional but ten percent of the time", "09:28", "maybe like an hour a day I couldn't work", "09:30", "the only thing I was going to be was", "09:32", "burden my friends and my family and I", "09:33", "was just like are you at the time thirty", "09:36", "um and in the middle of this I was it", "09:40", "was what I was still living in Los", "09:41", "Angeles a friend of mine showed up my", "09:43", "door and said we're going surfing your", "09:45", "fucking mind I can't walk across the", "09:48", "room I mean I literally I couldn't do it", "09:50", "and she wouldn't shut up and wouldn't", "09:52", "leave and wouldn't leave and wouldn't he", "09:54", "try to drown you and after like bitch", "09:56", "it's hard to make a witness gonna drown", "09:57", "me for hours of this or three hours it I", "10:01", "was like fuck it let's go surfing today", "10:03", "I mean what's the worst that can happen", "10:05", "right I'll always kill myself tomorrow", "10:07", "right and dragged me out to Sunset Beach", "10:09", "and they literally sorta had to walk me", "10:12", "to the car right take you know by the", "10:14", "shoulders because I was really weak and", "10:15", "you know they gave me a board the size", "10:17", "of a Cadillac and the bigger the board", "10:18", "the easier it is to surf and this was", "10:20", "enormous and was a tiny day like waves", "10:22", "were like two feet at best and we were", "10:24", "so crappy nobody was even out but the", "10:26", "water was warm and they sort of like", "10:28", "they took me by the elbow and they", "10:28", "walked me out to the break and I was out", "10:30", "there and I knew how to surf a little", "10:32", "bit it been a long time so it served at", "10:33", "that point but thirty seconds later a", "10:36", "wave came and you know I don't know what", "10:38", "have a muscle memory took over whatever", "10:39", "but I spun my board I paddled a couple", "10:41", "times and I popped up and I just popped", "10:43", "up in a dimension I didn't even know", "10:44", "existed right something around my vision", "10:47", "I felt like see out of the back of my", "10:49", "head and I felt amazing", "10:52", "felt like that kind of full throttle", "10:54", "lifetime and slowed down none of it made", "10:57", "any sense it felt so good I caught like", "11:00", "four more waves that day and by the", "11:01", "fifth wave I was just I was disassembled", "11:03", "they kind of put me back in the car and", "11:05", "drove me home and I was so sick after", "11:08", "that that I was I got into bed and", "11:11", "people had to bring me food for like two", "11:12", "weeks cuz I couldn't walk to my kitchen", "11:14", "which is like 60 feet away this exhaust", "11:16", "I was not surfing time but on like the", "11:19", "15th day which the day I could walk", "11:20", "again caught another ride back to the", "11:23", "beach", "11:23", "and I did it again right and again I", "11:25", "have this crazy altered state of", "11:27", "consciousness experience and you know", "11:29", "again I was disassembled this time maybe", "11:30", "was like 13 days that I was in bed and I", "11:33", "did it again and over the course of", "11:34", "about six to eight months with the only", "11:36", "thing I was doing differently in my life", "11:37", "was surfing", "11:38", "I went from about 10% functionality to", "11:41", "about 80% functionality so my first", "11:43", "question is the fuck is going on right", "11:46", "like as I said earlier the surfing is", "11:48", "not a known cure for chronic autoimmune", "11:51", "so and I lit out on a giant quest the",
