releases", "74:52", "their truck I'm coming out soon", "74:54", "I sent Elon a picture of a truck and I", "74:57", "said hey man this looks fucking dope", "74:58", "he's like that's not really our truck", "75:00", "mmm yeah he said it was his words it", "75:03", "it's more blade runner-esque that's what", "75:06", "he said it's more than that not sure", "75:08", "yeah that the picture that I think", "75:10", "you're talking about the black one", "75:11", "that's already pretty running but that I", "75:14", "could tell us fake yeah if he's gonna", "75:16", "make a truck he has to have more of a", "75:17", "bed space in the back right I think he's", "75:20", "trying to make something yeah that's", "75:22", "fake that's like that looks fucking dope", "75:24", "man it looks pretty Tron - I like the", "75:26", "lights oh my god that looks amazing", "75:28", "but I think whatever he's doing is gonna", "75:30", "look even doper than that but no one is", "75:33", "saying it it's somehow or another been", "75:35", "able to keep it under wraps", "75:37", "yeah that's good how many people have", "75:40", "trucks you know in the United States", "75:42", "that's gonna be a game-changer I'm", "75:44", "surprised that he hasn't released it yet", "75:46", "because it's American yeah that's an", "75:48", "American product I mean all these people", "75:50", "that wanna like it's a weird thing like", "75:52", "people argue oh Lord fuckin engines and", "75:54", "Ford and sure", "75:55", "you know like they think that's American", "75:57", "we'll guess what else is American Tesla", "75:59", "that's an American invention it's", "76:00", "American like and it's good for the", "76:03", "environment you love the outdoors yes", "76:04", "you do good get a fucking electric car", "76:07", "drive around on that yeah it's the best", "76:09", "part it's uh he's gonna be interesting", "76:12", "to see what it looks like have you got", "76:13", "solar at your house yet you ever try to", "76:14", "fuck with the Tesla solar we were going", "76:16", "to get the Tesla roof panels but our", "76:19", "roof has the wrong pitch for whatever", "76:22", "that means out direction yeah so we have", "76:24", "another set up another solar panel Hass", "76:26", "yeah but the I think solar is in", "76:29", "California it's a silly thing to not", "76:32", "have it's like you can get all your", "76:35", "power from the sky it should be the law", "76:37", "every house has to have it well I think", "76:40", "it's a matter tell like Tesla has these", "76:42", "solar panels that act as tiles he looks", "76:46", "like roof tiles and look really good", "76:47", "those are real nice roof tiles but I", "76:49", "think you know they didn't have that ten", "76:51", "years ago and ten years from now they", "76:53", "probably have something even more", "76:54", "efficient", "76:54", "the real problem is battery capacity", "76:56", "like battery capacity is the thing that", "76:58", "holds back these electric cars and they", "77:01", "think they're gonna be able to fix that", "77:02", "too and they think with new battery", "77:03", "technology you're going to be able to", "77:05", "get more mileage and to be able to", "77:06", "charge far quicker that's gonna be the", "77:09", "real game-changer", "77:10", "cuz once people there's a lot of people", "77:11", "that like Brendan Brendan Schaub he's", "77:13", "like resisting the Tesla driving rise", "77:15", "like you driving that again he gets mad", "77:16", "because like why are you traveling your", "77:18", "muscle cars I'm like I

you realize how fast", "77:28", "they are it's like it time travels it", "77:31", "just goes just just it just cuts the", "77:34", "distance between spaces in a way that no", "77:37", "other car can do I don't I've never seen", "77:39", "another car that and and it does that", "77:40", "without being obnoxious like it doesn't", "77:42", "go bad it doesn't make some crazy loud", "77:46", "noise it just goes whoosh Elon should", "77:49", "definitely have an update where it makes", "77:51", "your car speakers match with your your", "77:54", "acceleration like it's so you feel like", "77:56", "you're inside like a rumbling car while", "77:58", "you're driving down they do how they", "77:59", "have that with some cars which people", "78:01", "get mad at it apparently the new", "78:03", "Corvette pipes fake sound into your into", "78:05", "the car because when when they make cars", "78:08", "that are turbocharged", "78:09", "when you have forced induction with", "78:11", "turbocharged these these turbos they", "78:14", "make the engine sound shitty like a", "78:17", "naturally aspirated engine as the", "78:19", "loudest most rumbly kind of an engine", "78:21", "and when you have turbo charges it mutes", "78:24", "the sound of the engine because although", "78:25", "I don't know why I guess it's because of", "78:27", "all the forced air they they don't sound", "78:30", "as good so what they've been doing is", "78:32", "they've been forcing like fake sound", "78:34", "like BMW does that like when you're", "78:36", "driving the car and you hear the cool", "78:37", "acceleration sound it's kind of fake", "78:39", "it's coming in through your speakers", "78:41", "yeah this is really weird", "78:43", "they're about to release a fart Warren", "78:45", "also that test yeah I've heard about", "78:47", "that that's a great idea I saw this", "78:48", "video today and you started mentioning", "78:50", "something that triggered it did you see", "78:51", "have you seen this yet says solar a", "78:53", "game-changer for technology developed in", "78:55", "San Antonio to pull water from humid air", "78:58", "so this guy Moses West he was retired", "79:00", "and it took him four years he developed", "79:02", "this machine called a AWG I'm trying to", "79:05", "find out what that stands for but it's a", "79:08", "big machine that pulled literally makes", "79:09", "drinking water from the air at very low", "79:11", "cost he said lower the cost in ground", "79:13", "water Hey well he already has them in", "79:16", "Puerto Rico the Bahamas and

I was like that", "79:34", "just pulls from the air and I was like", "79:35", "dad why can't you drink it and he's he", "79:37", "says it's too uh it's still water so you", "79:39", "can't you know you can't drink still", "79:42", "water right like it's not you know what", "79:44", "like pond water kind of shit no like", "79:46", "that little water it's not still water", "79:48", "the water you can buy distilled", "79:50", "distilled water right yeah it's not good", "79:52", "for you got to add electrolytes to it", "79:53", "the science behind the technology is a", "79:55", "simple

yeah", "80:29", "and I was I'd looked on the other day I", "80:31", "was sixty-two percent you made of the", "80:32", "outside I was like this is Oh that's", "80:34", "Ohio levels like it's crazy right now", "80:36", "there's just the other down I was must", "80:38", "have been cloudy day so on a regular day", "80:41", "but is it ever zero percent humidity", "80:43", "it's not no it's let it's

hot day in LA", "81:05", "they could get water out of the air", "81:07", "that's amazing yeah he's just it's this", "81:11", "is new as far as I know it's probably", "81:12", "not a brand new

I'm really hoping and", "81:25", "I've talked to many technologists that", "81:28", "believe this as well that technology is", "81:30", "going to be the solution for our our", "81:31", "environmental
