"73:37", "Nov 8 is it a powerlifting only brand or", "73:41", "lifting knee so they have lifting shoes", "73:45", "that I wear from my overhead events then", "73:47", "I wear like they're barefoot shoes mmm", "73:49", "that's what I do for like my moving", "73:50", "events and when I deadlift and then they", "73:53", "also have like hiking like shoes that", "73:55", "are like anti-slip that I'll use like", "73:58", "when I do truck pull or pushing events", "73:59", "as well yeah and now are their sponsor", "74:01", "working on it come on innovate they sent", "74:04", "me a bunch of stuff for free", "74:05", "so it's better than nothing yeah totally", "74:09", "and they're honestly they're the most", "74:10", "comfortable shoes I have worn when", "74:11", "training let me see what that looks like", "74:13", "let me see with them innovate shoes look", "74:14", "like I don't know go with the barefoot", "74:17", "one let me see what that looks like", "74:18", "they're super light - yeah yeah", "74:20", "that's what I think I like about them -", "74:22", "even their like their weight lifting", "74:23", "shoes are light because those are you", "74:25", "like clunky and heavy and I'm really", "74:27", "like especially like when I'm doing like", "74:28", "a split jerk trying to move my feet fast", "74:29", "right last thing I want is heavy things", "74:31", "on my feet okay yeah those are the", "74:33", "lifting shoes that I have I like that so", "74:36", "the platform in the back yeah so they", "74:38", "have a raised heel about what 3/4 of an", "74:41", "inch", "74:41", "now that's for when you're lifting like", "74:43", "it's almost like standing on plates", "74:44", "right yes yeah that'd be like if they're", "74:46", "squatting I'm using that and then I like", "74:48", "it for overhead lifts just because it", "74:50", "gives you a little bit more stability", "74:51", "now why do you have to stand on plates", "74:54", "like what is the idea behind that like", "74:55", "the just raise the back raising the heel", "74:58", "in it takes out the issue of ankle", "75:00", "mobility", "75:01", "in a lift like a squat mmm so there's a", "75:04", "lot of restriction in the ankle and the", "75:05", "Achilles if they're tight and that'll", "75:07", "prevent you from that'll either cause or", "75:09", "prevent you from your knees tracking", "75:10", "properly it'll put extra strain on the", "75:13", "hips and on the ankles so doing that it", "75:16", "kind of takes the ankle complex out of", "75:18", "the motion and makes the the movement", "75:21", "easier you can eat keep a more upright", "75:22", "spine a little bit more comfortable lift", "75:24", "so that's usually the thought process", "75:26", "behind it so when you have that elevated", "75:28", "heel then you don't have to stand on", "75:30", "plates or anything like that I just use", "75:31", "it just yeah just just a shoe yeah so", "75:34", "that it's interesting that there's", "75:37", "different you were different ones for", "75:39", "different events yeah so the pulling for", "75:42", "the truck tire one you use a hiking one", "75:44", "so you're saying so this will be my", "75:45", "first time using that typically we use", "75:47", "rock climbing shoes because real grip", "75:50", "super grippy and especially like we're", "75:52", "pulling on asphalt usually mm-hmm so", "75:54", "that'll dig into the asphalt these ones", "75:57", "that I have from innovate now they're", "75:58", "they they're like anti slip and they", "76:01", "have gripping

way he carried it was just like", "103:09", "resting round in his diaphragm and he", "103:11", "didn't pick it up high enough to go onto", "103:13", "the platform so he just ran into the", "103:15",

"didn't move a muscle he just goes so", "103:35", "it's just like any passing out kind of", "103:37", "like a normal part of what we do I can", "103:40", "only imagine it does", "103:41", "so it doesn't sound good when I'm saying", "103:43", "it out loud but well it makes sense", "103:45", "though I mean the fucking insertion does", "103:47", "anybody have heart attacks not typically", "103:51", "it's it has happened the only person", "103:56", "that comes to mind is a guy I can't", "103:59", "remember what year his name was Jesse", "104:01", "maroon day and he did have a heart", "104:04", "attack in the gym when he was training", "104:06", "and that's how he passed away and he was", "104:08", "only I believe he's only 28 or 29 years", "104:10", "old it happens in jiu-jitsu yeah guys", "104:13", "get hard tax training and then you know", "104:15", "I mean another thing is like sleep apnea", "104:16", "because the guys are so big so that", "104:18", "causes a lot of stress on the heart do", "104:19", "you use a CPAP machine or anything I", "104:21", "don't I don't need one you know I'm", "104:24", "pretty fortunate that I don't have that", "104:27", "issue when I sleep you know but a", "104:30", "previous coach mind Mike Jenkins he", "104:32", "passed away in 2013 because of sleep", "104:35", "apnea and you know just the strain on", "104:37", "his heart so yeah that's not good it's", "104:39", "basically not sleeping yeah and you're", "104:42", "suffocating yourself yeah it's crazy so", "104:44", "a lot of the guys that this level do but", "104:46", "I mean that but that's mainly like", "104:47", "because of their size dude and I have it", "104:49", "really yeah yeah yeah it's might have", "104:53", "fat tongue but that's all the years of", "104:57", "fighting like with that neck you", "104:58", "musculature and all that development", "105:00", "there yeah for some reason like I've", "105:02", "kind of you know got lucky Joseph all", "105:05", "all players have it for sure how our", "105:06", "lifter so I think when you want once you", "105:08", "get around the 300 pound body weight", "105:09", "like do you snore not terribly hmm on", "105:14", "planes I do but that's because my bad", "105:17", "mouth just opens up yeah exactly yeah so", "105:22", "a good place to sleep now or just sit in", "105:24", "general when you're near 300 pounds it's", "105:26", "what's so fascinating to me when you", "105:28", "think about people that explore the", "105:30", "boundaries of what a human body's", "105:32", "capable of and strongman is like what", "105:35", "there's like guys who do like David", "105:37", "Goggins that do like the ultra marathons", "105:39", "but strongman is like that's another", "105:42", "form of this extreme pushing of the", "105:46", "boundaries of what what your body is", "105:50", "capable and when you look at the", "105:52", "progression of the sport it just has", "105:54", "slowed-down like if anything it's gotten", "105:57", "even like the weights keep getting", "105:59", "heavier every year", "106:00", "everybody keeps getting faster and like", "106:03", "all those like when the fuck is this", "106:04", "gonna stop you know like we show up to a", "106:08", "contest now like alright there was", "106:10", "literally a contest in 2018 where the", "106:12", "deadlift was 880 pounds for reps wait", "106:16", "what's the fuck dude", "106:18", "and there was a motherfucker that pulled", "106:19", "over 5 is so much crazy and so it's like", "106:23", "all of us are like where does it stop", "106:25", "like does it stop you know like the the", "106:27", "log press world record is 502 pounds", "106:30", "overhead right now you know it's just", "106:32", "like these crazy outlandish numbers but", "106:35", "like the people like we keep doing them", "106:37", "so I guess we're doing it to ourselves", "106:39", "to a point I guess so but do you like", "106:43", "what is pushing it is it just that you", "106:46", "is it a preconceived idea of what's", "106:48", "possible and now that the bar has been", "106:50", "moved and now you realize that or is it", "106:53", "just that people are more scientific", "106:57", "about their training now I think that's", "106:58", "what it is I think it's um and it's also", "107:00", "like when you the the evolution of", "107:02", "equipment over the years you know like", "107:03", "with rogue being more our main equipment", "107:04", "sponsor now they make Australian", "107:07", "equipment so like regular people have", "107:09", "strong and equipment in their gyms you", "107:11", "know like they're like PT clinics that", "107:13", "have farmers handles in them for people", "107:15", "to work on core musculature and posture", "107:16", "when they're walking so I think just", "107:20", "like the general availability of", "107:22", "strongman equipment is made it easier", "107:23", "for people to train it more regularly", "107:25", "and get better at the events because you", "107:28", "we have to practice you know like being", "107:30", "strong is great but you have to be able", "107:32", "to manipulate the movement and", "107:34", "manipulate the implement to work and", "107:36", "that's where just like the training and", "107:37", "the practice portion of it comes in so I", "107:40", "think that's why we've seen you know a", "107:42", "lot of these weights being pushed so", "107:44", "much further because everybody pretty", "107:47", "much has regular access to these", "107:49", "strongman implements now mmm it just", "107:51", "it's interesting to me that you're", "107:52", "saying that the weights are getting", "107:54", "heavier and people are getting faster", "107:55", "it's like then I'm thinking like how", "107:57", "long have people been doing this when", "107:59", "was the first strongman competition I", "108:01", "mean strongman dates back to like the", "108:03", "1700s really well yeah kind of shit like", "108:06", "barrel throw", "108:07", "yeah really um I mean when Rob was on", "108:10", "you know he was talking about the show", "108:11", "strongest man in history that was just", "108:13", "on History Channel and they they went", "108:15", "back into the history books to look at", "108:17", "old you know quote-unquote strong men", "108:19", "doing these strengths these feats of", "108:21", "strength all throughout you know I think", "108:23", "one of the most notable names is Louis", "108:25", "Cyr a guy from Canada who was about my", "108:29", "size actually and is revered to be one", "108:32", "of the strongest men in history and so", "108:34", "when he was doing like these dumbbell", "108:36", "lifts and these back two lifts and these", "108:37", "hip and thigh lifts and stuff like that", "108:39", "so strongly it's been around for a long", "108:42", "time but World's Strongest Man didn't", "108:44", "become a thing until the 70s mmm that's", "108:46", "when world Strongest Man I think 77 was", "108:50", "the first year of world Strongest Man", "108:51", "and that's when it kind of became a", "108:54", "sport you know and not just a kind of a", "108:58", "hobby", "108:59", "I guess so how do they determine what", "109:01", "stuff you're gonna do for the world", "109:03", "Strongest Man did they I mean did they", "109:06", "have a panel of experts that sit down", "109:08", "and devise each individual event yeah I", "109:12", "mean it's it's come a long way from what", "109:14", "it was in the 70s I mean they used to do", "109:15", "like medleys with like potato sack races", "109:17", "back at world Strongest Man a long time", "109:19", "ago now it's a little more standardized", "109:21", "where they do have like a committee", "109:23", "where it's you know people from the", "109:26", "strongman circuit and judges and stuff", "109:29", "like that but they also bring TV execs", "109:31", "because they want stuff that's gonna", "109:32", "look cool you know be and I think that's", "109:35", "a great thing because you don't want", "109:37", "it's like stuff that is cool to me isn't", "109:40", "gonna look cool to somebody that doesn't", "109:41", "know anything about the sport sometimes", "109:43", "so when they choose the events like", "109:47", "pulling two monster trucks like okay one", "109:50", "it's you have to be strong as fuck to be", "109:52", "able to do it but it also looks really", "109:54", "cool on TV so they try to find that", "109:56", "marriage of both of those things to make", "109:58", "it the most pleasing to the average", "110:01", "participant but also impressive exactly", "110:03", "you know like the deadlift event they", "110:05", "don't have us yeah so this is that's", "110:07", "Marquette that's Marc Felix yeah so this", "110:09", "is one of the world records that he did", "110:10", "how old is he what he's doing this this", "110:12", "was 53 right so this was actually just", "110:15", "this past July this was that when", "110:17", "Wembley Stadium oh my god or well the", "110:20", "arena in London the Hercules hold what a", "110:23", "great name so each of those pillars", "110:25", "weighs 400 pounds and he's just chillin", "110:28", "and you just have to hold it as long as", "110:29", "you can the size of his fucking", "110:32", "shoulders yeah that is preposterous it's", "110:35", "dumb that dude has preposterous muscles", "110:40", "that's ok how long does he hold this", "110:43", "fucker fine he goes over one minute yeah", "110:45", "I mean it's crazy no this is a world", "110:49", "record reading what kind of after this", "110:51", "is what 122 drops it yeah what kind of", "110:54", "breathing you doing here like does it", "110:55", "help to breathe in deep and heavy or so", "110:58", "chest during an event like this it looks", "111:00", "30", "111:00", "that is crazy that's exactly dude black", "111:03", "don't crack they're not lying guys it's", "111:06", "amazing so with with an event like that", "111:09", "it's more just real and I try to relax", "111:12", "and getting into like a calm mental", "111:14", "state because you don't want to be super", "111:16", "revved up because you're not moving", "111:17", "you're just focusing on your grip and", "111:19", "that's the biggest thing for an event", "111:21", "like that but then there's also events", "111:23", "we're like okay when you're maxing your", "111:25", "deadlift you do have to hold your breath", "111:26", "right so it's different for everything", "111:28", "you do it goes up to his wrist that's", "111:35", "that's incredible that's amazing though", "111:37", "that he can hold those fucking things", "111:39", "for that long was I got minute I wasn't", "111:40", "a minute 23 seconds and for reference", "111:43", "like I I was at that contest and did it", "111:45", "for like 42 seconds oh that's crazy now", "111:47", "how do you prepare for someone dead do", "111:50", "you like you don't hold those things", "111:53", "like you just work on your grip but no", "111:55", "usually I'm honestly self set up like a", "111:56", "pulley system in the gym so use just", "111:59", "like regular handles that use them like", "112:00", "a cable machine set up a pulley on like", "112:03", "a squat rack or like one of the rogue", "112:04", "rigs have loading pins coming down stack", "112:08", "weights on that and then just holding", "112:10", "yeah or even just doing something as", "112:13", "simple like pull up holds like dead", "112:16", "hangs from a barbell yeah right from a", "112:18", "pull-up bar how long can you dead hang", "112:19", "for I've done over a minute that's", "112:22", "impressed okay guys that heavy yeah yeah", "112:25", "so honestly usually would go my", "112:27", "shoulders usually get tired before", "112:28", "anything else", "112:30", "yeah just from like holding it and so", "112:33", "you must have like crazy tears all over", "112:36", "the place and shit like if you ever got", "112:38", "your your labrum checked or anything", "112:40", "like that", "112:40", "good a must now I'm looking at you", "112:43",
